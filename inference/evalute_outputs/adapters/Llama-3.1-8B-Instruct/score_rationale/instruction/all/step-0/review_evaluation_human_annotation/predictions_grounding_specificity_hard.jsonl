It provides a specific observation that tighter confidence intervals (CIs) with finetuning are expected due to taskspecific finetuning increasing confidence for a specific task while potentially reducing generalizability. However, the comment does not offer any actionable suggestions or guidance on how the authors might enhance the novelty or address this limitation. Without specific advice or examples, the feedback is 3 as it identifies a potential area for improvement but lacks depth and actionable steps. Therefore, it aligns with a score of 3."}
