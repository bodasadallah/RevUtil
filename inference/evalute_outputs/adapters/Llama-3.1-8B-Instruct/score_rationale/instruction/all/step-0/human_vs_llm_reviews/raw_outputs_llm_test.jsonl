However, the comment does not provide specific examples or references to support this claim, making it difficult for the authors to understand the exact nature of the limitations or impacts being referred to. Without detailed justification or evidence, the claim remains somewhat verifiable, as it highlights an area for improvement but lacks concrete support.

This is a critical area that authors should address to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their work. However, the comment does not offer specific suggestions or guidance on how to address these issues, such as what specific limitations or impacts should be discussed or how to frame the ethical considerations. While it highlights an important area for improvement, the lack of actionable advice limits its helpfulness.
