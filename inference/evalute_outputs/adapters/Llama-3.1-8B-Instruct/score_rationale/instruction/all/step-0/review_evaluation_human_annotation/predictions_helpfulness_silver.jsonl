The reviewer acknowledges that these methods may not always be applicable and typically require a supervised setup, but suggests that some could be adapted to language tasks relatively easily. This reasoning is 3 as it provides a logical basis for the suggestion, but it lacks specific examples or references to support the claim that certain methods from computer vision could be adapted to language tasks. Therefore, the comment is rated as 3.", "helpfulness_rationale": "The review comment provides a constructive suggestion for improving the paper by recommending a comparison to methods from the computer vision setting. It acknowledges that some of these methods may not be directly applicable but suggests that they could be adapted to language tasks with relative ease. This feedback is actionable and offers a clear direction for the authors to enhance their work by exploring comparisons that could provide more valuable insights. However, the comment could be more helpful if it specified which methods from computer vision could be relevant or provided examples of how they might be adapted.
