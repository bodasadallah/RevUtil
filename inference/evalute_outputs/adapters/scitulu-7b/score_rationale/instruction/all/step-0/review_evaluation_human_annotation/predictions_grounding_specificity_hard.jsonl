However, the comment lacks specific examples or references to existing text GANs or SeqGAN implementations to support the claim. Without these details, the authors may find it challenging to understand the basis of the claim and address it effectively.

It also points out that SeqGAN is mentioned but not tested with a pretrained version. This feedback is clear and actionable, as it directs the authors to include comparisons with existing text GANs and test SeqGAN with a pretrained version. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly enhance the comprehensiveness and relevance of their work. However, the comment could be more helpful if it provided specific examples of existing text GANs or detailed guidance on how to conduct the comparisons.
