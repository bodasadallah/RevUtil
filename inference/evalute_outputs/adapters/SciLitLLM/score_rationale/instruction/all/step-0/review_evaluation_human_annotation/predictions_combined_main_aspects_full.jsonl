The authors are left to infer the potential benefits of this comparison, which makes the claim 3. Therefore, the comment is rated as 3.", "helpfulness_rationale": "The review comment suggests that including a comparison to a specific method from the computer vision setting would be more useful than comparing to lossbased sampling. It acknowledges that these methods may not always be applicable but suggests that some of them could be adapted for language tasks. This feedback provides a clear direction for the authors to consider a more relevant comparison, which could enhance the paper\"s utility and relevance.
