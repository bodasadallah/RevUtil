Therefore, the comment is fully grounded and specific, aligning with category 5.', 'grounding_specificity_label': '5', 'verifiability_rationale': 'The review point claims that the paper could be improved by making comparisons more systematic with respect to the tuning of each method. It references the work of Zemel et al. (2013) as a related work and suggests that the present paper explains how it is different and provides comparisons in simulations. However, the comment does not provide specific examples or detailed reasoning on how the current comparisons could be improved or what aspects are lacking in the current analysis. This makes the claim somewhat verifiable, as it highlights an area for improvement but lacks detailed justification or examples. Therefore, the comment is rated as 3: Somewhat Verifiable.', 'verifiability_label': '3', 'helpfulness_rationale': 'The review comment identifies a specific area for improvement in the paper, suggesting that the comparisons between the present work and the related work of Zemel et al.

It provides a clear and actionable suggestion to compare the best performance of each method, which would enhance the comprehensiveness and rigor of the evaluation. This feedback is valuable as it directs the authors to a concrete step that could significantly improve the clarity and depth of their analysis.
