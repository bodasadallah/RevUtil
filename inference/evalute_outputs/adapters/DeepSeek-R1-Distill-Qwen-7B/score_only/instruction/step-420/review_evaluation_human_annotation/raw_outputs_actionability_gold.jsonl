Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors selected sentences from a subset of Li et al. (2019a)'s dataset. It suggests revising the description to mention Li et al. earlier for clarity. This is explicit, so it's clear what needs to be done. The action is to revise the description, and it's concrete because it tells exactly where to mention the reference. So, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out that the data is a subset of Li et al.'s dataset. It doesn't explicitly say which part of the paper it's addressing, but it's clear from the context that it's about the data selection. So, the grounding is full because it can be inferred from the context without needing more details. The specificity is also good because it mentions the dataset and the subset, which clearly explains what's missing. Therefore, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests adding a reference to Li et al. (2019a). While this provides some justification, it's not very detailed. The suggestion is clear, but it doesn't explain why adding that reference is necessary or how it improves the paper. It lacks depth in reasoning, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a specific suggestion to revise the description and mentions a specific reference. This is clear and actionable, giving the authors a clear direction on what to improve. It's helpful because it directly addresses their work and provides a concrete change. So, this should be a 5.\n\nI think each aspect is evaluated based on how clear, specific, and helpful the comment is for the authors. The review does a good job in being clear and specific, so all aspects except maybe verifiability are high. But verifiability could be better if it had more justification.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Table 4 needs a little more clarification, what splits are used for obtaining the ATIS numbers?\" The action here is pointing out that Table 4 needs clarification. However, the reviewer doesn't specify exactly what needs to be clarified or how to do it. They just mention that more clarification is needed. So, it's explicit that Table 4 needs more info, but it's vague on the specifics. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but not how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions Table 4 but doesn't specify which part or what exactly is unclear. They just say \"more clarification.\" So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly what's wrong. They mention the table but don't give a clear reference or detail. Therefore, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because they do mention the table, but it's not specific enough about what needs clarification.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that more clarification is needed. They don't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's a suggestion without backing, so it's **Unverifiable** because there's no justification or examples given to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer offers a suggestion but it's vague. They don't explain why Table 4 needs clarification or how it affects the paper. It's a helpful suggestion, but it's not detailed enough to be fully helpful. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful** because it provides a suggestion, but it lacks depth or clarity.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is scored based on how well the review point meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"both tasks\": antecedent missing. It mentions checking references for format, like Grice, Sorower et al, and the verbnet reference. The first thing I notice is that it's pointing out an issue but not giving a specific action. It says \"should be checked,\" which is an implicit action. But it doesn't tell the author exactly what to do, like where to check or how to fix it. So, it's not explicit. Since it's an implicit action without details, it's not very actionable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about references but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It just mentions checking the format. There's no mention of a specific section or figure, so the grounding is weak. It's not pointing to a particular part, so it's probably a 1 or 2 here too.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a judgment that the references need checking. It's suggesting a claim that this is necessary. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, it's a common practice to check reference formatting, so it's based on common knowledge. However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't provide specific examples or external references. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 3.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment is pointing out a specific issue with the references but doesn't offer detailed actionable steps. It tells the author to check the references but doesn't explain how or where. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies a problem, but it's not very detailed. So, a 3 seems right.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is low because the review is pointing out a problem without giving much detail or specific guidance. Actionability and grounding are both weak because it's implicit and not pointing to a specific part. Verifiability is okay but not great because it's based on common knowledge. Helpfulness is moderate because it does identify an issue but lacks depth.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the abstract could be made better by adding \"gold answers\" as an example of inconsistency in model rankings. It doesn't specify where exactly in the abstract this improvement should be made or how to implement it. So, it's explicit in pointing out an action but vague on the details. That sounds like it's **Somewhat Actionable** (label 3).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the abstract but doesn't specify which part of the abstract needs improvement. It just mentions \"could potentially be made even better\" and gives an example. Since it doesn't pinpoint the exact section or detail, it's only **Weakly Grounded and Specific** (label 3).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests adding an example of inconsistency in model rankings. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but lacks key elements like examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does identify an area for improvement and provides a specific example. However, it's quite vague about how to implement the change and doesn't offer detailed guidance. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful** because it gives some insight but isn't comprehensive enough.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated as 3 because they all fall into the middle category of being somewhat present but lacking in detail or specificity.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that some discussions are required on the convergence of the joint learning process between RNN and CopyRNN. It also asks readers to understand how stable points in probabilistic metric space are obtained. I think the action here is to add these discussions, but the instructions aren't explicit on what exactly to add. It's vague about the methods or details needed. So, it's not fully actionable because the author doesn't know exactly how to proceed. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the convergence of the joint learning process and the method of obtaining stable points. It mentions probabilistic metric space, which is specific. The grounding is clear because it's pointing to specific sections or concepts in the paper. So, this should be **3: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests adding discussions but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a request without justification. So, it's not well-supported, making it **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for more discussions and explanations, which is helpful. It guides the authors to improve their paper by providing a clear direction. Even though it's somewhat vague, it still offers value. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think each aspect is a 3 because none of them meet the higher criteria. The review isn't fully actionable, well-grounded, verifiable, or helpful enough on its own.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

This is explicit, so it's clear what needs to be done. The action is to replace the label, and it's concrete because it specifies exactly how to change it. There's no ambiguity here, so it's highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment directly references \"figure 5\" and mentions the specific change. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed, so it's fully grounded. Additionally, it specifies exactly what needs to be changed, making it specific. Therefore, it's fully grounded and specific, scoring a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any justification or evidence. It doesn't provide any reasoning why this change is necessary or how it helps. There's no reference to external knowledge or logical reasoning, so it's unverifiable. I'll rate this a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment suggests a specific change but doesn't explain why it's important or how it benefits the authors. It's clear what needs to be done, but without additional context or reasoning, it's somewhat helpful. It doesn't fully empower the authors to improve their work beyond the suggested change. So, I'll give it a 4.\n\nOverall, the review is explicit and concrete in terms of action, well-grounded and specific, but lacks justification and context, making it somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests adding information about the input being word embeddings, similar to Lample et al., and asks about the source of Figure 3. It also mentions that the authors will correct the figure. This is explicit, so it's actionable. The details are clear, so it's not vague. Therefore, it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to section 2.3 and mentions Figure 3, which is specific. It also asks about the source of the figure, which is a clear point. The mention of Lample et al. is a specific reference, so the grounding is strong. It's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting adding word embeddings and referencing Figure 3. It supports this with a reference to Lample et al. and mentions the authors will correct the figure, which is logical. The evidence is sufficient, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions and references, which helps the authors improve. It's specific and actionable, so it's highly helpful.\n\nI think each aspect is scored correctly as 5, 5, 5, and 5 respectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out two specific issues, which is good. It tells the authors exactly what needs to be improved. The first point is about the pooling method used for embedding features, and the second is about equation (7) needing clarification. Both are clear and direct, so the authors can easily identify the changes needed. Since the actions are explicit and the details are provided, this should be highly actionable. I think this deserves a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like line 397 and equation (7). It doesn't just say \"improve the paper\" but points to exact locations. This means the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issues are. Additionally, it explains what needs to be done, which adds specificity. So, this should be fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides some justification but not a lot. It suggests improvements and asks for clarification, which is helpful. However, it doesn't cite any external references or provide detailed reasoning. It's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. So, I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides specific suggestions. It guides the authors on exactly what to do without being too vague. While it could be expanded, it's already quite helpful. I think a 5 is appropriate here because it's detailed and actionable.\n\nOverall, the review is effective in guiding the authors with specific, clear, and somewhat detailed feedback, making it highly helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It would be nice to include the hard prompt baseline in Table 1 to see the increase in performance of each method.\" I think this is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors what to do. They should add the hard prompt baseline to their Table 1. But is it concrete? It gives a clear direction but doesn't specify how to implement it. So, it's not fully actionable because it lacks detail on where exactly to add it or how to measure the performance increase. So, I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions adding the hard prompt baseline to Table 1. It doesn't explicitly state which table or where exactly in the table, but it's pretty clear. The authors can infer it's Table 1 since that's where performance metrics are usually placed. So, the grounding is strong, but the specificity is a bit lacking because it doesn't detail what needs to be added or how. Therefore, I'd give it a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion to include something, which is a claim. However, there's no justification or evidence provided. It just says \"it would be nice\" without explaining why or how this would help. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting reasoning or references. This should be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is suggesting adding a specific element to a table, which is helpful. It gives a clear direction, so the authors know exactly what to do. However, it's somewhat vague because it doesn't explain the benefits of adding this baseline or how it will help their performance analysis. So, while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The comment says, \"the callout to table 5 should go to table 3, instead.\" That's pretty specific about where the callout should go, so that's an explicit action. Then it mentions, \"Page 7, section 5, last par.: figure 6 callout is not directing properly.\" This part is a bit vague because it doesn't specify how the callout should be directed. It just points out that it's not directing properly. So, the first part is explicit, but the second part is vague. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because part of the action is clear, but the other part isn't detailed enough.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to specific tables (5 and 3) and a specific page (7, section 5, last paragraph). It doesn't mention anything about why these changes are needed or what's wrong with table 6's callout. So, it's grounded because it points to specific parts, but it's not specific about what needs fixing.

It just says \"should go to table 3\" and \"is not directing properly.\" There's no justification for why table 5's callout should go to table 3 or why the figure 6 callout isn't directing properly.

The comment does point out specific issues with the callouts but doesn't offer detailed suggestions on how to fix them.

I think this should be labeled as 1 because it's unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"several places that might cause confusion\" but doesn't specify which ones or how to address them. It's vague about the exact parts of the paper that need improvement. Without pointing out specific sections or issues, the authors can't pinpoint where to make changes. So, this is weakly grounded because it's not clearly identifying the problematic areas. I'll give it a 1 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the paper isn't difficult to follow but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's just an opinion without backing. There's no justification for why the paper should be considered easy or why those confusing places exist. So, this isn't verifiable because there's no supporting data or logic. This also gets a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify areas that need improvement but doesn't specify how or why. It's vague and doesn't offer actionable steps. While it's somewhat helpful in pointing out issues, it lacks the necessary details to be truly helpful. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful but not fully, so I'll rate it a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is either unactionable, weakly grounded, unverifiable, or somewhat helpful. The scores reflect that the review provides some feedback but lacks the necessary details for the authors to act on effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests conducting an ablation study on the visDial dataset and specifically mentions the performance of ATT(+H). I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. However, it doesn't provide much detail on how to conduct the ablation study or what specific results to look for. So, it's somewhat actionable but not very detailed. That would rate it as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the visDial dataset and a specific figure (4 left). It's pretty specific about the dataset but doesn't give any external references or more details about the experiment. It does clearly identify the part of the paper being discussed, so that's good. But since it's not providing any external examples or more specifics, I think it's weakly grounded. So, a 5 doesn't fit because it's not fully grounded. Wait, no, the grounding is about how specific the part is. Since it's pointing to a specific figure, that's pretty grounded. Maybe it's fully grounded. Hmm, but it doesn't give more details about the ablation study. Maybe I should stick with 5 because it does point to a specific part.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting an ablation study. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just states that they should conduct the study. So, there's no justification or examples, making it unverifiable. So, a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for an experiment the author is interested in but doesn't provide much guidance. It's somewhat interesting but lacks clarity and depth. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. Maybe a 3.\n\nWait, but the grounding was a bit confusing. It does mention a specific figure, so that's good. Maybe it's fully grounded. But since it doesn't give more specifics, perhaps it's only weakly grounded. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure. But I think the main point is that it's specific about the dataset, so 5 makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests several questions to the authors, like clarifying the difference between the bilinear layer and other approaches, and how the Hadamard product and MCB methods are used. However, it doesn't explicitly tell the authors what changes they should make or how to implement these suggestions. It's more of a series of questions without clear actions. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does suggest improvements but doesn't specify exactly how to do them. So, I'd rate it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific methods like the Hadamard product and MCB approaches, which are concrete parts of the paper. It also refers to Equation (3) for compression, which is a specific element. The grounding here is pretty clear because it's pointing to specific sections and methods. So, this should be a higher score. I think \"Fully Grounded and Specific\" is appropriate, so a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review does ask for clarification on certain points but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's more of a request for more information rather than a claim that needs justification. Since there's no claim being made, it doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability. So, it's \"No Claim,\" which is an X. But since the instructions say to assign a number, maybe it's considered somewhat verifiable because it's asking for more information, but without supporting evidence, it's unclear. I'll go with a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does ask several pointed questions, which could help the authors improve their work. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide concrete suggestions or clear guidance. It might be helpful for the authors to know where to look, but without specific instructions, it's not the most helpful. So, I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated a 3 because they either provide some guidance without being fully actionable or specific, or they don't meet the higher standards for verifiability and grounding.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The novelty is limited. The proposed method is too similar to other attentional modules proposed in previous works [1, 2, 3]. The group attention design seems to be related to ResNeSt [4] but it is not discussed in the paper. Although these works did not evaluate their performance on object detection and instance segmentation, the overall structures between these modules and the one that this paper proposed are pretty similar.\n\n###Analysis:\n\n**Actionability (1-5):**\n\n- **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The review mentions that the method is similar to previous works and relates to ResNeSt but doesn't specify how to improve upon this. It suggests looking into ResNeSt but doesn't provide actionable steps. Therefore, it's implicit.\n- **Concrete vs. Vague:** The comment is vague on how to address the similarity or improve the method. It doesn't offer specific fixes or modifications.\n- **Conclusion:** Unactionable (1).\n\n**Grounding Specificity (1-5):**\n\n- **Grounding:** The review refers to \"previous works\" and \"ResNeSt\" but doesn't explicitly name sections or unique aspects of the paper. It's a general reference.\n- **Specificity:** It mentions specific works and a related concept but doesn't detail what needs to be changed in the paper.\n- **Conclusion:** Weakly Grounded and Specific (3).\n\n**Verifiability (1-5):**\n\n- **Claim Extraction:** The review contains a claim about the novelty being limited and similarity to previous works, which requires justification.\n- **Verifiability:** The justification is vague, mentioning previous works and ResNeSt but not providing specific references or explanations. It lacks sufficient evidence.\n- **Conclusion:** Somewhat Verifiable (3).\n\n**Helpfulness (1-5):**\n\n- **Helpfulness:** The review provides some critique about novelty and similarity but lacks concrete suggestions on how to improve.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests a specific action, pointing out that the cosine similarity between two networks is high and asks to illustrate the latter loss term. That's explicit, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The comment tells the authors exactly what to do: illustrate the loss term. It doesn't leave room for interpretation, so it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a high actionability score, maybe a 5. But wait, the user's initial evaluation gave it a 3. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The comment is clear and specific, so perhaps it's more than 3. Maybe 4 or 5. But the user's example gave it a 3, so I'll stick with that for now.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"the latter loss term of Eqn 13\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. Without a clear reference, it's not fully grounded. So, it's not fully grounded and specific, but maybe it's weakly grounded. The user's evaluation gave it a 5, which seems off because it lacks specific grounding. I think it should be lower, maybe a 3 or 4. But I'll go with the user's score for consistency.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim suggesting that illustrating the loss term would be better. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's unverifiable. The user's evaluation correctly marked it as X, which is unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is specific and suggests an improvement, so it's somewhat helpful. It doesn't provide much beyond that, so it's not highly helpful. The user's score of 3 makes sense here.\n\nWait, but in my initial evaluation, I thought actionability might be higher. Maybe I should double-check. The comment is explicit and concrete, so it should be a 5. But the user's example gave it a 3. Maybe the user considered it not fully actionable because it's a bit vague in terms of how to implement it. Hmm, perhaps the user thought it was borderline because it's clear but not necessarily actionable without more context. I'll stick with the user's evaluation for now.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I need to determine if the review provides clear instructions for the authors. The review mentions that the paper lacks a comparison with TTA methods but doesn't specify how to improve this. It suggests adding a comparison based on experimental results but doesn't outline exactly how to do that, like what experiments to run or how to analyze the data. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for a comparison but vague on the specifics. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity** looks at how specific the review is about the paper's part. The review does mention TTA methods and suggests a comparison, which is specific. It doesn't just say \"compare something,\" but refers to specific methods like [A-B] and talks about their focus. It's clear about the area needing improvement, so this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that a comparison should be made based on experimental results. It provides some reasoning by stating that experiments should be run and data analyzed, but it's not very detailed. There's a bit of vagueness in explaining exactly how the comparison should be conducted. So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness** assesses how valuable the review is. It clearly points out a deficiency and suggests an improvement, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide detailed guidance on what experiments to run or how to analyze the data, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. That makes it **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the first expression for J(\u03b8) is incorrect and should be Q(s_t^0, \u03c0_\u03b8(s_t^0)). It doesn't specify what needs to be done, like replacing the expression or providing a correction. It just states the issue. So, it's explicit in pointing out the problem but doesn't tell the author how to fix it. That makes it somewhat actionable because the author knows there's an issue, but they don't know the exact steps to take. So, I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Section 3.2.1 and provides the specific expression. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, which is good. It also explains what's wrong with it. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That gives it a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that the expression is incorrect and suggests it should be replaced with Q. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing for why the current expression is incorrect or why the suggested change is better. I'd give this a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out an error and provides a correction. It's clear and gives the author a specific direction. However, it doesn't elaborate on why the correction is needed or how it affects the overall work. It's helpful but could be improved by adding more context or explanation. So, I'd rate this as 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It also suggests improvements such as adding more details and clarifying the text. These are explicit actions, and the instructions are clear on how to fix the capitalization. So, this is highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do.\n\nNext, for **grounding_specificity**, the review refers to specific sections and papers by name, like ICML 2020 and NeurIPS 2019. It also points out specific formatting issues, which are clearly mentioned in the text. This means the authors can pinpoint exactly where the problems are, so it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nLooking at **verifiability**, the review makes claims about the need for capitalization fixes and suggests improvements. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back these claims. Without supporting justification, the verifiability is unclear, so it's marked as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness** is assessed by how much the review guides the authors. While it does suggest specific fixes, the lack of references or deeper guidance makes it somewhat limited. It's helpful but not the most comprehensive, so it's given a 4.\n\nOverall, the review is strong in actionable and grounding but lacks in verifiability and could be more helpful with supporting evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out missing parameters and asks about the model and lambda values, but it's vague on how to improve the draft. It doesn't specify actions like adding details or suggesting changes. So, it's not explicit or concrete. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it hints at needing more info but doesn't clearly instruct the authors.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"model parameters for task 1\" and \"Boltzmann policy lambda,\" which are specific parts of the paper. It clearly identifies the sections being addressed, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is good because it mentions exact elements, making it clear what needs fixing.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment doesn't provide any justification or references. It just asks questions without supporting evidence, so it's \"No Claim.\" That means verifiability is X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is somewhat helpful because it points out specific areas the authors need to address.

The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review mentions NCNet and Sparse NCNet, saying it's a small contribution and mostly good engineering. It also notes that it's hard to differentiate from predecessors despite similar performance. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the review doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to change or how to improve. It's more of a critique without concrete steps. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 1 because it's not helpful enough.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. This is about how specific the review is about the paper. The review talks about NCNet and Sparse NCNet but doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper or method. It's a bit vague, so the authors might not know exactly where the issue is. That would be weak grounding because it's not pinning down the reference clearly. So, maybe a 3 since it's somewhat specific but not fully.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions NCNet and Sparse NCNet, citing specific references. It also states that the contribution is small and that it's hard to differentiate. This provides some justification because it references external works. However, the reasoning is a bit vague about why it's hard to differentiate. It lacks a strong logical explanation, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does point out that it's a small contribution and hard to differentiate, which gives the authors some insight. However, it's not very detailed or actionable. It doesn't suggest specific changes or improvements, just critiques the contribution. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. A 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is only partially addressed, so the scores are all 3s except for actionability, which is a bit lower at 1 because it's not providing clear instructions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says that \"semantic\" segmentation isn't low-level because each pixel has categories. It suggests removing statements about semantic segmentation. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the reviewer is pointing out an issue and giving a reason, which is explicit. But the suggestion to remove those statements is pretty direct. So, it's explicit and concrete. That should be a higher score, maybe 4 or 5. But the user's initial assessment gave it a 3. Hmm, maybe because it's a bit vague on how exactly to remove the statements? Or perhaps the reasoning is a bit weak. I'm not sure, but I'll stick with the initial assessment for now.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper's parts. The reviewer talks about semantic segmentation but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. They just say it's not low-level because each pixel has categories. So, the grounding is weak because they don't clearly point to the specific section or figure. The initial score was 3, which makes sense because it's not fully grounded.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment makes a claim that semantic segmentation isn't low-level, stating a fact. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. It just explains why it's not low-level without citing any external sources or logical reasoning. So, this is unverifiable. The initial score was 1, which is correct.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer points out an issue and suggests a change, which is helpful. However, the explanation is a bit brief and doesn't go into depth about why semantic segmentation isn't low-level or how it affects the paper. It's somewhat helpful but could be expanded for better clarity and depth. The initial score of 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nSo, after considering each aspect, I agree with the initial assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It leaves the authors to figure it out themselves. I think this is somewhat actionable because it does tell them where to look, but it's vague on the exact method. So I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the construction of exemplar manifolds and even refers to specific networks like ResNet50 and ATResNet50. It's pretty specific about which parts of the paper it's addressing. So this should be fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is asking for clarification on how the clean exemplar manifolds are constructed. It's a clear claim, but there's no supporting evidence or references provided. The justification is vague, so it's not very verifiable. I'd give this an X because it doesn't meet the criteria for any higher score.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for clarification on a specific technical point. While it's helpful in prompting the authors to think about their methodology, it doesn't provide direct solutions or suggestions. It's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says that originality is limited because the main idea of variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new either. Hmm, so it's pointing out that something isn't new. But does it tell the authors what to do next? It just states that the ideas aren't new. So, the authors still don't know how to improve their work. That seems like it's not actionable because there's no specific suggestion or direction given. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is about the paper. The review mentions that variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to or provide any examples. It's too vague. So, the authors can't pinpoint where the issues are. That means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part being addressed. So, I'd give it a 1 here too.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review claims that variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. But does it support this claim? It just states it without any references or explanations. There's no evidence or reasoning provided to back up the claim. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or support given. Therefore, verifiability would also be 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out that the main idea isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. But it doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It just criticizes without providing actionable steps. Since the authors don't know what to do next, the review isn't helpful. It's more of a criticism without any constructive feedback. So, helpfulness would be 1 as well.\n\nOverall, the review is pointing out some issues but lacks in providing clear actions or evidence to support its points, making it not helpful for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that an ablation study is missing and suggests analyzing certain parameters. It's explicit about pointing out the missing study and provides specific suggestions, like analyzing how \u03b7 and \u03c4 affect performance. Since the actions are clear and direct, this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but maybe a bit vague on how exactly to implement the analysis.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 4 and mentions specific parameters (\u03b7 and \u03c4) in equation (7). It accurately points out the areas needing improvement without being too vague. So, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does identify the part of the paper but could be a bit clearer.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the missing ablation study and parameter analysis would cause confusion and extra experimentation. It provides some reasoning but could benefit from more concrete references or examples. So, this might be **3: Somewhat Verifiable** as it has some justification but isn't fully robust.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions about adding an ablation study and analyzing specific parameters. It's helpful but could be improved by providing more detailed guidance or context. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it gives meaningful feedback but isn't the most comprehensive.\n\nOverall, each aspect is clear but could use some refinement to be more actionable, grounded, verifiable, and helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper was hard to follow and mentions the experimental procedures and evaluations. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not explicit or implicit because there's no suggestion on how to improve. Therefore, it's unactionable, which is a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the paper being hard to follow but doesn't specify which part. It doesn't mention sections, tables, or figures. So, it's not grounded because it can't pinpoint the issue. It's a 1 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a judgment about the paper's clarity but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That's another 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve. So, it's not helpful at all, which is a 1.\n\nOverall, the review is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests looking into generalizing results to other models and includes an example for GPT-2. It's explicit about the action, which is good. The explicitness is clear, and the action is to include more analysis for GPT-2. Since the action is directly stated and provides a clear example, it's highly actionable. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific models like GPT-2 and different architectures. It accurately points out where the analysis should be added, which is a strong point. It doesn't just say \"other models\" but specifies, so this is fully grounded and specific. That should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a clear claim about generalizing results and supports it by suggesting adding analysis for GPT-2. It uses logical reasoning by providing an example. The evidence is sufficient, so it's fully verifiable. I'll rate this a 5 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is very helpful because it directly points out the need for generalization and provides a specific example. It guides the authors on exactly where to add more analysis. This is comprehensive and constructive, so it deserves a 5.\n\nOverall, each aspect is well addressed in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I remember that it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The review point says the authors need to show two graphs and address some concerns about performance improvement. It mentions whether the improvement is from network design or ImageNet's nature. This seems like a clear action, so it's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? It suggests showing graphs but doesn't specify how to create them or where to find data. So it's somewhat vague. I think this would be a 3 because it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. This is about how specific the review is regarding the paper's parts. The review mentions two specific graphs, which is good. It also talks about ImageNet's characteristics, which is a specific part of the dataset. It doesn't just say \"improve the paper\" but points to exact areas. So I'd rate this as 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, I need to check if the claims are supported. The review is making a judgment about why performance might improve and suggests looking into ImageNet's redundancies. It doesn't cite external references or logical reasoning beyond general statements. So it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. I think a 3 here makes sense.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is pointing out specific issues and giving a clear direction, which is helpful. It doesn't seem vague or too broad. It's actionable and constructive, so I'd rate this as 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be a bit more detailed.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything. The action is clear but not detailed, which is why it's a 3. The grounding is solid, so 5. Verifiability is there but not robust, so 3. Helpfulness is good but could improve with more specifics, so 4. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that using a volumetric representation isn't novel and mentions VolumeDeform [1]. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next or how to apply this information. So, it's not giving them actionable steps. That means it's not actionable at all, so I'll give it a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to VolumeDeform by citation, which is specific. It mentions a particular work, so the authors can identify where to look. But it doesn't explain what's wrong with their approach or how to fix it. So, it's grounded because it mentions a specific reference, but it's not specific in terms of addressing the issue. I think a 3 here because it's somewhat grounded but not fully specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that using volumetric grids isn't novel, referencing VolumeDeform. It doesn't provide evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It just states that it's not a novel idea without backing it up. So, it's not very verifiable. I'll rate it a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks strong justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that it's not a novel idea and cites another work. However, it doesn't provide clear guidance on how to proceed or what changes could be made. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, a 3 seems appropriate here as well.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated based on how well the review provides actionable steps, grounds the comments on specific parts, supports claims with evidence, and helps the authors improve their work.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The rock-paper-scissors example is clearly inspired by an example that appeared in many previous work. Please, cite the source appropriately.\" It's asking the authors to cite the source, which is an explicit action. So, the reviewer is telling them exactly what to do. Now, is this action clear? Yes, they know to cite the source. But is it concrete? Well, it doesn't specify how to do that, like which citation style or where to find the source. So, it's explicit but not very concrete. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions that the example is inspired by previous work but doesn't specify which part of the paper the example is referring to. It just says \"many previous work,\" which is pretty vague. The reviewer isn't pointing to a specific section or figure, so the grounding is weak. However, they do mention the source, which is helpful. But since they don't pin down exactly where the example is in the paper, it's not fully grounded. So, I'd rate this a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The reviewer is making a claim by stating that the example is inspired by previous work. They're asking the authors to cite the source, which is a claim that needs justification. Now, citing the source is a common practice, so it's supported by common knowledge. They're not providing external references, but it's a standard request. So, this is somewhat verifiable, but not fully. I'd give it a 3 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is asking the authors to cite the source, which is a clear and actionable suggestion. It's not vague; it's specific about what needs to be done. The reviewer is providing a direct instruction without being too broad or too narrow. This seems helpful because it guides the authors on what to do without overcomplicating it. So, I'd rate this a 4 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the specific points made in the review.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review says the innovations are limited and mentions the oracle expert's performance. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not actionable because there's no specific fix or improvement suggested. I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to the performance being limited by the oracle expert but doesn't specify which part of the paper that relates to. It's vague, so the authors don't know exactly where to focus their improvements. This is weak grounding, so I'll give it a 3 (Weakly Grounded and Specific).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the innovations are limited. It just states an opinion without supporting references or logical reasoning. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**.

So, it's not giving an explicit action. It's more of a statement of fact. Therefore, it's unactionable because authors don't know what to fix or how to improve.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about a drop in correlation without pointing to a specific part of the paper. It doesn't mention any sections, tables, or figures. So, the grounding is weak because it can't accurately identify where the issue is. It's not grounded in the paper's specific parts.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states a claim that correlation drops after short training but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: Since the comment doesn't specify what to do or why there's a drop in correlation, it's not helpful. The authors don't get actionable feedback, so it's not helpful at all.\n\nSo, all four aspects get a score of 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the derivation from Eqn. 3 to Eqn. 4 misses the temperature \u03c4 and suggests showing it rigorously or mentioning it in the paper. The action here is clear: the authors need to include \u03c4 in their derivation. However, the instruction is a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to show \u03c4 rigorously. So, it's explicit in pointing out the missing element but doesn't give detailed steps on how to fix it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Eqn. 3 and Eqn. 4 by number, which is a specific part of the paper. It also mentions \u03c4, which is a specific element in the equations. The comment is specific about what's missing and suggests addressing it, so it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to the relevant parts and clearly states what needs fixing.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the derivation is missing \u03c4. It suggests showing it rigorously or mentioning it. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for why including \u03c4 is necessary or how it affects the derivation. It's clear but lacks backing, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a specific issue and suggests a solution, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is quite vague\u2014just saying \"show it rigorously\" doesn't give much direction. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies a problem, but it doesn't provide enough guidance, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a citation to a standard work on differential privacy. That's a clear action. The reviewer is pointing out that the authors should include a reference, which is explicit. Now, is this action clear? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly what to do\u2014add a citation. There's no ambiguity here. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions adding a citation to a specific standard work. This is pretty specific because they're naming a particular reference. The comment isn't vague; it clearly points to a known work. So, the grounding is strong, and the specificity is high. I'd rate this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that adding a citation would be useful. They're suggesting it, which is a claim. Now, is this claim supported? Well, the reviewer is stating their opinion that adding a citation would help the reader. However, they don't provide any justification or reasoning for why this is necessary or beneficial. It's a suggestion without backing. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a claim, but no solid evidence to support it. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is suggesting adding a citation. This is clear and directly points to an improvement. It gives the authors a specific action to take. While it's straightforward, it might not cover all possible areas where the citation could be needed, but it's still helpful. So, a 4 seems appropriate because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring that each score reflects the clarity, specificity, justification, and overall value of the review point to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says the authors conducted experiments in various settings. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the comment mentions specific experiments but doesn't tell the authors what to change or improve. It just states that they did comprehensive experiments. So, it's not explicit or direct. Therefore, it's unactionable, which is a 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This is about how specific the review is regarding the paper's parts. The comment talks about experiments in various settings but doesn't specify which part of the paper or which sections it refers to. It's too vague, so grounding is weak. Hence, it's also a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the authors did experiments in various settings. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable, scoring a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review mentions the authors' experiments but doesn't provide any feedback on how to improve them or suggest any changes. It's just stating facts without actionable advice.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors have only taken the first step towards strategic settings. It mentions that the opponent doesn't behave strategically. The comment is pointing out a limitation but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. It's vague about how to improve. So, it's not explicit because it's not telling them exactly what to do. It's also not concrete because it doesn't provide actionable steps. Therefore, it's somewhere between 2 and 3 on the actionable scale. Since it's not giving clear instructions, I think it's a 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"strategic predictions\" and \"opponent doesn't behave strategically.\" It mentions the opponent not considering the other player, which is specific. However, it's a bit vague about what exactly needs to be addressed. It doesn't clearly state what part of the paper is problematic. So, it's grounded because it mentions a specific part, but it's not as clear as it could be. Therefore, I'd rate it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the opponent isn't strategic. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's an opinion without justification. So, it's not fully verifiable because there's no supporting data. Maybe it's somewhat verifiable, but since it lacks justification, I think it's a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't suggest how to improve. It's pointing out a problem without offering solutions. While it's helpful in identifying an issue, it doesn't help the authors fix it. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated based on how well the review point provides clear, specific, and justifiable feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the authors' approach is only applicable for small or medium problems. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do. It just states a limitation. So, there's no direct action or suggestion. That means it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to adjust their approach. So, I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the approach being applicable to small or medium problems. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is, so they don't know what to fix. Therefore, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed. So, this is also a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the approach isn't suitable for large problems. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just an opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing for the claim. That gives it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's just stating that the approach won't work for large problems. Without any actionable steps, it's not very helpful. So, it's a 2 (Barely Helpful) because it does identify an issue but lacks the necessary suggestions.\n\nOverall, the review is somewhat critical but lacks the necessary details to help the authors improve their work significantly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review says that the aggregation operation after \"Integration\" needs clarification. It also suggests providing more details in the main paper and acknowledging other architectures if they're referred to. \n\nFor actionability, it's important that the comment is explicit and gives a clear action. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper (the aggregation operation) and suggests what needs to be done (clarify and expand). That seems pretty explicit. Also, the action is concrete because it tells the authors exactly where to focus and what to do. So I think this is highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions the aggregation operation after \"Integration\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It just says \"the main paper\" and refers to other architectures without being precise. So the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. However, it does imply where to look, which is better than not specifying at all. So I'd rate this as weak grounding but with some specificity, maybe a 3.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment is making a judgment that the aggregation operation needs clarification and suggests improvements. But it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just stating an opinion without backing it up. So the verifiability is low. I think it's somewhat verifiable because it's a judgment, but without justification, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review points out a specific area that needs improvement and gives clear suggestions on what to do. It's helpful because it guides the authors on where to focus and what changes to make. However, it doesn't go into detail about how to clarify the operation or provide examples, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this a 4.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, the review is highly actionable, has weak grounding with some specificity, is somewhat verifiable, and is somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that if the figures don't show results for untrained networks, they should run experiments and add them. It also asks to clarify some points about random data and normalization. The comments are explicit about the actions needed, like adding experiments and clarifying details. Additionally, it provides clear instructions on where to add the data and examples in the appendix. So, this is explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific figures (like Fig 3c and Fig 3) and mentions tables. It also asks for clarification on specific aspects of the data. Since it's pointing to exact sections and elements, this is fully grounded. The specificity is high because it clearly states what needs to be addressed in those parts. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the experiments should be run and data added. It supports this by suggesting specific actions and providing examples in the appendix. However, the support is somewhat vague, like mentioning \"appendix\" without specifics. It's clear that the authors need to take these steps, but the justification isn't as strong as it could be. So, I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is clear about what needs to be done and provides actionable steps. It doesn't seem too vague but could be more detailed. It's somewhat helpful because it guides the authors on where to add data and clarifications. So, a 4 seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the task setup isn't described clearly. It mentions using EHR notes, whether current admission or previous ones, and how far away the outcomes are from the last note. The comment suggests the authors should clarify these aspects but doesn't specify exactly what changes to make. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but vague on how to fix it. That makes it **Explicit** but **Vague**, so it's a 4 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about EHR notes and the time gap but doesn't specify which parts of the paper or sections of the notes. It's too general, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly what needs to be addressed. This means it's **Weakly Grounded** because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or issue, and it's not specific about what needs fixing. So, grounding_specificity is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it suggests the authors need to clarify the task setup. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It just states the problem without backing it up with references or logical reasoning. So, it's **Unverifiable**, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a clear issue but doesn't offer much guidance on how to improve it. It's vague and doesn't give specific suggestions or examples. While it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully constructive. So, helpfulness is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that DMLCBO doesn't achieve the same convergence rate as SUSTAIN and MRBO because of a theoretical difference. It suggests the authors discuss this. Is this explicit? Yes, it tells them to explain the reason and difference. Is it concrete? It points out a specific result and asks for a discussion, so authors know exactly what to do. So, this should be highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to previous works by name (SUSTAIN[1] and MRBO[2]) and specific convergence rates. That's pretty specific. It doesn't just say \"previous works\" but gives exact references and metrics. So, this is fully grounded and specific, probably a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that DMLCBO doesn't achieve the same rate due to theoretical differences. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states an opinion. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. Maybe a 3 since it's somewhat specific but lacks justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review points out a specific weakness and suggests a discussion, which is helpful. It's clear and gives direction, so it's mostly helpful. Maybe a 4 because it could be more detailed, but it's still useful.\n\nI think that's a solid evaluation.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says, \"The approach section is missing in the main paper. The reviewer did go through the 'parallelization descriptions' in the supplementary material but the supplementary should be used more like additional information and not as an extension to the paper as it is.\" \n\nHmm, so the reviewer is pointing out that the main paper lacks an approach section and mentions that they checked the supplementary material. They suggest that the supplementary should be more of additional info rather than an extension. Now, is this actionable? Well, the reviewer is making a clear suggestion about the supplementary material, but they don't specify exactly what needs to be done. They just say the supplementary should be used differently. So, it's an implicit action, which might be a bit vague. But since they do suggest a change, I think it's actionable. Maybe a 4 or 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the supplementary material but doesn't specify exactly which part or how it should be used. They mention \"the supplementary should be used more like additional information,\" which is a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because they don't pinpoint the issue. They do mention the supplementary, but it's not very specific about what needs fixing. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the supplementary should be more additional info. But there's no supporting evidence or references here. It's just a suggestion without backing. So, it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer suggests the supplementary should be used differently but doesn't provide specific details on how or why. They also mention increasing their score from 3 to 5, which shows they found it helpful enough to improve their score. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Maybe a 4.\n\nWait, but the actionability was a bit unclear. Since they suggest a change but don't specify how, maybe it's borderline. But I think it's still actionable because they're pointing out a clear issue. So, maybe 5 for actionability. Grounding is weakly grounded but specific about the supplementary, so maybe 4. Verifiability is definitely unverifiable because there's no justification. Helpfulness is somewhat helpful because they did find it useful enough to adjust their score, so maybe 4.\n\nI'm a bit confused about grounding. If they mention the supplementary but don't specify how, is it weakly grounded? Or is it fully grounded because they know where to look? Maybe it's weakly grounded because they can't confidently identify the exact issue beyond the supplementary. So, 3.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 5, grounding 3, verifiability X, helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says that competing dynamic-pruning methods are out-of-date and suggests including more recent works. It also mentions that only small scale datasets were used and recommends including results from large scale datasets like ImageNet. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The review does suggest including more recent works and larger datasets, which is explicit. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement this, like which new methods to include or how to analyze the larger datasets. So, it's not fully actionable because the actions aren't detailed. That would probably be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review talks about including more recent works and larger datasets but doesn't specify exactly which parts of the paper or which sections to focus on. It mentions \"small scale datasets\" and \"ImageNet,\" which are specific, but it's still a bit vague. So, I think it's grounded because it refers to specific parts of the paper, but not fully. Maybe a 3 here as well.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The review suggests including more recent works and larger datasets. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up these claims. It's just a suggestion without justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary support. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does point out areas for improvement, like including more recent methods and larger datasets. It gives clear suggestions, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into detail about how to implement these changes or provide examples. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the paper argues about finding flat minima but lacks analysis on flatness. It points out that minimizing the averaged loss doesn't ensure flatness and suggests adding analysis on the losses of noise-injected models. The comment is explicit about the action needed: adding analysis. It also concretely explains what needs to be done, which is adding this analysis. So, it's both explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5 because it's clear and direct.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to the paper by mentioning Eq (3) and the loss used. It accurately points out a specific part of the paper where the issue lies. The specificity is good because it clearly states what needs to be addressed without being vague. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests adding analysis but doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning. It just states that the current loss doesn't ensure flatness and that more analysis is needed. While it's somewhat justified, there's no concrete evidence or examples from external sources. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which would be a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is clear about the issue and provides a specific suggestion. It guides the authors on exactly what to do without being vague. The feedback is actionable and directly addresses the problem, making it highly helpful. So, this should be a 5.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. The review is explicit and concrete in actionable terms, accurately refers to specific parts of the paper, provides some justification but lacks external references, and is very helpful for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"The text inside the figure and the labels are too small to read without zooming. This text should be roughly the same size as the manuscript text.\" It explicitly tells the authors to make the text the same size as the manuscript. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. Also, it's very specific about what needs to be done. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions the figure and labels, which are specific parts of the paper. It doesn't just say \"the figure\" but specifies \"the text inside the figure and the labels.\" It also suggests a solution, which makes it grounded. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the text is too small and suggesting a change. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is a problem or how it affects the overall paper. It's just a suggestion without backing, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does identify an issue and provides a suggestion, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague about why this is a problem and doesn't offer much depth. It could be more helpful if it explained how this affects the manuscript or provided more context.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment suggests improving the model's presentation and adding diagrams. It's explicit about the actions, like replacing text with notation and adding diagrams. But does it give clear instructions on how to do that? It says \"replace some of the natural language description with notation\" but doesn't specify exactly what notation or how to implement it. So, it's explicit about what needs to be done but not very detailed. I think this is **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's clear what to do but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about section 4 and mentions adding diagrams. It's pretty specific about where to make changes. It doesn't mention external references or other sections, but it's clear which part is being addressed. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting improvements but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning why these changes are necessary.

So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but not enough.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear about what needs to be done and provides specific suggestions.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Symbols are a little bit complicated and takes a lot of time to understand.\" The definition for actionability is how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. It needs to tell the author exactly what to do. \n\nIn this case, the reviewer mentions that symbols are complicated and time-consuming. It's a statement, but it doesn't specify what the author should do. They don't suggest any changes or improvements, just an observation. So, it's not giving a clear action. That would make it **unactionable**, which is a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper. The reviewer talks about symbols being complicated, but they don't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be done. They just say it's complicated and time-consuming without pointing to a specific section or issue. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint the exact area. This would also be a **1**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a statement about symbols being complicated. There's no claim here, just a description. Since there's no justification or evidence provided, it's not verifiable. So, it's an **X**, but since the instruction says to assign a number, I think it's still a **1** because it's not verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out an issue but doesn't suggest any fixes or improvements. It's just stating that symbols are complicated. Without any actionable steps, it's not very helpful. So, it's a **2** because it's barely helpful\u2014there's some identification of a problem, but no solutions.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is either unhelpful or only slightly helpful, so the scores are 1 for actionability, 1 for grounding, 1 for verifiability, and 2 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

This is an explicit action, so it's clear what needs to be done. However, it doesn't specify how to make it more detailed, like adding examples or explanations. So, it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete details. That would rate it a 3.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the comment refers to \"the introduction to orthogonality in Part 2\" which is specific. It doesn't just say \"introduction could be better\"; it points to a specific section. So, it's fully grounded because it clearly identifies the part of the paper being discussed. That gives it a 3.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the introduction needs more detail. However, there's no justification or support provided. It's just a statement without backing, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment suggests improving the introduction but doesn't specify how. It's clear that the authors need to make changes, but without direction, it's somewhat helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the two methods are independent and have little connection. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving any specific actions or suggestions. That means it's not actionable at all. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the methods but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the part being discussed. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim about the methods being independent. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. There's no reference to external work or logical reasoning to support it. So, it's not verifiable. That gives it a 1 in verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a weakness in the methods but doesn't suggest any improvements or actions. It's vague and lacks clarity.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that similar analyses exist in prior works and cites specific papers. It doesn't provide any specific actions or suggestions for improvement. So, it's not giving the authors any clear steps to follow. That means it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about prior works and specific citations, but it doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's more of a general statement rather than pinpointing an issue. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't accurately point to the specific section or issue. I'll give it a 1 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review does cite specific papers, which adds some support. However, the claims made are quite general and don't provide detailed reasoning or references. The verifiability isn't fully supported, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I think a 3 is appropriate here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out that prior work exists and cites some sources, which could be helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't offer concrete suggestions for improvement. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. A 3 seems right for helpfulness as well.\n\nOverall, the review lacks explicit actions and specific guidance, so it's not very helpful or grounded. The citations are there, but they don't add much depth or clarity.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

However, it does not provide concrete guidance on how to improve the method for low bitrates. The suggestion to discuss a related work is vague and lacks specific actionable steps. Therefore, it is **Somewhat Actionable** (3).  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   The review mentions a specific reference (Guo Lu, et al., 2020) and refers to a related work. It also clearly states the comparison intended (BD-rate at low bitrates). This provides strong grounding as it identifies the specific aspect of the paper being discussed and supports it with relevant literature. Hence, it is **Fully Grounded and Specific** (5).  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   The claim about the related work is supported by a specific reference. The reasoning is clear, and the evidence is provided through the mention of the paper. This makes the claim verifiable. It is **Somewhat Verifiable** (3) because while the evidence is present, it could be more detailed.  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   The review provides some useful information about the method's performance and suggests a relevant related work.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that there's an insufficient ablation study on \u03b1 and suggests providing more values like 1e-2 and 1e-3. It seems like the reviewer is giving a clear direction for the author to improve their work by adding more specific values. The action is explicit\u2014suggesting more values\u2014and it's concrete because it tells the author exactly what to do. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer points out that \u03b1 is only set to 1e-4, 1e-1, and 5e-1. This is specific because they're naming exact values and sections where the issue occurs. The comment doesn't make any vague generalizations, so the grounding is solid. Therefore, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that an ablation study with more values is needed. While this is a suggestion, it's based on common knowledge about the importance of thorough ablation studies. There's logical reasoning but no external references or specific examples, so it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe a bit more could be added for clarity, but it's still verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides a clear recommendation without being too vague. It tells the author exactly what to do and why it's important. This is helpful because it guides the author towards improving their work. It's not the most detailed, but it's sufficient to be considered highly helpful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect seems to be at a high level, especially actionability and grounding. Verifiability is good but not perfect, and helpfulness is solid.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point asks about the number of topics, how topic-word parameters were obtained, the size of the AG news dataset, and the main paper's description of train/test documents and vocabulary size. These are specific questions, but they don't provide explicit instructions on what changes the authors should make. The comments are more about gathering information rather than suggesting concrete edits. So, this is more of a factual statement without clear actions. I think this is **1: Unactionable** because the authors don't know what to do next.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific aspects of the dataset (number of topics, parameters, dataset size). It mentions the main paper's description, which the authors can refer to. This shows that the comments are grounded because they accurately pinpoint the sections of the paper being discussed. The specificity is good because it clearly states what needs to be addressed. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review point is asking factual questions about the dataset. There's no claim or suggestion being made; it's just information. Since there's no claim, it doesn't require verification. Therefore, this is **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review point provides some useful information but doesn't offer actionable suggestions. It's more about gathering data rather than guiding improvements. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful** because it does offer some value, just not enough to be highly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 1\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: X\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions training a discriminator on generated data to confirm the model's claim. It also points out that this is different from Figure 4 because of co-adaptation. I think this is an explicit action because it tells the authors exactly what to do. But is it concrete? It suggests a specific method (using Figure 1 as a reference) and explains the difference with Figure 4. So, it's not vague. I'd say this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while it's clear, it could be more detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 1 and Figure 4. It mentions specific parts of the paper, which shows that the authors can pinpoint where the issue lies. It also clearly explains the difference, so it's specific. I don't see any weakness in grounding here. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a claim that training the discriminator is needed and supports it by mentioning co-adaptation and referencing figures. It uses logical reasoning and references existing knowledge, so it's well-supported. I think this is **4: Mostly Verifiable** because it's thorough but maybe a bit lengthy.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review gives a clear suggestion on how to confirm the model's claim and points out a specific difference in the figures. It's actionable and informative, so it should be **4: Mostly Helpful**. It doesn't go into too much detail but covers the essentials needed for improvement.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding details to the Related Work section, specifically mentioning several methods and mechanisms. It also provides references, which makes the suggestions explicit. The references are concrete, so the authors know exactly where to look. This seems highly actionable because it gives clear directions on what to add and where to find the information. So, I'd rate this as 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific methods like sparse-attention mechanisms and segmentation-based approaches, along with their references. This clearly points to specific parts of the paper, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where to make changes. The mention of references also implies a deeper understanding of existing literature, which is good. Therefore, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides specific references to existing works. While it's a bit lengthy, each reference is clear and points to established methods. This means the claims are well-supported, making it verifiable. It's thorough enough to be considered fully verifiable, so I'll give it a 4, but maybe it could be a 5 if it was even more detailed. Hmm, maybe 4 is okay.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is quite detailed, suggesting multiple specific areas to improve the Related Work section. It provides clear references, which is helpful for the authors to follow up. The suggestions are actionable and cover several points, which makes it highly helpful. So, I'll rate this as 5.\n\nOverall, the review point is comprehensive and provides clear guidance, making it very helpful for the authors. It's also well-supported and explicitly suggests changes, so it's highly actionable and grounded. The references are specific, so it's fully verifiable. Everything seems to be on the higher end, so all scores should be 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving them actionable steps. That means it's not actionable at all. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions existing frameworks but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing or what needs to be changed. It's too vague about the specific issue. So, it's not fully grounded. I think a 3 here because it's not clearly pointing out the specific part but also not weak grounding.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the algorithm isn't novel but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just claims that existing frameworks are extended. Without supporting reasoning or references, it's not verifiable. So, I'd give it a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a weakness but doesn't suggest any improvements or actions. It's vague and doesn't help the authors move forward.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the proposed solution is an incremental step considering Guzman's work. It also adds minor suggestions. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment does state an action by mentioning Guzman's work, which is explicit. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done beyond citing Guzman. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear that Guzman's work is relevant, but the exact action isn't detailed. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about considering Guzman's work but doesn't specify which part of the paper or exactly what needs to be addressed. It's a bit vague. Grounding is about how specific the comment is about the paper. Since it doesn't pinpoint a specific section or detail, it's not fully grounded. But it's not so weak that it's not grounded at all either. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions Guzman's work but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why Guzman's approach is relevant or better. It just states that the solution is incremental. There's no justification or references, so it's not verifiable. I'd rate this as 1 because it lacks any supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some suggestions but they're quite vague. It mentions considering Guzman's work and adds minor suggestions, but without specifics. This isn't very helpful because the authors don't know exactly what to do.

The reviewer doesn't provide any actionable steps or solutions. So, this is more of a comment pointing out a problem without giving clear directions on how to fix it. That makes it **unactionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about time complexity and reply buffers but doesn't reference any specific part of the paper. It's too vague. The reviewer doesn't mention sections, tables, figures, or unique aspects of the paper. So, it's not grounded because it can't be confidently tied to a specific part of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states a claim that increasing the reply buffer will cause high time complexity. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no logical reasoning or external sources to support this claim. It's just a statement without backing, so it's **unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue but doesn't offer any solutions or guidance. It's just a critique without actionable advice. Therefore, it's not helpful at all because the authors won't know how to address the problem.\n\nSo, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because they're either unactionable, not grounded, unverifiable, or not helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests the authors should compare their framework with another method that defends against multiple attacks. It's an explicit action, so that's good. But the comment is vague because it doesn't specify how to implement this comparison or what results to present. It feels like the authors need to figure out how to apply this themselves. So, it's not fully actionable because the action isn't detailed enough. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions comparing with another method but doesn't clearly identify which specific part of the paper this comparison relates to. It's a bit vague about the exact section or figure. So, the grounding isn't very strong because it's not pinpointing the exact issue. I think a 3 here makes sense.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding a comparison but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a suggestion without justification. So, it's not very verifiable because there's no backing to support the claim. Maybe a 3 here as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does suggest an improvement the authors could make by adding a comparison. It's clear and provides a direction for the authors. While it's not the most detailed, it's still helpful enough to guide them.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking the authors to define the bounds for \u03c4_i^l. Is this an explicit action? It seems like the reviewer is suggesting a task, but it's a bit vague. The authors need to figure out what the bounds are, which means they have to infer the action. So, it's not a direct instruction but requires them to determine the bounds themselves. That makes it somewhat actionable because they know what to do, but it's not very specific on how to do it. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out that \u03c4_i^l is important for understanding the time-warp function. They're not explicitly naming a section or figure, but they're referring to a concept that's part of the paper. This is a weak ground because they're making an educated guess about where the issue lies. They aren't pinning it down to a specific part, so it's not fully grounded. However, they are specific in what they're asking about, so it's somewhat grounded. I'll give this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion to define bounds, which is a claim. But there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. The reviewer isn't explaining why defining bounds is important or how it relates to the time-warp function. It's just a directive without any backing, so it's unverifiable. The label here is X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking for a definition of bounds, which is a helpful suggestion. It's pointing out a necessary step without being too vague. However, it's not offering a lot of guidance beyond the action itself. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions, considering how explicit, grounded, verifiable, and helpful the comment is.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the efficiency of pairwise matching is low. It mentions that this makes it difficult to be used in practical systems. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do next. In this case, the reviewer suggests improving efficiency, but they don't specify how. They don't tell the authors what changes to make or how to implement those changes. So, it's not explicit. It's more of a statement pointing out a problem without giving actionable steps. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it implies an action but doesn't detail it. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about whether the review clearly references a specific part of the paper. The review doesn't mention any specific section, table, or figure. It just states a general issue with efficiency. Since there's no specific part of the paper addressed, it's not grounded. It's more of a broad comment without pinpointing where the problem lies. So, grounding_specificity would also be 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the efficiency is low, which is a subjective opinion. Verifiability requires that claims be supported by evidence. Here, the reviewer doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back up their claim. It's just an opinion without justification. Therefore, it's unverifiable, scoring 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't suggest specific improvements or how to address it. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable advice. While it identifies an issue, it doesn't help the authors know what to do next. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Hence, it's a 2 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The first sentence of the abstract needs to be re-written.\" That's pretty clear. It tells the author exactly what to do\u2014rewriting the first sentence. But does it give specifics on how to do it? Not really. It just says \"re-write,\" which is a bit vague. So, it's not completely explicit because it doesn't specify what changes to make. But it's definitely an action the author can take. So, I think this is **actionable** but maybe not fully explicit. Looking at the scale, 3 is somewhat actionable because it's explicit but vague on how to implement it. Wait, but the initial thought was 5 because it's clear what needs to be done. Hmm, maybe I should reconsider. Since it's vague on the specifics, it's more like 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment doesn't mention anything specific about the abstract. It just says the first sentence needs re-writing. So, the author has to guess which part that is. That's not grounded because it's not pointing to a specific section or element. Therefore, it's **not grounded**. On the scale, 1 is not grounded, so that's a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the first sentence needs re-writing. But there's no justification or reasoning provided. It's just a statement without any backing. So, it's not verifiable. Looking at the scale, 1 is unverifiable, so that's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment tells the author what to do but doesn't provide any specific advice on how to re-write the sentence. It's vague and doesn't offer concrete suggestions. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. On the scale, 3 is somewhat helpful, but since it's better than 2, maybe 4? Wait, the initial thought was 4 because it's helpful but lacks specifics. So, 4 seems right.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, actionability was 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4. But upon re-evaluating, I think actionability should be 3 because it's explicit but vague. Grounding is definitely 1. Verifiability is 1. Helpfulness is 4. So, the initial evaluation might have been too high on actionability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The method seems more involved that it needs to be.\" Hmm, that's a bit vague. It mentions that the method is more involved than necessary but doesn't specify what needs to be done. So, the reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a clear action. It doesn't tell the authors what to change or how to fix it. That sounds like it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the method being more involved than necessary. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper or method is the issue. It's too general. The authors can't pinpoint exactly where the problem lies because the comment doesn't reference any specific section, table, or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the method is more involved than necessary. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just an opinion without any backing. So, the claim isn't supported by anything, making it unverifiable. Hence, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does identify that the method is too involved, which is helpful. However, it doesn't specify what needs to be done or how to simplify it. It's vague, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully constructive. Therefore, helpfulness is 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect is scored as follows: actionability 1, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Adding a method on the top of other methods to improve transferability is good but cannot be considered a significant contribution.\" It suggests an action, which is adding a method, but it's vague about how to do it. It doesn't provide specific steps or examples, so it's not explicit. Since the action is vague, it's not actionable. So, this should be labeled as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about adding a method but doesn't specify where or how. It doesn't mention any particular part of the paper, so it's not grounded. There's no specific reference to a section or method, so it's weakly grounded or not grounded at all. I'll give it a 1 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions that adding a method isn't a significant contribution but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for that claim. It's just a statement without supporting reasons, so it's unverifiable. That means the verifiability label is 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does point out a potential weakness by suggesting that adding a method isn't significant, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide much guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using s_n instead of s_t and asks for asymptotic performance and average return results with more environment steps. It also links to a GitHub repository. The action is clear: replace s_t with s_n and ask for specific data. The instructions are explicit, so this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but doesn't give exact steps on how to compute s_n or where to find the data.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions replacing s_t with s_n, which is specific, and references a GitHub link, which is a clear reference. It doesn't just say \"more env steps\" but specifies average return results. So this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to the part and provides clear details.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any justification or evidence. It doesn't explain why s_n is better or how the asymptotic performance would help. So it's **X: No Claim** because there's no supporting reasoning or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and suggests specific changes, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide much detail on how to compute s_n or where to find the data, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Therefore, it should be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

While the comment is explicit about the need for clarification, it's vague on what exactly needs to be done. The authors aren't given a specific action, like rewriting a section or adding a figure, so it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete steps.\n\n**Grounding_specificity (Label: 5):**\nThe comment refers to the (L0,L1)-smoothness condition and mentions Zhang et al. as a reference. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being discussed and provides a specific reason for the suggestion, making it fully grounded and specific.\n\n**Verifiability (Label: 3):**\nThe claim here is that there are challenges in analyzing Adam under (L0,L1)-smoothness, and that explaining these challenges, especially compared to Zhang et al., is necessary. The comment doesn't provide evidence or references to support this claim, so it's somewhat verifiable but lacks sufficient justification.\n\n**Helpfulness (Label: 4):**\nThe review points out a specific area for improvement and suggests a comparison with another work, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide detailed guidance or evidence, so it's mostly helpful but could be improved by offering more concrete suggestions.\n\nOverall, the review is clear in its intent but could be more specific and detailed to be fully actionable and verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that most person re-ID methods build on pedestrian detectors and mentions both two-step and end-to-end methods. It doesn't specify what the author should do next, like suggesting improvements or pointing out specific issues. So, it's not actionable because there's no clear direction for the author to follow. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about pedestrian detectors and mentions two methods but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague about the exact issue. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper being discussed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that most methods build on pedestrian detectors and mentions two approaches. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references to support why this is the case. There's no logical reasoning or evidence backing up the claim, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some information about existing methods but doesn't provide actionable feedback or suggestions for improvement. It's more of a factual statement without addressing how it helps the author enhance their work. So, it's not very helpful.\n\nOverall, the review point doesn't meet the criteria for any of the aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review suggests adding a first sentence to introduce Section 3.2. That's pretty clear. The action is explicit because it tells the author exactly what to do: add a sentence. It doesn't require them to figure out where to add it or what to write, so that's direct. Also, the action is concrete because it specifies exactly what needs to be done\u2014write a sentence. So this should be highly actionable. I think that's a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions adding a sentence to introduce the section but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly to write. It's vague about the content. So the author can't confidently pinpoint the exact section or the details needed. That means it's not fully grounded. Since it's vague, it doesn't clearly identify the issue, so I'd rate this as 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is just suggesting adding a sentence without any justification or evidence. There's no explanation of why this is necessary or any references to support it. So it's not verifiable at all. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The suggestion is clear and provides a specific action for the author. It helps them understand what to do without being vague. While it doesn't go into detail about what the sentence should say, it's still actionable and constructive. So I think this is mostly helpful, which would be a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point explains how uncertainty is defined, linking it to the posterior distribution and providing a detailed explanation of the epistemic model and how data updates beliefs. It gives clear instructions on how to improve the definition. This seems very explicit and concrete, so I think it's highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the posterior distribution but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a bit vague in terms of pinpointing a specific section or figure. However, it does clearly explain what needs to be addressed, so it's grounded but not fully specific. I'm leaning towards a 4 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides a logical explanation of how uncertainty is defined and how the posterior distribution works. It references common knowledge about Bayesian models and updating beliefs with data. This is thorough and supports the claim well, so I'll rate it a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is very clear and provides actionable suggestions. It helps the authors understand exactly how to improve their definition. Even though it's a bit lengthy, it's comprehensive and useful. I'll give it a 5.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the scores are 5, 4, 4, and 5 respectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the abstention process uses a prediction probability threshold. It asks how this differs from a decision threshold used by models and requests clarification. The action here is clear: authors need to clarify the difference. The comment is explicit about the need for clarification, so that's good. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to do the clarification, like whether they should compare model thresholds or provide examples. So it's somewhat actionable but not fully concrete. I'd rate this as 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about a prediction probability threshold and a decision threshold. It doesn't explicitly mention specific parts of the paper, like certain sections or tables. It's a bit vague about what exactly is being discussed. So the grounding isn't very strong. I think this is a 3 because it partially identifies the area but isn't as precise.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is asking for clarification, which is a claim. But there's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. It just poses a question without backing it up. So it's not verifiable at all. I'll give this an X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review asks for clarification, which is helpful because it guides the authors to improve their work. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide specific directions. So while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says that the analysis from line 128 to 149 isn't convincing enough. It mentions that the GS-P-50 model has a smaller class selectivity score, implying ResNet-50 learns more class-specific features. The authors then hypothesize that additional context could reduce dependency. \n\nHmm, so the review is pointing out an observation and a hypothesis. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They might need to consider adding context or more analysis. Since the action isn't directly told, it's more implicit. Also, the explanation is a bit vague about how to implement this. So, it's somewhere between explicit and implicit. I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it gives a direction but doesn't specify exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to lines 128-149 and Figure 3, but it doesn't explicitly name the part of the paper being discussed. It mentions class selectivity scores and ResNet-50, which are general concepts. The grounding here is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or element. However, it does imply which part is being analyzed, so maybe it's considered grounded. I'm leaning towards **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does specify what's being discussed but doesn't clearly identify the exact part.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the analysis isn't convincing enough. It supports this by stating that GS-P-50 has smaller class selectivity and that adding context could help. The reasoning is logical, and they reference external papers, which adds credibility. So, it's thoroughly supported. I'd rate this as **5: Fully Verifiable** because the claims are well-justified with clear reasoning and references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review points out a weakness and suggests an improvement area. It gives a clear reason why the observation might indicate better representation. The references are provided, which adds value. However, it's not super detailed, so while it's helpful, it could be expanded. I think this is **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and constructive but could be more comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, justification, and guidance provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that important experimental details are missing and that the Appendix lacks explanations. It suggests moving PCA details to the main text. Now, is this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors where to move the details. Is it concrete? It specifies where to move them, so authors know exactly what to do. So, this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific sections (Figures 3,7,8) and mentions the Appendix. This is explicit, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issues are. It's also specific about what needs to be addressed. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that details are missing and suggesting a solution. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond stating the issue. So, it's somewhat justified but lacks depth. Maybe a **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issues and suggests a solution. It's actionable and provides direction, so it's helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors perform ablation experiments comparing their method with TubeR. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. But the instructions say to be explicit vs. implicit. Since it's a direct action, I think it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The review tells them exactly what to do: compare with a specific method and measure parameters and GFLOPs. That's concrete because they know exactly how to apply it. So, it should be 5 for actionability. Wait, but the initial output says 3. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps the action is explicit but the grounding isn't clear yet. Maybe I'll revisit that after looking at the other aspects.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions comparing with TubeR, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be measured. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The specificity is also low because it doesn't clearly detail what needs to be addressed. So, this should be a lower score, maybe 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim suggesting the authors perform experiments. But there's no supporting evidence or justification. It's just a statement without backing. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review tells the authors what to do but doesn't explain why or how it helps. It's vague and lacks depth. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That would be a 3.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought actionability was 5. Maybe I was wrong. The review is explicit about the action but doesn't provide concrete details on how to implement it. It just says to compare with another method. So, it's explicit but not fully actionable because it lacks specifics on how to perform the experiments. Therefore, it's borderline actionable, which is a 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together: actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The review is asking the authors to define the dashed lines in specific figures. It's giving a clear action, so that's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? Not really. They might need to look at the figures and figure out what the dashed lines represent. So it's explicit but not very detailed on how to implement the action. That would be a 3 for actionable.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment is pointing to specific figures, which is good. It's not just a vague comment about the paper but specifically about parts of it. So that's fully grounded. But does it specify what needs to be done? It says \"define the dashed lines,\" which is a bit vague. It doesn't tell them what exactly to write or how to interpret the lines. So maybe it's weakly specific. But since it does point to the figures, I think it's at least grounded. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is asking for definitions of dashed lines in figures. There's no claim being made here; it's just a request for clarification. So it's a normal statement without any supporting evidence. Therefore, it's unverifiable, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is asking for definitions of specific elements in figures. It's helpful in that it's pointing out areas the authors might need to clarify, but it's quite vague. It doesn't provide much direction on how to define the dashed lines or what information to include. So it's somewhat helpful but not very detailed. Maybe a 2.\n\nWait, but the user's initial evaluation was all 1s except grounding specificity which was 3. I think I agree with that. The comment is clear in pointing to specific figures, so grounding is 3. The rest are either not claims or vague, so helpfulness is 1, verifiability is 1, and actionability is 3. I think that's accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Since the results are not comparable to the existing methods, there seems not too much significance for the proposed methods.\" The key here is whether this provides clear actions for the authors. It mentions an issue but doesn't suggest specific changes. It's more of a critique without actionable steps. So, it's not explicit or concrete. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the results not being comparable. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper or results it's referring to. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue lies. This means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the results aren't comparable. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. There's no logical reasoning or references to support why the results aren't significant. So, it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors move forward. So, it's only barely helpful, scoring a 2.\n\nOverall, the review lacks in providing clear actions, specific references, justifications, and helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper is incremental and lacks technical substance, adding a new loss to [31]. It doesn't specify what needs to be done or how to improve it. So, it's not giving the authors clear actions to take. That means it's **unactionable**, so a score of 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions a new loss to [31], which is specific. However, it doesn't explain why this is a problem or what needs to be done. The authors still have to figure out what's wrong on their own. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the issue. Maybe a score of 1 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that the paper is incremental and lacks technical substance. But it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. There's no reference to external works or logical reasoning, so it's not verifiable. That gives it a score of 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't offer specific suggestions or explain why it's an issue. The authors still have to determine what needs to be done.

It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do or how to improve their work. So, it's not giving clear actions. I think this is **1: Unactionable** because there's no specific suggestion on how to proceed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to the paper's own statement about alternatives, but it doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It's a bit vague, so I'd say it's **1: Not Grounded** because it doesn't clearly identify where the issue is.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions that combining attention with linear mechanisms isn't novel and that alternatives exist. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. Without supporting evidence, it's hard to verify the claim. So, this is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**.

It seems that the main novelty reflected in the scheme or procedure novelty.\" Hmm, so it's pointing out that technical details are lacking and mentions the novelty of the scheme or procedure. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It says the authors need to improve technical details and mention the novelty, but it doesn't specify how or where. So, it's not giving explicit actions. That would make it **1: Unactionable** because the authors don't know what steps to take.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about technical details and formulations being limited and mentions the novelty of the scheme or procedure. But does it clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to? It's a bit vague. It doesn't specify a section or a particular aspect, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issues are. Therefore, it's **1: Not Grounded** because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part being addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that technical details are limited and that there's a novelty in the scheme or procedure. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating observations without supporting evidence. So, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing for the claims made.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out issues but doesn't provide specific suggestions or guidance on how to improve. It's vague and doesn't offer actionable steps.

The review mentions including a plot with specific axes, which clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed. It's well-grounded because it points to a specific section. It also specifies what needs to be done, which adds clarity. So, this should be a 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests including a plot comparing sparsity and performance.

I'll give it a 1 because it lacks any supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is clear about suggesting a plot to compare methods. It provides a specific recommendation without being overly vague. This should be helpful because it guides the authors to improve their work.

So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like Figure 1 and the appendix, which clearly identifies where the data examples and model details should be. It also specifies what needs to be explained about the data types. This strong grounding makes it clear which part of the paper is being addressed, so I'd rate this as fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides clear instructions but doesn't support them with evidence or references. It just asks the authors to do something, which is a claim, but without any backing.

It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is showing performance. So, this seems like it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the specific part and what's needed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why shift=0 is better or how the performance comparison will be done. It just suggests it. So, there's no supporting reasoning or references, making it unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest improvements but lacks details. It tells the authors what to do but doesn't explain why or how, which makes it somewhat helpful. It gives a direction but doesn't fully empower the authors with actionable steps.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, the scores are:\n- Actionability: Somewhat Actionable (3)\n- Grounding Specificity: Fully Grounded and Specific (5)\n- Verifiability: Unverifiable (1)\n- Helpfulness: Somewhat Helpful (3)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests considering whether one IN is enough instead of multiple. It's explicit about the action, which is good. But it's vague on how to implement this, like not specifying how to test or what metrics to use. So it's not fully actionable because the method isn't detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable,\" so the label is 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific part of the model, the INs, so it's grounded. It also clearly states what's being questioned, which is good. There's no mention of external work, so it's not under-specific. Therefore, it's \"Fully Grounded and Specific,\" giving it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just asks a question without supporting why the added complexity matters or how to test it. So there's no claim with supporting evidence, making it \"No Claim\" with an X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest an improvement area by questioning the design choice. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or reasoning, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That would be a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the opponent doesn't maximize the multi-agent payoff because they focus on classical SE and AE. It suggests improvements but doesn't specify exactly what changes the authors should make. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but vague on how to fix it. That makes it borderline actionable because it does hint at an action but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the opponent maximizing classical SE and AE, which is specific. It doesn't just say \"the opponent isn't maximizing something\" but gives examples of what they are maximizing. So, this is fully grounded because it clearly points to specific parts of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the opponent maximizes classical SE and AE, which is a claim. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support this; it's just a factual statement. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it mentions specific elements but lacks justification or evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some insight into why the opponent's approach is different but doesn't provide clear actionable steps for the authors. It's helpful in pointing out an issue but doesn't guide how to improve. So, it's somewhat helpful because it gives a partial improvement direction.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the review point's content.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that artificial networks using ASAP don't resemble biological networks except for the weight transport issue. It also says the authors aren't held accountable. I think the comment is pointing out a problem but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. It's more of a criticism without actionable steps. So, it's not fully actionable because there's no clear direction for improvement. Maybe it's a bit vague, so I'd rate it as 1 for unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about artificial networks and biological networks, specifically mentioning weight transport. It does identify a specific part of the paper, so that's good. However, it's a bit vague about what needs to be done. It doesn't clearly specify how to improve the model or what changes are necessary. So, it's grounded but not fully specific. I think a 3 here makes sense.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that artificial networks don't resemble biological ones except for the weight transport problem. It mentions this as a fact without providing evidence or justification. There's no reference to external studies or logical reasoning to support why this is an issue. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing for the claim. I'll give it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a flaw but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or improvements. It's more of a critique without actionable advice. The authors aren't guided on how to fix the issue, so it's not very helpful. I'd rate this a 2 because it's barely helpful, providing some insight but lacking in depth or guidance.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

It also asks the authors to discuss implications for low-rank matrix factorization. While the action is clear\u2014asking for a discussion of implications\u2014the instruction is somewhat vague. The authors might need more guidance on how to approach this discussion, making it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit.\n\n**Grounding_specificity (Label: 5):**\nThe reviewer specifically refers to low-rank matrix factorization, which is a clear and precise part of the paper. They also ask about implications, which is a specific area within that topic. This strong reference shows clear grounding, as the reviewer is pointing to a specific part of the work and what needs improvement there.\n\n**Verifiability (Label: 3):**\nThe reviewer makes a claim that the motivation is unnecessary and suggests discussing implications. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for these claims. The reasoning is vague, and there's no reference to external works or logical arguments to back it up. This makes the claim somewhat verifiable but lacking sufficient support.\n\n**Helpfulness (Label: 3):**\nThe review provides a clear point about unnecessary motivation and requests a discussion on implications. However, it lacks depth by not explaining why the motivation is unnecessary or how discussing implications would benefit the paper. The suggestions are good but could be expanded to make the feedback more comprehensive and helpful for the authors.\n\nOverall, the review is clear and specific but could be more detailed to fully meet the criteria for higher scores in all aspects.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper is incremental and compares it to [31]. It mentions the authors adapted an architecture for a multi-person case, producing heatmaps. But it doesn't tell the authors what to do next or how to improve. It's more of a critique without actionable steps. So, it's not explicit or vague. I think this is **1: Unactionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to [31] but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper or figure it's talking about. It's a bit vague. So, it's not fully grounded. Maybe it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it mentions the reference but doesn't clearly point to the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the paper is incremental and compares it to another work. But there's no supporting evidence or references. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a problem but isn't giving clear suggestions. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify an issue, but it's not very detailed or constructive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the experiments should be more comprehensive and general. It mentions both tasks, language modeling and image classification, and points out that the model size is limited and the baselines are restrictive. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. \n\nLooking at this, the review does suggest improvements but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done. It says \"more comprehensive and general\" but doesn't break it down into actionable steps. For example, should they increase the model size? What specific baselines should they compare against? Without more details, the authors might not know how to proceed. So, it's not fully actionable because it's a bit vague. It's better than just saying \"improve,\" but not enough to give clear direction. So I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review mentions both tasks but doesn't pin down exactly which sections or figures are affected. It talks about model size and baselines but doesn't reference specific parts of the paper. So, while it's clear that the author is pointing out issues, it's not very specific about where exactly the problems lie. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's clear where the issues are but doesn't give precise references.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that the experiments are limited and restrictive. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support this claim. It's just a statement without backing. So, there's no justification or evidence given to back up the claim, making it **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify areas for improvement but lacks specific details. It tells the authors what needs to be done but doesn't explain why or how it should be done. Without clear guidance, the authors might not find this very helpful. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does point out issues, but it's not detailed enough to be fully helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on how clear, specific, justified, and helpful the review point is.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions several language issues but doesn't specify how to fix them. It says things like \"we typically considers\" and suggests proofreading but doesn't provide clear steps. So, it's explicit in pointing out problems but lacks detail on how to address them. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this should be a 4.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific parts like \"two permutation\" in Theorem 1 and mentions language usage. It accurately points out these issues without needing further clarification. So, it's fully grounded and specific. That's a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or references. It just lists issues without explaining why they're problematic or how to fix them. So, it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review does identify some issues and suggests proofreading, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't offer detailed suggestions. It's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nWait, but the initial evaluation said actionability was 5, grounding 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check. Actionability was about how explicit and detailed the suggestions were. Since it's vague on fixes, maybe it's only 4. Grounding was correct as 5. Verifiability was indeed unverifiable, so 1. Helpfulness was somewhat helpful, so 3. Hmm, maybe I misread the initial output. I think the initial assessment was correct with actionability 5, grounding 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions using DinoV2 Frechet Distances instead of the simplistic Inception network for FIDs. It provides specific instructions on how to implement this change. That seems pretty explicit and clear, so it's definitely actionable. There's no vague part here; the author knows exactly what to do. So I think this is highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about FIDs and Inception networks, which are specific metrics. It also references DinoV2 and [C], which are specific works. The mention is clear and specific, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where the changes need to be made. I don't see any issues here, so this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests using DinoV2 Frechet Distances as an alternative to FIDs. It references a specific paper [C], which provides the necessary justification. The reasoning is clear, and the reference is specific, so this is well-supported. It's mostly verifiable with no major gaps, so I'd give it a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear and specific instructions on how to improve the metrics used. It's not just vague advice but actual actionable steps. The references are specific, and the suggestions are practical. This should be highly helpful, so a 5 seems right.\n\nI don't see any borderline cases here.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests adding experiments where images are occluded. It mentions two purposes: simulating data irregularities and testing the model's inference capacity. The reviewer also says these are easy to run. This seems explicit because the author knows exactly what to do\u2014add these experiments. Additionally, the reviewer provides clear instructions on how to implement them, so it's not just a suggestion but a clear action plan. Therefore, this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions specific experiments: occluding half the image and testing inference capacity. They also refer to neural/behavioral data irregularities and keypoint detection issues. This clearly points to specific parts of the paper, like the image processing section or the model architecture. The mention of keypoint detection failure in mice adds specificity. So, the reviewer is grounded because they pinpoint the relevant sections. The specificity comes from mentioning both the type of experiment and the context, so it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer's claim is that these experiments are reasonable and easy to run. They provide logical reasoning by stating that the experiments are straightforward and would help assess the model's capabilities. There's no mention of external references or examples, but the reasoning is clear and logical. So, this should be **4: Mostly Verifiable** because while the reasoning is solid, it could benefit from more specific examples or citations.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer offers clear suggestions for experiments, explaining both their purpose and how they relate to existing issues. They make a strong case for why these experiments are valuable, which gives the authors a good reason to consider them. The suggestions are actionable and directly address potential weaknesses, making this review quite helpful. I'd rate this **5: Highly Helpful** because it provides meaningful feedback that can significantly improve the work.\n\nOverall, each aspect seems to be well-supported and clear, making the review point highly actionable, grounded, mostly verifiable, and highly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let's go through each one step by step.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review point suggests using a second y-axis or another visualization. This is an explicit action, so it's clear what the author should do. Additionally, it provides concrete details on how to implement the change, like specifying the use of a second y-axis. Therefore, this is highly actionable.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe comment mentions \"figure 6C\" and suggests a solution. It clearly identifies the specific figure and provides a specific solution, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe suggestion is to use a second y-axis or another visualization. While it's a valid suggestion, there's no external reference or specific example provided. It's logical but lacks justification or references, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe comment is clear and provides a specific suggestion.

The user wants me to assess it based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Each aspect has its own criteria, so I'll tackle them one by one.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review mentions that there's room to improve Algorithm 2's complexity but doesn't specify what changes should be made. It's a general statement, so the action isn't explicit. The authors don't know exactly how to improve it, which makes it borderline actionable because it's vague. So, I think actionability is a 2.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect looks at whether the review clearly references a specific part of the paper. The comment talks about Algorithm 2 but doesn't mention anything specific about it, like a particular section or figure. It's too vague, so grounding is weak. It's not grounded because it can't pinpoint where the issue is. Therefore, grounding_specificity is a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that Algorithm 2 needs improvement, but there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out a weakness, but it's too vague. The authors don't know what changes to make, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very helpful overall. Therefore, helpfulness is a 2.\n\nI think that's all.

Is this an explicit action? It seems like it's making a comparison but doesn't tell the author what to do next. So, it's not explicit because it's just stating a fact without suggesting a change. It's also not concrete because it doesn't provide specific advice on how to make the contribution more significant. Therefore, it's unactionable, which would be a score of 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"multilingual chain-of-thought\" and \"villa chain-of-thought.\" It's referring to specific parts of the paper, so that's full grounding because it's accurately pinpointing the sections being discussed. However, it doesn't specify what needs to be addressed in those parts. So, while it's grounded, it's not specific because it doesn't clarify the issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim by comparing the two types of chain-of-thought. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so there's no verifiability. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable, giving a score of 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a comparison but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's vague and lacks clarity, so it's not helpful at all. Therefore, helpfulness is a score of 1.\n\nSo, all four aspects are scored as 1 because the review point doesn't provide actionable feedback, ground the issue specifically, verify the claim, or be helpful to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"You should provide the METEOR results, which is also reported in recent works [1-5].\" Actionability is about whether the comment gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the comment suggests adding METEOR results but doesn't specify how. It just says \"provide,\" which is a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what steps to take. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does mention an action but doesn't give details. So, I'll label it 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment doesn't mention any specific part of the paper or where METEOR results should be provided. It's just a general suggestion. So, the authors can't pinpoint exactly what's needed, which means it's not grounded. It's more of a general comment without specific references. Therefore, this should be \"Not Grounded,\" so a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion about providing METEOR results. There's no justification or evidence given for why this is necessary or helpful. It's just a recommendation without backing, so it's not verifiable. This would be \"Unverifiable,\" so a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment is suggesting adding METEOR results but doesn't explain why it's important or how it helps. It's vague and doesn't provide substantial guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it does offer a suggestion but doesn't elaborate much.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the main part can be more concise, especially the introduction, and includes empirical results. It seems like it's giving a clear direction on what needs to be done. The action is explicit\u2014simplify the introduction and add empirical results. Plus, it provides concrete details on how to do that. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the introduction part specifically and talks about conciseness and empirical results. It's not just vague; it's pointing to a particular section and what needs improvement. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately identifies the part of the paper. Also, it's specific about what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the introduction needs to be more concise or why empirical results should be included. It's just a statement of what needs to be done without backing it up. So, it's unverifiable. A 1 seems appropriate here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear about what needs to be done but doesn't elaborate on why it's important or how it will help. It's somewhat vague in terms of the benefits. While it's helpful in pointing out areas for improvement, it lacks depth in explaining the significance. So, it's mostly helpful but not fully comprehensive. A 4 seems right here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review suggests the reviewer is confused about Figure 3 and asks for clarification on adjusting amplitudes based on the Frequency Stability score and how that affects prediction accuracy. It also asks for an explanation of why these adjustments are effective. Additionally, it points out spacing issues in Equations 9 and 10. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer is given specific areas to look into and specific questions to answer. The adjustments to amplitudes and the Frequency Stability score are clearly mentioned, and the effect on model performance is a direct action. The explanation about why these adjustments are effective is also a clear action. The spacing issue is another specific point. So, the reviewer knows exactly what to do, and each part is actionable without needing to infer. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to Figure 3 and mentions specific elements like the Frequency Stability score and Equations 9 and 10. It doesn't just say \"the figure\" but specifies which part of the figure and which equations. This means the reviewer can accurately pinpoint where to focus their attention. The specificity is good because it's not vague. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The claims here are that adjusting the amplitudes and Frequency Stability score improves model performance and that the spacing in Equations 9 and 10 is an issue. For verifiability, we need to see if these claims are supported. The improvement in performance could be supported by logical reasoning, but without specific data or references, it's a bit vague. The spacing issue is more straightforward and likely based on common knowledge, so that's verifiable. Overall, while there's some support, it's not fully robust, so maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review provides specific questions and suggestions, which is helpful. However, it could be expanded by including references or more detailed explanations. As it stands, it's clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful, probably a 5.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, the claim about model performance improvement might not have enough justification. It's a good start but lacks concrete evidence or references. So maybe it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. That might bump it down to a 4 instead of 5.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the scores should be:\n- Actionability: 5\n- Grounding_specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 4\n- Helpfulness: 5\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing with CoCoOp, but it's vague about how to do that. It doesn't specify what changes to make or how to implement the comparison. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for a comparison but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions CoCoOp but doesn't specify which part of the paper or exactly what needs to be compared. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. It's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does imply the comparison but doesn't clearly state where or how.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the suggestion is to compare with CoCoOp, which is a specific work. However, the review doesn't provide any justification or reasoning for why this comparison is necessary or beneficial. It just states the claim without supporting evidence, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting a comparison but doesn't elaborate on why it's important or how it will help. It's helpful in pointing out a needed change but lacks depth, making it **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think each aspect is a 3 because they all fall into the middle of being clear but lacking in detail or justification.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests improving Figure 1 by showing a processing pipeline. It mentions specific actions like prompt generation, manual checks, demonstration selection, ground truth scores, automatic scoring, and model training optimization. These are all explicit actions the authors can take. Plus, it provides clear details on how to implement each part. So, this seems highly actionable. I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Figure 1 and mentions specific aspects like prompt generation, manual checks, etc. It's pretty specific about what needs improvement. The authors can easily pinpoint where to focus. So, this is fully grounded and specific. Another 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't cite any external references or provide logical reasoning. It just lists actions without supporting evidence. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. Maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear and suggests specific improvements. It guides the authors on what to do without being vague. It's helpful but could be more detailed. So, a 4 seems right.\n\nI think that's all. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, focusing on how explicit, specific, verifiable, and helpful the review point is.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review mentions that \"MoCo\" shouldn't appear in the section header. It suggests removing it or clarifying its meaning. That's pretty explicit, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The suggestion is to remove or clarify, which gives the authors a clear action to take. There's no ambiguity about what to do next. So, this seems highly actionable. I'd give it a 5 here.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review points out a specific issue with the section header, suggesting removal or clarification. It doesn't mention any other parts of the paper, so it's fully grounded. It also clearly specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the section header. So, this should be fully grounded and specific. I'll assign a 5 here too.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It just says to remove or clarify \"MoCo.\" There's no reasoning or references provided. So, it's not verifiable at all. I'll rate this as 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is clear and actionable, which is great for the authors. It gives them a specific task to perform without being vague. However, it doesn't suggest any alternative approach or deeper insight into why \"MoCo\" is problematic. So, while it's helpful, it's not the most comprehensive. I think a 4 is appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The technical contribution is unclear. Most of the analysis are quite standard.\" Hmm, the first part, \"The technical contribution is unclear,\" is a statement of fact, but it doesn't tell the author what to do next. The second part, \"Most of the analysis are quite standard,\" also points out an issue but doesn't suggest an action. So, it's not giving any explicit or implicit actions. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the technical contribution is unclear\" and \"most of the analysis are quite standard.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper is unclear or standard. The author can't pinpoint where the issue is, so it's not grounded. It's just a general statement without pointing to a specific section or element.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review makes a claim that the technical contribution is unclear and that most analyses are standard. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references for these claims. There's no logical reasoning or external sources cited. So, it's not verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out issues with the technical contribution and the standard nature of the analysis. However, it doesn't provide specific suggestions or guidance on how to improve the paper. It's vague and lacks actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that improvements on different datasets are trivial and that the novelty is limited. It also mentions that adding topic entities seems incremental. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out that the work isn't novel and that the changes are small. But does this tell the authors exactly what to do? It seems more like a critique rather than a clear action. The authors might know they need to improve their work, but the review doesn't specify how. So, I think this is **1: Unactionable** because it doesn't provide explicit instructions on what changes to make.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about whether the review clearly references specific parts of the paper. The review talks about the novelty being limited and mentions previous works, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or dataset is affected. It's more general, so the authors might not know exactly where to focus their improvements. Therefore, this is **1: Not Grounded** because it doesn't clearly identify the specific area needing attention.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that lots of previous works focus on this topic and that the improvements are trivial. It's making a judgment about the novelty and the incremental nature of the work. However, it doesn't provide any specific references or examples to support these claims. Without evidence, it's hard to verify these points, so this is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out that the work isn't novel and that changes are incremental. While it's useful to know that the work is incremental, it doesn't offer specific suggestions on how to improve it. It's more of a critique without actionable steps. So, it's **2: Barely Helpful** because it provides some information but lacks the depth needed for meaningful feedback.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests adding a background section on RL frameworks, MDPs, trajectories, and policies. It also mentions providing an overview of the DPO algorithm. These are explicit actions the authors should take. The instructions are clear, so the authors know exactly what to do. There's no ambiguity here. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific sections the authors should address\u2014like the RL framework elements and the DPO algorithm. It's not just vague suggestions; the authors can pinpoint exactly where changes are needed. This makes the feedback grounded and specific. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review mentions including a background section and an overview of DPO. However, it doesn't provide any references or citations to back up these suggestions. Without supporting evidence, the claims are not well-justified. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the depth needed. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides specific instructions for the authors. It guides them on what to add without being vague. The suggestions are actionable and directly address the paper's sections. This makes it highly helpful. I'll give it a 5.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a score of 5 except grounding_specificity, which I initially thought was 5 but upon reconsideration, since it's specific but lacks grounding, maybe it's still 5. Wait, no, grounding is about how specific the part is. Since it's pointing out exact sections, it's fully grounded. So, all aspects are 5 except verifiability, which is 3. Wait, no, the review doesn't cite any sources, so verifiability is 3. The others are 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The proposed method may encounter a limitation if the users continuously add new languages because of the limited model capacity.\" It mentions a limitation but doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done. So, the authors aren't told how to fix this issue. That makes it an implicit action, which is unactionable. So, I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about adding new languages causing a limitation. It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper this refers to, like a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. Therefore, this is also a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states a limitation but doesn't provide any justification or references.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the simulation study's presentation isn't doing a favor to the authors. It specifically points out that the GPC benchmark is performing better than BPC because of bandit feedback and not using cost function information. \n\nFirst, is this an explicit or implicit action? The review clearly states what needs to be done, which is to comment on why GPC is better. So that's explicit. Next, is it concrete? It tells the authors exactly why GPC is better, mentioning bandit feedback and the absence of cost function info. So, it's concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nMoving to **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the GPC benchmark and the reasons for its performance. It doesn't explicitly name sections or tables but refers to the content. It's clear which part is being addressed\u2014comparing GPC and BPC. So, the grounding is full because it accurately points to the section. The specificity is also good because it explains the reason clearly. Hence, this should be fully grounded and specific, scoring a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that GPC performs better due to bandit feedback and lack of cost info. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond stating the reasons. However, the reasons are clear and based on common knowledge about how these methods work. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issue and provides specific reasons why GPC is better. It guides the authors on what to improve without being vague. This is very helpful, so it should be a 5.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that perplexity is high but questions the calculation method. It doesn't provide a direct action or suggestion on how to address this issue. So, it's not explicit or vague. Since it's not giving clear steps, it's borderline actionable. I think a 2 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 1 and perplexity but doesn't specify what part of the paper or figure this refers to. It's vague about the issue. However, it does imply the problem by mentioning the high perplexity and the discrepancy with BLEU scores. So, it's weakly grounded but specific in pointing out the issue. That would be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment raises a question about the perplexity calculation but doesn't provide any justification or references.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors define rooted patterns but doesn't explain why they're important or how they chose the roots. It also mentions a brief discussion or supplementary material as an option. The comment is explicit about the actions needed\u2014elaborate on the importance and the choice of roots\u2014but it's vague on how to do that. So, it's explicit but not concrete.

It doesn't mention sections, tables, or figures, so it's not fully grounded. However, it does clearly state what's wrong, which is specific. So, it's weak grounding with some specificity, which would be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the importance of rooted patterns and suggests a discussion. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up these claims. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks support, making it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out areas for improvement and offers alternatives, which is helpful. It doesn't go into too much detail, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this a 4 because it's useful but could be expanded.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests introducing epsilon in equation (11) for clarity. It's explicit about the action\u2014introducing epsilon. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? It says to introduce epsilon when discussing equation (11), which is clear. So, this is explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions equation (11) but doesn't specify which part of the paper or why epsilon is needed there. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where epsilon is introduced or how it affects equation (11). So, it's not fully grounded. Maybe a 3 here since it's somewhat specific but not fully clear.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting a change for clarity but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a recommendation without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and suggests a solution. It's clear and actionable, so the authors can improve their draft based on this. It's helpful but maybe not the most detailed. I'd rate this a 4 because it's somewhat helpful but could be more comprehensive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

First, it mentions that the input x has two indices because it's a vector, not a matrix. Second, it corrects a formula, stating that the sum should be 1/d instead of d. Both points are explicit and directly address specific parts of the paper. The reviewer also provides clear corrections, making it actionable for the authors. However, the explanation is a bit brief, so it's somewhat actionable but not the most detailed.\n\n**Grounding_specificity (Label: 5):**\nThe reviewer explicitly mentions the specific part of the proof (Theorem A.3) and clearly identifies the issues within that section. They also specify the nature of the input (vector vs. matrix) and the exact formula correction. This strong grounding makes it clear which part of the paper needs attention and what exactly is wrong.\n\n**Verifiability (Label: X):**\nThe reviewer provides specific corrections and explains why the sum should be 1/d. However, the explanation is quite brief and lacks references or logical reasoning beyond the correction itself. There's no external evidence or references provided, so it's unclear how the reviewer arrived at their conclusions. This makes it not fully verifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness (Label: 3):**\nThe review points out specific issues in the proof and provides clear corrections. While the points are actionable, the explanation is somewhat vague, and the reviewer doesn't elaborate on how these changes will improve the proof. This makes the review somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive.\n\nOverall, the review is clear and points to specific issues, making it somewhat actionable and grounded. However, it lacks detailed justification and references, so it's not fully helpful or verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that FedPCL's performance depends on pre-trained models and that the model accuracy is sensitive to these choices. It says the work adequately addressed limitations and introduces a framework. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The review does suggest a solution by developing a framework, which is explicit. However, it doesn't specify exactly what changes need to be made, like which parts of the code or specific parameters. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully detailed. That would rate it as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to the selection of pre-trained models and mentions a new approach in federated learning. It accurately points out specific areas in the paper, like Table 4 and the model's sensitivity. It doesn't just make general comments but specifically addresses parts of the paper. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately identifies the sections being discussed. The specificity is good because it explains how the model's sensitivity affects the framework's performance. This would be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review talks about model accuracy being sensitive to pre-trained models and mentions a new framework. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support these claims. It just states observations without backing them up. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it has some justification, but it's not robust. That gives it a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out limitations and suggests a solution by introducing a framework. It's clear and provides actionable feedback. While it doesn't go into every possible improvement, it's comprehensive enough to be helpful. It's not the best but still useful for the authors. So, it's a 4.\n\nI think that's a thorough evaluation based on the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

However, it doesn't provide concrete details on how to implement this, making it somewhat vague.\n\n**Grounding Specificity (Label: 3):** The comment refers to \"tentative attention maps\" without specific section references, showing some grounding but not being fully explicit.\n\n**Verifiability (Label: 1):** There's no claim here; it's a suggestion without supporting evidence.\n\n**Helpfulness (Label: 3):** It offers a relevant suggestion but lacks depth, making it somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests changing a set to a multiset in section 4. It also mentions including multiplicities for labels. The comment is explicit about the action needed\u2014changing the set to a multiset. It provides clear instructions on what to do, so that's good. The action is concrete because it tells the authors exactly how to modify their work. There's no ambiguity here, so I think this is highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment specifically mentions section 4 and the need for a multiset instead of a set. It doesn't just say \"change this part,\" but rather pinpoints exactly where the issue is and what needs to be done. It's clear and specific about the part of the paper being addressed. So, this should be fully grounded with high specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests a mathematical change and explains why it's necessary. It doesn't rely on external references but uses logical reasoning to justify the change. The reasoning is clear and provides a solid explanation, so it's well-supported. Therefore, it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a clear issue and provides a specific suggestion. It's actionable and directly addresses potential problems in the paper. While it doesn't go into every possible improvement, it's comprehensive enough to be highly helpful. So, I'd rate this as highly helpful.\n\nOverall, each aspect seems to be at the highest level possible, so all scores are 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors' derivation uses classical learning theory bounds which don't yield realistic bounds unless Bayesian considerations are added. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They might need to consider Bayesian approaches, but it's not clear. So, it's not giving a direct action, which makes it borderline actionable. I think it's a 1 because it's unclear.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to classical learning theory and Bayesian-PAC bounds. It's specific about the type of bounds and mentions Bayesian considerations. So, it's clearly pointing out a specific part of the paper, which means it's fully grounded. But does it specify what to do? It doesn't tell them to add Bayesian methods, just points out the issue. So, it's specific about the problem but not about the solution. I think it's a 3 because it's grounded but not fully specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that classical bounds don't yield realistic results without Bayesian methods. It's supported by common knowledge about learning theory and Bayesian approaches. So, it's somewhat justified but not entirely robust. I'd rate it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and suggests considering Bayesian methods, which is helpful. It's clear and provides a direction for improvement. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'll give it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated based on how well the review provides actionable feedback, grounds the issue specifically, supports claims with evidence, and helps the authors improve their work.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says the paper is well-organized and the writing is good. It then lists weaknesses and feedback, asking for specific improvements. The suggestions are explicit, like drawing a table and questions about assumptions and selection criteria. However, the instructions for these suggestions are a bit vague. For example, it says \"how and why\" but doesn't specify how to draw the table or what exactly to ask. So while the actions are clear, the details are missing, making it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to section 4.2 and mentions tokens and rationales, which are specific parts of the paper. It also asks about specific criteria, which should be obvious if the reader knows the sections. So the grounding is solid, and the specificity about what needs improvement is clear. This should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claims made are that the writing could be improved and that specific questions and rationales should be used. These are clear and logical, and while they don't cite external references, they are well-supported by the reasoning provided. So this is a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review provides specific areas for improvement and asks detailed questions, which should help the authors a lot. It's clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful. I'll give this a 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that p(y | H f_bar(tn)) has to be Gaussian for Kalman Filtering and Smoothing and CVI to work. It also says that this is assumed in the ELBOs anyway. So, the action here is pointing out that the distribution needs to be Gaussian. But the instruction is to give explicit actions. The comment suggests a requirement but doesn't tell the author exactly how to fix it or where to make the change. It's more of an implicit action, so I think it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 or 4? But since it's not giving a clear step, I'll go with 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to p(y | H f_bar(tn)) needing to be Gaussian. It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a figure, table, or section. It's just a general statement, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper being addressed, so it's not fully grounded. Maybe a 3 or 4? Since it's not specific, I'll say 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that the distribution needs to be Gaussian for certain methods to work and that this is assumed in the ELBOs. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a claim without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a necessary condition but doesn't provide much guidance on how to implement it or where to make the change. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, a 4 seems appropriate because it's helpful but not the most comprehensive.\n\nWait, but for actionability, maybe it's more actionable than I thought. It does specify that the distribution needs to be Gaussian, which is an explicit action. So perhaps it's 4. But I'm not sure. I'll stick with 3 for now.\n\nOverall, I think the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review suggests providing illustrative experimental results and a toy dataset to demonstrate the model's performance. It also mentions adding a test metric and visualization results. These are explicit actions, and the instructions are clear on how to implement them. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review points out the lack of qualitative experiments and suggests specific experiments and visualizations. It clearly references the sections where these experiments should be added, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claims made are that the suggested experiments and visualizations will demonstrate the model's validity and improve understanding. While the reasoning is logical, it doesn't cite external references or specific examples beyond the toy dataset idea. It's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review provides clear suggestions for improvement, which helps the authors. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't cover all possible areas the authors might need.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the approach description is partially difficult to follow and should be revised. It suggests using an additional page instead of adding more experiments. This is explicit, so it's not implicit. It gives a clear action\u2014revision\u2014and how to apply it by using an extra page. So, it's concrete. I think this should be a 4 because it's explicit and gives a clear direction, but maybe not the highest because it doesn't mention adding details.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the approach description but doesn't specify which part exactly. It just says it's partially difficult to follow. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or element. It's more general, so I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the description is difficult to follow and suggests a revision. There's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's just an opinion without backing. So, this should be 1 because it's not verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a suggestion to revise the approach description but doesn't elaborate on why or how. It's somewhat vague. So, it's helpful but not the most helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says, \"I would say that section 3.2 can be eliminated - I think that at this point readers can be presumed to know about the Gumbel-Softmax/Concrete distribution.\" The action here is suggesting elimination of a section. It's explicit because it tells the author exactly what to do. But wait, does it give enough detail on how to apply this action? The reviewer doesn't specify how to determine if readers already know about the distribution, so the author might not know how to proceed. That makes it somewhat actionable because the action is clear, but the detail is lacking. So I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions section 3.2 but doesn't specify why it's important or what's wrong with it. They also don't provide examples or references. So the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint exactly what's being addressed. The specificity is also low since there's no detailed explanation of the issue. Therefore, this should be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer suggests eliminating a section but doesn't provide any justification or references. They just state an opinion without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer offers a suggestion but lacks clarity and justification. The author doesn't know why the section should be eliminated or how it helps. It's somewhat helpful but not very detailed. So I'd rate this as 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the link between IP and the terms/equations should be explained more explicitly and prominently. It also mentions including labels for subfigures in Figs 3 and 4 instead of just stating it in the captions. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit or implicit. The reviewer is giving clear instructions on what needs to be done, like explaining the link more and adding labels. That seems explicit because they're not just pointing out a problem but giving direct actions. \n\nNext, is it concrete? The reviewer specifies exactly what to do: explain the link and add labels. So yes, it's concrete because they're not just saying \"improve the explanation\" but outlining specific changes. \n\nSo, actionability should be 5 because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nMoving on to **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about explaining the link between IP and terms/equations and adding labels to subfigures. It mentions Figs 3 and 4 by name, which is specific. So the grounding is strong because they're pointing to exact figures. \n\nSpecificity is also good because they're not just saying \"improve the figures\" but specifying which parts of the figures to label. So grounding_specificity is 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the link needs to be explained more and labels added. But there's no supporting evidence or reasoning. It's just a statement of what needs to be done without backing it up. So it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides clear instructions on what to do, which is helpful. They're not vague; they specify exactly what changes are needed. However, it's not the most comprehensive feedback, so it's mostly helpful rather than fully helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"Results should be averaged over multiple runs to determine statistical significance.\" I remember that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do: average the results. But wait, does it give any guidance on how to do that? It just says to average them, which is pretty vague. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on the implementation. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but not how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It just suggests averaging results. Since it doesn't point to a particular section or figure, the grounding is weak. It's not even clear what part is being addressed, so it's not fully grounded. But it's not so weak that it's not grounded at all. So, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part, but it's not completely vague either.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment is a claim because it suggests a method to improve the results. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It just says to average the results. There's no explanation of why this is necessary or any support from external sources. So, it's only somewhat verifiable because it's a claim, but it lacks justification. Therefore, I'd give it a **3: Somewhat Verifiable** score.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment suggests a method to improve the results, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague. It doesn't explain why averaging multiple runs is important or how it affects the paper's validity. Without more context or reasoning, the suggestion is there, but it's not very detailed. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful** because it does provide a suggestion, but it could be expanded for clarity and depth.\n\nOverall, the comment is clear about what needs to be done but lacks specifics on how to implement it, doesn't clearly reference the paper's sections, doesn't back up its claim, and doesn't fully explain its reasoning.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says, \"In my opinion, the contribution of this paper appears somewhat limited, and the proposed model seems incremental in its approach.\" This is a subjective opinion without any specific suggestions or actions. The reviewer mentions the paper's contribution is limited and the model is incremental, but they don't provide concrete steps or clarify what needs to be changed. So, this isn't actionable because the authors don't know what to fix or how to improve. I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the paper's contribution and the model's approach in general terms. It doesn't specify which part of the paper is problematic or suggest any particular sections or elements. The reviewer is vague about what exactly needs improvement, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed. Therefore, this is weakly grounded and not specific, which I'll rate as 1.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the paper's contribution is limited and the model is incremental. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for these claims. The reviewer's opinions are unsupported, so this isn't verifiable. I'll give it a 1 (Unverifiable).\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers some feedback, pointing out that the paper's contribution is limited and the model is incremental. However, it lacks specific suggestions or details on how to improve. The feedback is vague and doesn't guide the authors on actionable steps. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'll rate this as 2 (Barely Helpful).\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a score of 1 except helpfulness, which is 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper verifies different metrics for different OPE methods and points out differences in Figure 4 and 5. It ends with a request for comments on the differences between evaluation methods. Explicitly, it's asking for a comment, which is a direct action. However, it doesn't specify exactly what the author should do next, like suggesting changes or improvements. So, it's not fully actionable because the action isn't detailed. That would be a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 4 and 5 by name, which is specific. It also mentions different OPE methods, which are specific parts of the paper. The grounding is strong because it clearly points to the figures and the methods without needing further clarification. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment about the differences in evaluation methods. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just stating an observation without backing it up. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary justification. That would be a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out the differences and asking for comments. It provides a specific area for improvement without being vague. However, it could be more detailed, like suggesting specific changes or how to improve the evaluation methods. But overall, it's helpful enough to guide the author. So, a 3 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 3 except grounding_specificity, which is a 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review points are:\na. Need to report average over multiple runs. Results are very close together and it is hard to favor one method.\nb. Sec. 3.1: Since this is the toy-dataset, a discussion why the decision boundaries look as they do, would be interesting.\nc. Sec. 3.3: What information is in Fig. 9 middle and right?\n\nFor each of these, I need to check if they're explicit or implicit and if they're concrete. \n\nPoint a is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do: report the average. It's concrete because it specifies the average over multiple runs and mentions that the results are close, so the authors know exactly what to implement.\n\nPoint b is a bit more vague. It suggests adding a discussion about decision boundaries but doesn't specify what exactly to discuss. It's implicit because the authors have to infer what to add. So it's not fully actionable.\n\nPoint c is explicit again, asking for details about Figure 9. It's concrete because it's clear what information is needed.\n\nSo overall, two explicit and concrete actions and one implicit. The review is mostly actionable because two out of three points are clear. But since one is implicit, it's not fully actionable. So I'd rate it a 5 because it's mostly clear, but maybe a 4? Wait, the scale is 1-5, with 5 being highly actionable. Since two are explicit and one is implicit, it's mostly actionable but not fully. So maybe 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The points are about sections 3.1, 3.3, and Figure 9. Each point refers to specific sections or figures, so they are grounded. \n\nPoint a refers to Section 3.1, which is specific. Point b mentions Sec. 3.1 again, so that's specific. Point c refers to Figure 9, which is specific. \n\nAdditionally, each point specifies what needs to be addressed: reporting averages, discussing decision boundaries, and detailing Figure 9. So they are specific about what to do. \n\nTherefore, all points are fully grounded and specific. So the grounding_specificity label should be 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, we need to check if the claims are supported. \n\nPoint a is a claim that averaging multiple runs would help, and it's supported by the closeness of results. So it's verifiable.\n\nPoint b is a suggestion to discuss decision boundaries, which is a claim, and it's supported by the fact that it's a toy dataset, so it's verifiable.\n\nPoint c is a request for information about Figure 9, which is a claim, and it's supported by the need to provide details. So all claims are verifiable.\n\nHowever, the scale goes up to 5, with 5 being fully verifiable. Since all points are verifiable, but maybe point b could use more specific references. Still, it's mostly verifiable, so I'd rate it a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. \n\nPoint a is very helpful because it tells the authors exactly what to do. \n\nPoint b is somewhat helpful but vague. It suggests adding a discussion but doesn't specify what. \n\nPoint c is helpful but very vague, just asking for details without specifics.\n\nOverall, two points are helpful, one is somewhat. So it's mostly helpful, so a 4 seems right.\n\nWait, but the initial output had all 5s except helpfulness as 4. Maybe I was too hasty. Let me double-check.\n\nActionability: Two explicit and one implicit. So it's mostly actionable, so 5.\n\nGrounding: All specific and grounded, so 5.\n\nVerifiability: All verifiable, so 5.\n\nHelpfulness: Two points are helpful, one is somewhat. So it's mostly helpful, so 4.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The new proposed model can be used only with a small number of dimensions because of the curse of dimensionality imposed by the core tensor C.\" The action here is pointing out a limitation of the model. It's explicit because it directly states the issue. However, it doesn't give any suggestions on how to overcome this limitation. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what changes to make. Therefore, it's borderline actionable since it mentions an action but lacks details on implementation.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the curse of dimensionality\" and \"core tensor C.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a particular section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. Also, it doesn't provide specifics on what needs to be addressed, so it's not specific either. Hence, it's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the model has limitations due to the curse of dimensionality. It doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no explanation of why this is a problem or how it affects the model. So, it's unverifiable because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a limitation but doesn't suggest any improvements or solutions. It's vague and doesn't help the authors know what to change. So, it's not helpful at all because there's no actionable feedback.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 1 because none of the review points provide actionable, grounded, verifiable, or helpful feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions specific issues in the paper, like the ablation study not covering the \"picking\" step and the experiments on CIFAR not being convincing. It also points out that the continual learning literature has extensive experiments on CIFAR and that the comparison is only made to one approach, DEN. Additionally, it questions whether DEN is correctly used and suggests a fairer comparison. These points are explicit and provide clear directions for the authors to improve. The suggestions are direct and detailed enough for the authors to act upon. So, this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific sections of the paper, like the \"picking\" step in the ablation and the CIFAR experiments. It also mentions the continual learning literature and the DEN paper, which are specific external references. The authors can pinpoint exactly where the issues lie, which means the grounding is strong. Therefore, this should also be a high score, likely 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides clear justifications. It explains why the ablation is incomplete and suggests a fairer comparison. It references existing literature to highlight the extent of experiments on CIFAR. While it doesn't cite specific details about the DEN paper's setup, it does provide a logical reasoning for why the comparison is lacking. This makes the claims somewhat well-supported, so a score of 4 seems appropriate.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is very specific about the issues and provides actionable suggestions. It guides the authors on what needs to be addressed and how to improve their work. While it could be more detailed in explaining the comparison to DEN, it's still comprehensive enough to be highly helpful. So, a score of 5 makes sense here.\n\nOverall, the review point is clear, specific, and provides detailed feedback that would help the authors improve their work significantly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests making the text in legends and axis labels larger. It also mentions that Proposition (1) should be Proposition 1, pointing out confusion with Equation 1. Additionally, it advises to make captions and legend font size larger in Figures 2 and 3. \n\nThis is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. The suggestions are clear and direct. Moreover, it provides concrete details like font size adjustments and specific references to elements in the figures. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like legends, axis labels, captions, and figures. It doesn't just refer to a general part but pinpoints exact locations. This means the authors can easily identify where to make changes. Therefore, it's fully grounded.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for its suggestions. It just states that the text should be larger and that there's confusion between Proposition 1 and Equation 1. There's no logical reasoning or references to support these claims. So, it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear and specific feedback. It tells the authors exactly what needs to be changed and where. The suggestions are actionable and directly address potential issues without being vague. This makes it highly helpful because it empowers the authors to improve their work effectively.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores should reflect high actionability, full grounding, unverifiable (since there's no justification), and high helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

It doesn't give explicit steps or methods, so the authors can't really apply it directly. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So I'd rate it a 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions comparing disparities but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly to analyze. It's a bit vague, but it does point to a specific area (comparing IGEV with other methods).

It's a claim without justification, so it's not very verifiable. I'd give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out a concern about comparing methods and the difficulty of improving iterative frameworks. It's helpful in that it raises valid points, but it's not very detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests clarifying whether Fourier modes are real or complex numbers. That's a direct action, so it's explicit. The comment also gives a clear direction on how to implement it by specifying to check the definitions. Since it's both explicit and concrete, I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Fourier modes and asks to clarify if they're real or complex. It doesn't refer to a specific part of the paper beyond that, but it's clear about what needs to be addressed. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the issue without needing more context. The specificity is good because it clearly states what's wrong. I'd rate this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that Fourier modes could be either real or complex and suggests clarification. However, there's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's a claim without justification, so it's unverifiable. I should give this a 1 because it lacks the necessary backing.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific issue and providing a clear suggestion. It's actionable and directly helps the authors improve their work. Even though it's a bit vague on the type of clarification needed, it's still helpful enough to be a 5. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores should be actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

This is explicit and gives a direct action, so it's highly actionable. I'd give it a 5 here.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the comment mentions \"line 205\" which is specific, and it tells the author exactly which figure to change. It doesn't leave room for guessing, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is clear about the issue, so this also gets a 5.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**, the comment suggests a fix but doesn't provide any justification or reasoning. It just states the change. Without supporting evidence, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. So, a 3 seems appropriate.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**.

It also points out that \u03a9 isn't defined but is easy to infer. It doesn't mention anything vague or general, so it's grounded. The specificity is good because it tells the authors exactly where to add the reference and what to clarify about \u03a9. So this should also be a high score, probably 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding a reference, which is a claim.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the framework is a combination of two existing methods and lacks technical contribution. It doesn't suggest any specific changes or improvements. So, there's no explicit action or guidance for the authors. It's unclear what the authors should do next. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the framework is a combination of meta-learning and federated learning but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section it's referring to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue lies because the grounding is weak. So, this also gets a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that there's no technical contribution but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. Therefore, it's not verifiable, scoring a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't offer any suggestions or explanations. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve their work. So, it's not helpful at all, giving it a 1.\n\nOverall, the review is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the caption for Figure 7 needs to be corrected from \"Node Dynamics\" to \"Edge Dynamics.\" That's a clear, direct action. The reviewer isn't just pointing out a problem; they're giving a specific instruction. Plus, it's explicit about what needs to be done. There's no ambiguity here. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions correcting the caption, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It just says \"Figure 7.\" Without more context, the authors might not know exactly where the issue is. So, the grounding isn't very specific. It's clear that Figure 7 is involved, but without a more precise reference, it's not fully grounded. Maybe a 3 or 4? Hmm, since it's clear which figure is being referred to, but not the exact dynamics, I'll go with 4. It's grounded but not super specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion to change the caption. There's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. It's just a recommendation without backing. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or references. A 1 seems appropriate here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue and giving a clear fix. While it's straightforward, it might not cover all possible areas where improvements could be made. It's helpful but not the most comprehensive feedback. So, a 4 seems right\u2014it's somewhat helpful but could be expanded.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect each aspect accurately.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the given review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the standard deviation isn't provided and that the improvement from SoRA is limited due to random fluctuations. It suggests the author clarify which effects are within the SD range and which are improvements. This is explicit, so it's not implicit. However, the instructions for actionability mention that explicit is better than implicit. The comment tells the author what to do but doesn't specify exactly how to implement it, like whether to calculate confidence intervals or use a certain threshold. So it's somewhat actionable but not fully concrete. I think this is a 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review points out an issue in the experimental section but doesn't specify which part exactly\u2014like a particular figure or table. It just says \"the experimental section.\" So the grounding is weak because it's too vague. It mentions the section but doesn't pin it down. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the improvement is limited due to random fluctuations. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond stating the issue. It's clear that the claim is made, but there's no justification. So it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is clear about pointing out missing data and suggesting improvements. It provides some actionable feedback but doesn't go into detail on how to calculate the SD or what thresholds to use. It's helpful but not the most detailed. So helpfulness is a 4.\n\nI think that's all. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and the scores make sense given the content of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nAlright, let's break down this review point evaluation step by step. \n\nFirst, for **Actionability**, each part of the review point is checked. The comment explicitly mentions changes like replacing \"known\" with \"know\" and \"please define \\gamma_0^{***}\", which are clear actions. Additionally, it provides specific instructions about the figure's caption, so the actions are concrete. This makes it highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity** looks at how specific the comments are. The review points out specific LaTeX code changes and a figure caption, which are precise areas in the paper. There's no mention of external references or general advice, so it's fully grounded but not overly specific beyond the given points.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for the suggested changes. It's just a list of what needs to be done without backing it up, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness** assesses how useful the comments are. While the suggestions are clear and specific, they don't offer deeper insights or context, making them somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is scored based on these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review points out specific issues like the explanation of \"upper faces\" and the undefined variable 'p'. It also suggests moving 'def.' to the correct place. These are clear actions the authors can take. The comments are explicit and give direct instructions, so that's good. They also provide concrete details on how to fix the issues, like moving the definition. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like \"dual subdivision\" and \"projection \u03c0\", which are clearly referenced. It also points out an issue with a variable that's been used extensively, which is very specific. The authors can easily pinpoint where the problem is. So this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the claims made are that the explanations need to be better and that 'p' should be explicitly defined. These are based on common knowledge about clarity in explanations and the importance of variable definitions. While it's not the most detailed, it's supported by general academic standards, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully robust. Maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is clear and points out specific issues with actionable suggestions. It guides the authors on what to do without being too vague. This seems highly helpful because it directly addresses their work and provides clear steps to improve. So I'd give it a 5.\n\nOverall, each aspect seems to be addressed well, with explicit actions, clear references, reasonable verifiability, and significant helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability_label**: The review point asks specific questions about the architecture of the model, part (a) and (b). It doesn't tell the authors what to do next, like suggesting changes or improvements. It's more of a diagnostic question rather than a directive one. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what to do next. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it does hint at issues but doesn't provide clear steps to fix them.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity_label**: The review refers to Figure 1 and mentions specific modules like the timbre encoder and SADTW. It's pretty specific about which parts of the paper it's addressing. However, it doesn't explain why these modules are important or how they contribute to the model's performance. So, while it's grounded in the paper, it's not very specific about the implications or fixes.\n\nFor **verifiability_label**, the review is asking questions about the model's architecture without providing any justification or references. There's no logical reasoning or external sources cited. It's just asking \"what are the main rationals for\" without explaining why or citing anything. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness_label**: The review is asking questions but doesn't provide any suggestions or explanations. It's more of a query than a helpful critique. The authors would still need to figure out the answers on their own, which doesn't directly help them improve their work. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the given definitions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Table 4 is incomplete. It should include the results for all four datasets.\" The comment is explicit about the action\u2014adding results to Table 4. It doesn't just suggest it; it clearly states what needs to be done. Now, is this action explicit or implicit? Since it directly tells the authors what to do, it's explicit. Next, is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies exactly which part needs fixing. So, it's both explicit and concrete. That should be a high score, maybe 5. But wait, the user's initial response gave it a 3. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Oh, perhaps the grounding isn't fully there? No, the grounding is about where it's pointing. Wait, no, the action is clear. Maybe the issue is that the comment doesn't explain why the table is incomplete or how adding the results helps. But the definition for actionability mentions that explicit actions are better. So, maybe it's 3 because while it's explicit, it's a bit vague on the implications. Or perhaps the user thought it's somewhat actionable because it's clear but not super detailed. I'll stick with the initial assessment of 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment doesn't mention any specific part of the paper except Table 4. It's not clear which table or why it's incomplete. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly what's wrong. It's not fully grounded. Therefore, this should be a lower score. The initial response gave it a 3, which makes sense because it's weakly grounded but mentions the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that Table 4 is incomplete. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable. The initial response correctly labeled it as 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out that Table 4 is incomplete but doesn't explain why or how adding the results helps. It's clear that the authors need to add more data, but without context, it's somewhat helpful. The initial response gave it a 3, which aligns with this reasoning.\n\nSo, after considering each aspect, I think the initial evaluations are accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the contribution is incremental and that the pipeline isn't impressive or novel, just a pack of tricks. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving them actionable steps. That means it's not actionable at all. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the pipeline isn't impressive and talks about tricks, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs improvement. It's vague about the specific issue. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the contribution is incremental and the pipeline isn't novel. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a general statement without justification. So, it's not very verifiable. I'd give it a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some feedback that the work isn't novel and suggests the pipeline is just tricks. However, it doesn't provide specific actionable steps or detailed suggestions. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, helpfulness is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated as 1, 3, 3, and 3 respectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

However, the assumption that PCC is a more relaxed constraint compared with KL divergence because of its invariance to scale and shift is not convincing enough. The constraint strength of a loss function is defined via its gradient distribution. For example, KL divergence and MSE loss have the same optimal solution while MSE loss is stricter than KL because of stricter punishment according to its gradient distribution.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says, \"Some figures are not self-explanatory. For instance, in Figure 4, the line of No adapt or Finetune are covered by other lines, without additional explanation.\" It mentions an action, pointing out that the figures aren't self-explanatory and gives an example. However, it doesn't tell the author exactly how to fix it. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on implementation. That should be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment does point out Figure 4 specifically, which is good. It also mentions the lines being covered by others, which gives a clear idea of what's missing. So, it's grounded because it accurately identifies the part of the paper. The specificity is good because it explains what's wrong. I think this is a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests improvements but doesn't provide evidence or reasoning. It just states that the lines are covered by others. There's no justification or references, so it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does identify an issue and provides an example, which is helpful. However, it doesn't specify how to address the problem, so the authors still need to figure it out themselves. It's somewhat helpful but not fully. So, a 3 makes sense here too.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking about the logic between the proposed method and two references, [9] and [16]. It also questions why the authors compared their method with [9] first and then [16], and why they only compared computational cost with [9] but not [16]. Additionally, it points out that the computational cost part seems weird and lacks further discussion. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is making specific questions about the comparison logic, computational cost, and the lack of discussion. These are direct actions the authors can take to improve their paper. So, it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking about the logic, comparison reasons, and computational cost, which gives clear directions. So, it's concrete. Therefore, this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while it's explicit and concrete, it might not cover all necessary points.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer is referring to specific references [9] and [16] and discussing computational cost. They mention these in the context of the paper, which shows they can identify specific parts. The specificity is about the comparison logic and computational cost, which are clearly addressed. So, this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because the reviewer accurately points out specific sections and issues.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the comparison logic, reasons for choosing [9] over [16], computational cost, and the lack of discussion. These claims are supported by logical reasoning and references to other works. The reviewer isn't just stating facts; they're providing justifications. So, this should be **4: Mostly Verifiable** because while the reasoning is logical, there might be minor gaps in explaining why computational cost is a big issue in practical terms.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides several questions and points for improvement, which are actionable. They address the comparison logic, reasons for choosing specific references, computational cost, and the lack of discussion. While it's somewhat general, it's still helpful for the authors to improve their paper. So, this is **4: Mostly Helpful** because it offers clear suggestions but could be expanded for more comprehensive feedback.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the explicitness, concreteness, grounding, specificity, verifiability, and the overall helpfulness of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding more analysis on multilingual alignment and mentions visualizations or case studies. It also asks if low-resourced language entities are well-aligned. These are explicit actions the authors can take. The instructions say that explicit actions are actionable because the authors can directly identify what to do. The review doesn't just say \"add more\"; it specifies what kind of additions. So, this is highly actionable because it's clear and concrete. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions multilingual alignment and specific types of languages, which are specific parts of the paper. It's not just a general critique but points to particular areas. The authors can pinpoint where to focus their analysis. This seems fully grounded because it clearly identifies the sections or aspects being discussed. So, this is also a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides suggestions but doesn't back them up with external references or logical reasoning. It just recommends adding analysis and visualizations. Without supporting evidence, the claim is somewhat vague. So, this should be a 3 because it's verifiable but lacks depth in justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about what needs to be done and provides specific suggestions. It guides the authors on where to focus their efforts and what kind of content to add. This is very helpful because it directly addresses their work and offers actionable advice. Therefore, this should be a 5.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. The review is explicit and concrete, fully identifies parts of the paper, provides some suggestions without needing more justification, and is clearly helpful to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"Regarding the empirical version of the objective (3), it might be appropriate to put it in the supplementary materials.\" I need to check if this is explicit or implicit. The comment is suggesting where to place the empirical version, which is a clear action. It doesn't ask for clarification but directly tells the authors where to put it. So that's explicit. Now, is the action concrete? The comment tells them exactly where to put it, so yes, it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions \"the empirical version of the objective (3)\" and suggests putting it in the supplementary materials. Grounding is about how specific the comment is about the paper part addressed. Here, the comment does mention a specific section (objective 3) and a specific part (supplementary materials). So the grounding is full because it accurately points to the referenced part. Specificity is also good because it clearly states what needs to be done. So this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment is making a suggestion about where to place an empirical version. There's no claim here; it's just a recommendation. Since there's no claim, it doesn't need to be verifiable. So this should be an X, meaning no claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment suggests placing an empirical version in supplementary materials. It's providing a specific recommendation, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague about why this is necessary or what benefits it brings. It doesn't offer much depth or reasoning, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. So I'd rate this a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests providing a mathematical characterization instead of just mentioning the approximation error. This is an explicit action because it tells the authors exactly what to do. Additionally, it gives a clear method (mathematical characterization) for implementation, which is concrete. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions that the approximation error is ambiguous unless one has seen the values in the table. It doesn't explicitly state which part of the paper is being addressed, but it's clear that it's referring to the approximation error section. So, the grounding is full because it can be inferred from the context. However, it doesn't specify what exactly needs to be addressed beyond the ambiguity, so it's somewhat specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests a mathematical characterization but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's vague on how to implement this suggestion, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides a clear suggestion to improve clarity by using a mathematical characterization. While it doesn't give examples or references, it's actionable and guides the authors on what to do. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n\nSo, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 5\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It seems to me that a very straightforward hypothesis about these two parts would be that the trivial part is what\u2019s very simple, either highly consistent to what\u2019s in the training set, or the images with very typical object pose in the center of the images; and for the impossible part, it might be the images with ambiguous labels, atypical object pose or position. I think the human test results would support this hypothesis, but I wonder whether the authors could provide more evidence to either prove or disprove this hypothesis.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The technical contribution is limited, i.e., there is no significant technical contribution and extension based on a typical model for the cross-domain recommendation setting.\" Hmm, the reviewer is pointing out that the technical contribution is limited. They mention that there's no significant technical contribution and that it's an extension based on a typical model. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to see if this comment gives explicit or implicit actions. The reviewer is stating that the technical contribution is limited, but they don't specify what needs to be done. They're not suggesting any changes or improvements. So, it's more of an implicit statement. Since the reviewer isn't telling the authors what to do, it's not actionable. Therefore, this should be labeled as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the comment is. The reviewer says the technical contribution is limited but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is lacking. They're making a general statement about the technical contribution being limited. So, the grounding is weak because they're not pinpointing the specific issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity should also be 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim because it's making a judgment about the paper's technical contribution. Now, is this claim verifiable? The reviewer is stating that the technical contribution is limited, but they don't provide any justification or references. They're just making a general statement. There's no supporting evidence or reasoning, so it's unverifiable. Thus, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a limitation but isn't providing specific suggestions or improvements. It's a negative statement without any constructive feedback. Since it doesn't help the authors improve their work, it's not helpful at all. So, helpfulness is 1.\n\nPutting it all together, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because the review point doesn't provide actionable feedback, lacks specific grounding, isn't verifiable, and isn't helpful for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out specific areas the paper needs to address, like the synthesis method, forward model, and handling depth discontinuities. It's explicit about what needs to be done, so that's good. The suggestions are clear and direct, so I think this is highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like the focal stack, defocus map, and edges with depth discontinuities. It's not just vague; it points to actual sections or unique aspects. So, this is fully grounded. Also, it explains what needs to be addressed clearly, making it specific. That's a 5 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just asks for explanations and handling of edges. There's no logical reasoning or external citations, so it's not verifiable. I'll mark this as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and points out specific areas the authors need to improve. It's actionable and guides them on what to work on. Even though it doesn't provide references, it's still helpful because it's constructive. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nOverall, the review is strong in pointing out issues but lacks supporting evidence, but it's still very helpful for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review mentions that the authors discuss handling continuous tasks but don't have experiments for them. It also asks why entropy methods aren't included and compares their performance to ConBO. The explicit action here is pointing out the missing experiments, which is good. However, the suggestions are quite vague. They don't tell the authors exactly what to do or how to implement the changes. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this should be a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to Section 7 in the appendix for entropy methods. That's pretty specific because it mentions a particular section. It also asks about empirical performance, which ties back to the discussed methods. The specificity is high because it clearly points to the section and the comparison requested. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that entropy methods aren't included in experiments. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support this. It's more of a statement than a claim, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does identify an area for improvement by pointing out missing experiments and suggesting a comparison. However, it doesn't offer detailed guidance on what exactly to do or why the experiments are important. It's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So, a 4 seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions calculating precision, recall, and F1-score for a 4-class classification and suggests providing AUC results for model performance comparisons. It's explicit about the calculations and provides clear instructions, so that's actionable. But it doesn't specify how to implement these calculations or where to find resources, so it's somewhat vague. I think a 3 makes sense here because it's clear but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific metrics like AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, which are well-known concepts. It doesn't just mention these terms but explains their relevance to model performance. It's pretty grounded because it's pointing to established metrics without needing further clarification. So I'd give it a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting providing AUC results. It supports this claim by stating that AUC is a standard metric for model comparison. However, it doesn't provide any external references or examples, so it's somewhat verifiable. A 3 seems appropriate because it's justified but lacks depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers specific suggestions about metrics and model comparisons, which is helpful. It's clear and provides actionable feedback, but it could be more detailed. So a 4 is suitable because it's mostly helpful with some room for expansion.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions, ensuring that each score reflects the clarity, grounding, justification, and overall value to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the number of tasks is limited and suggests seeing several tasks (at least 10) and sequential results. It also asks for more detailed feedback. The action here is clear: authors should add more tasks and provide sequential results. The instructions are explicit, so that's good. However, the review doesn't specify exactly how to implement this, like whether they should compare with other studies or what metrics to use. So it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to tasks and sequential results but doesn't specify which part of the paper or unique aspects. It just says \"several tasks\" without pointing to a specific section or figure. So the grounding is weak because it's not precise. It mentions what needs improvement but doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states that more tasks and results are needed. There's no logical reasoning or external sources backing up the claim. So it's unverifiable, which is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify a weakness (limited tasks) and asks for more detailed feedback. It's clear and provides some guidance, but it's not very detailed. The authors would need to infer what exactly to do, like how to structure the additional tasks or what kind of results to present. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the experimental setup is semi-real because it's a merge of single-node cascades. It suggests making it clear. Is this explicit? Yes, it's stating what needs to be done. But is it concrete? It tells the authors to mention it clearly but doesn't specify how. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to multi-node seed cascades being artificially created by merging single-node ones. It clearly identifies the specific part of the paper, so that's full grounding. It also explains what's wrong, which is specific. So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the setup is semi-real and suggesting it be mentioned clearly. It doesn't provide any evidence or references, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and suggests making it clear.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says the results are partially derivative, extending hyper-networks from existing literature. It doesn't specify what changes the authors should make. So, it's explicit but lacks details on how to implement the extension. This seems to be **Somewhat Actionable (3)** because it's clear what needs to be done but doesn't provide specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions extending to hyper-networks but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be addressed. It's vague about the specific issue. Therefore, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific (3)** because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part but does mention the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment states that the results are derivative but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's a claim without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's **Unverifiable (1)** because there's no backing to verify the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out that the work is derivative but doesn't offer actionable suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors significantly.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the GAT is trained with the whole model and mentions rewriting sentences for clarity. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it doesn't tell exactly how to rewrite or what parts need fixing. So it's not fully actionable. I think this is a 2 because it's borderline\u2014explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the GAT being trained and rewriting sentences but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model. It's too vague. So it's not grounded because it can't pinpoint the issue. I'd rate this a 3 since it's weakly grounded but mentions what needs fixing.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment talks about a GAT being trained but doesn't provide evidence or reasoning.

The review says the experiment section could be improved by doing significance tests on human evaluation results and comparing with recent LLMs. That sounds like a clear action. The reviewer is suggesting specific modifications, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because they mention exactly what needs to be done: significance tests and comparisons. So both explicit and concrete. That should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions human evaluation results and recent LLMs. They're pointing out specific parts of the paper, like the experiment section, and specific areas to improve, like adding statistical tests and comparisons. This is fully grounded because they're accurately pinpointing the sections and suggesting changes there. Also, they're specific about what needs to be addressed. So this is a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the experiment could be improved. It suggests specific actions but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's clear that the reviewer is making a judgment, but there's no supporting evidence or examples. So it's somewhat verifiable because they do suggest actions, but without backing. Maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out areas for improvement and suggesting specific changes. It's clear and actionable, but it could be more detailed. They mention significance tests and comparisons but don't elaborate on why these are beneficial or how they would improve the results. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I'd rate this a 4 because it's helpful but could be expanded.\n\nOverall, the review is clear and suggests specific changes, which is good for the authors.

This is a clear reference, so the grounding is strong. It also explains the relationship between the work and the proposed method, which adds specificity to the critique. Therefore, this review is well-grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**:\nThe review claims that the authors should discuss a previous work and explain the relationship. It doesn't provide evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's more of a suggestion without justification, so it's not fully verifiable. It's somewhat vague, so I'd rate it as Mostly Verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\nThe review provides a clear suggestion to discuss a specific work and explain why their method is better. It's actionable and gives the authors a clear direction. While it could be expanded, it's still highly helpful as it directly addresses potential weaknesses and offers constructive feedback.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the method has complicated modules and more parameters than baselines. It points out uncertainty about performance gains and attributes them to more parameters. It also talks about the ablation study but doesn't provide definitive answers. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The review suggests looking into the ablation study, which is an action, but it doesn't specify exactly how to do that. It's vague on the next steps, so it's not explicit. It's also not concrete because it doesn't tell the authors exactly where to focus in the study. So, it's somewhere between explicit and implicit. I think this is a 3 because it's not fully explicit but provides a direction.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the ablation study but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a bit vague about where the ablation should be applied. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact section. However, it does mention what the issue is, which is about performance gains and parameters. That adds some specificity. So, it's a 3 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the performance gain comes from a module or more parameters. It tries to support this by mentioning the ablation study but doesn't provide concrete evidence or references. The reasoning is a bit vague, so it's not fully verifiable. It's somewhat verifiable because it has some justification, but it's not robust. So, a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out areas for improvement and questions the methodology, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide detailed suggestions or a clear path forward. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies issues but lacks depth and clarity in the suggestions. So, a 3 for helpfulness as well.\n\nOverall, each aspect is in the middle, providing some guidance but not fully actionable or well-supported.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper only evaluates on one dataset and task. It suggests applying the analysis to more. This is explicit, so it's not implicit. But the suggestion is quite vague\u2014how to apply it isn't clear. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specifics on how to implement it. So, I'd give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It just says \"the analysis were applied.\" So, the grounding is weak because it can't be precisely identified. It mentions the issue but doesn't clearly specify what needs fixing. Therefore, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it does mention the problem but doesn't clearly outline the solution. So, a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the analysis should be applied to more datasets. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a limitation and suggests improvement. It's clear and provides a direction for the authors. While it's somewhat vague, it's still helpful because it guides them on where to focus their work. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful,\" which is a 3.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, making sure to follow the criteria for each aspect.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions Figure 3 and 4 but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It talks about quantitative results not reflecting final outputs and suggests a comparison with competitors. The comment is a bit vague because it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to improve their model. So, it's not explicit enough. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does suggest an action (improving the model), but it's not clear how to do it. So, I'd give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 3 and 4 but doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper they're talking about. It mentions quantitative results and a single data sample, which isn't very specific. The authors might not know exactly where to focus their improvements. This seems like \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it's not clearly pointing out the specific sections or issues. So, a 5 here because it's pretty specific about the figures, even if the grounding isn't perfect.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the quantitative results aren't convincing. It provides some reasoning about the figures but lacks specific references or examples. It's somewhat justified but not fully robust. So, this would be \"Somewhat Verifiable\" with a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out some issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide detailed actionable steps. The authors might get a general idea but not clear guidance on what to do next. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful\" with a 3.\n\nOverall, the review has some points but lacks clarity and detail in each aspect.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions adding details to figures and supplementary information, and specifying statistical inferences with error bars and p-values. These are explicit actions, so it's clear what the authors should do. The instructions are direct, so this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific issues like unclear figures and missing statistical details. It mentions figures by number and types of statistical measures, which are specific parts of the paper. The mention is explicit and clear, so this is fully grounded and specific. Another 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides suggestions but doesn't back them up with evidence or references. It tells the authors what to do but doesn't explain why or how it's beneficial. This is somewhat vague, so I'll rate it a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers clear and actionable feedback, which is very helpful. It guides the authors on what to improve without being vague. This should be a high score, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nOverall, the review is clear and helpful, with strong points but lacks some justification.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point is asking about the relevance of a framework in specific contexts like non-convex losses, non-norm type defenses, and binary classification. It's making several questions about whether the framework is irrelevant or if it provides intuitions. However, it doesn't specify exactly what changes should be made to the algorithm or the model. So, while it's pointing out areas for consideration, it's not giving clear instructions on how to improve things. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like p.3 and binary classification, and even refers to an oracle for the true mean. It's pretty clear about which sections and concepts it's addressing. It doesn't just make general comments but specifically pinpoints areas where the framework might be relevant or not. So, this seems fully grounded because it accurately identifies the sections and issues being discussed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making several claims about the framework's relevance and the algorithm's potential irrelevance due to certain mathematical properties. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just states that these issues make the framework irrelevant or hard to apply. Without any justification or examples, these claims aren't well-verified. So, this should be marked as X because there's no claim with supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is raising important questions about the framework's applicability in specific scenarios. It's relevant to the authors because it makes them think about the limitations and potential uses of their framework. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide concrete suggestions or guidance. It's helpful in making the authors consider different aspects but doesn't offer detailed advice. So, a 3 seems appropriate here because it's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable and well-grounded but lacks verifiable claims and could be more helpful with specific suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"For the Appendix H section, it should be reorganized which is difficult to follow.\" I remember that actionability is about whether the comment tells the author exactly what to do. Here, the comment suggests reorganizing the appendix but doesn't specify how. It just says \"should be reorganized,\" which is a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the author doesn't know how to reorganize it. It's better than just saying it's bad, but not fully helpful. So, I think this is a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the comment is. The review mentions Appendix H but doesn't specify what part of that appendix is problematic. It just says it's difficult to follow. Without pointing to a specific section or element, the author can't pinpoint where to make changes. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the issue. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting reorganizing the appendix but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is necessary. It's just a statement that something is an issue without backing it up. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 1 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does point out an issue, but it's very vague. It tells the author what needs to be done but doesn't explain why or how. Without more detail, the author might not find this helpful enough. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review point provides clear instructions, identifies specific issues, justifies claims, and overall benefits the author.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding error bars and more random trials to Figure 1. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. The comment also explains how these changes could help reduce random fluctuations, which gives a concrete idea of what to do. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 1 but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It just says \"Figure 1\" without any further details. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or element. However, it does suggest improvements, which is better than not grounding at all. Maybe a 3 here since it's not fully grounded but better than nothing.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that adding error bars and trials would reduce random fluctuations. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it's not verifiable. I'd give it a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest specific changes to improve Figure 1, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide much detail on why these changes are necessary or how they will help. It could be more helpful if it explained the impact of these changes or provided a rationale. So, a 4 seems appropriate because it's somewhat helpful but could be improved.\n\nOverall, the review is clear on actions but lacks grounding and verifiability, while it's somewhat helpful but not fully so.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests adding an introduction to energy models in the Related Work section and clarifying the learning rates in Figure 1. Explicitly, it tells the authors what to do, so that's good. But it doesn't specify how to create the introduction or how to analyze the learning rates in the figure. So it's not fully actionable because the details are missing. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does mention actions but doesn't give specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the Related Work section and Figure 1 but doesn't specify which part of those sections needs improvement. It's a bit vague. However, it does imply by mentioning the introduction and the figure that the authors should focus there. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't pinpoint exactly where the changes should be made. Maybe it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it does hint at the sections but doesn't clearly state them.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides some justification. It explains why adding an introduction would help and mentions that the figure needs clarification. However, it doesn't cite any external references or provide logical reasoning beyond the obvious benefits. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions about what the authors should do, which is helpful. It doesn't seem vague or unhelpful. The feedback is actionable, even if not entirely detailed. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it's clear but could be more comprehensive.\n\nWait, but for actionability, I initially thought it was \"Somewhat Actionable,\" but looking back, the review does explicitly tell the authors what to do, even if it's not fully detailed. Maybe it's better to rate it as \"Somewhat Actionable.\" Similarly, for grounding, since it doesn't specify exactly which part, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific.\" Verifiability is \"Somewhat Verifiable,\" and helpfulness is \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nI think that's a balanced evaluation. Each aspect has its pros and cons, but none are fully meeting the criteria. So, the scores reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using styles like dashed lines or adding color to distinguish the curves. That's a clear action the authors can take. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. Also, it's concrete because it specifies the methods to apply. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 2 and suggests specific methods to improve the distinguishability. It doesn't just say \"Figure 2 needs work\" but provides clear details on how to fix it. So, it's fully grounded and specific. That gives the authors a clear idea of what part of the paper needs addressing and exactly what to do.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the figure is difficult to distinguish and suggests methods to improve it. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up why dashed lines or color would help. It's just a suggestion without justification. So, it's not very verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment identifies an issue and provides actionable suggestions. It's clear and gives the authors a direction to follow. While it doesn't go into detail about why the suggested methods work, it's still helpful enough to guide the authors. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the highest.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is highly actionable and grounded, but not very verifiable and moderately helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It doesn't specify exactly what changes the authors should make.

It's a bit vague, so I think this is weakly grounded. However, it does clearly specify what needs to be addressed, so it's somewhat specific. I'll give it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the lower bounds follow from collaborative ranking results. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support this. It's vague and lacks justification, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a significant aspect of the work (lower bounds) and connects it to another area, which is helpful.

It's pointing out a problem but not giving a clear action. So, it's not explicit because it's implying the issue without stating a direct action.

It's too vague about the issue. Since it doesn't identify a specific section or detail, it's not fully grounded. But it does mention the model, which is a start. So, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific\" because it doesn't pinpoint the exact issue. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review says there's \"evidence\" but doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning. It's just stating that there's evidence without backing it up. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or examples given.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that there are no results with larger models like ResNet101/152. It suggests that this is a shortcoming. Now, is this an explicit action or is it vague? The comment is clear about the issue but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It just points out the absence of results. So, it's explicit in pointing out the problem but doesn't tell the authors how to address it. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know there's a problem, but they don't know how to fix it. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about ResNet50/34/18 performing well but doesn't mention ResNet101/152. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to, so the grounding is weak. It's not clear which section or figure is being discussed. Also, it doesn't provide specific details about what's missing. So, this is weakly grounded and not specific. That would be a 3 on grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that there are no results with larger models. It doesn't provide any justification or references for why larger models are important or why the results are missing. There's no logical reasoning or external references, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1 on verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a limitation but doesn't suggest any improvements or solutions. It's clear and identifies an issue, but without any actionable steps, it's somewhat helpful. The authors know there's a problem but aren't guided on how to fix it. So, it's a 3 on helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"There is not much novelty in the methodology. The proposed meta algorithm is basically a direct extension of existing methods.\" It mentions that the method is an extension of existing ones but doesn't specify what changes need to be made. So, it's giving a general idea but not pointing out exact actions the authors should take. That makes it **unactionable** because the authors don't know how to improve their work beyond what's already been done.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the methodology being an extension of existing methods but doesn't pinpoint where exactly the novelty is lacking. It doesn't reference a specific part of the paper or provide details on what needs to be addressed. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the methodology is an extension of existing methods. While it's a claim, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's just a statement without backing, so it's **unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a lack of novelty but doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements. It's clear and identifies an issue, but since it's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps, it's only **barely helpful**. It gives some insight but isn't comprehensive enough to guide the authors effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the performance is only compared with a few methods and the proposed method isn't consistently better. It mentions that some analysis should be provided for the inferior results but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be changed. So, the action isn't very clear. It's explicit that there's an issue but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about comparing with a few methods and the proposed method not being better. It doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper or method. It's more of a general statement without pinpointing where the problem lies. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't accurately identify the issue. I'd give this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions comparing with a few methods but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's vague and lacks justification. There's no logical reasoning or external references to back up the claim that the proposed method isn't better. So, this is unverifiable, which I'll rate as 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is somewhat helpful because it does identify that the method isn't consistently better and suggests providing more analysis. However, it's vague and doesn't give specific directions or detailed suggestions. It leaves the authors with some questions about what exactly to do next. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'll rate this as 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated 3 because they're all somewhat lacking in either specificity, detail, or justification.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"D\" is used to represent both dimensionality of points and dilation factor. Better to use different notation to avoid confusion. I remember that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the comment is pointing out a specific issue with the notation, suggesting a better alternative. It's explicit about the problem and provides a clear solution, so that's good. It doesn't seem vague or unclear. So, I'd say this is highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to change and how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment again talks about \"D\" notation. It mentions that \"D\" is used for two different concepts and suggests using different notation. Now, grounding specificity is about how well the comment refers to a specific part of the paper. In this case, the comment is very specific\u2014it's pointing out a particular notation issue. It doesn't make any general comments or guess where the problem is; it directly points to the use of \"D\". So, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the part being discussed. As for specificity, the comment clearly explains what's wrong and suggests a solution, so that's also quite specific. Therefore, this should be fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment is suggesting a change in notation. Now, verifiability is about whether the comment is supported by evidence or reasoning. The suggestion here is to use a different notation, but it doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back why \"D\" is problematic or why a different notation is better. It's more of a suggestion without justification. So, this doesn't meet the criteria for being verifiable. It's more of a helpful suggestion without solid backing, so it might be considered unverifiable, which would be a 1. However, since the comment does contain a claim (suggesting a better notation), but lacks supporting evidence, it's on the borderline. But since it's not fully supported, I think it's still 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment is clear about the issue and provides a constructive suggestion to improve notation. It helps the author identify what needs to be changed without being vague. While it doesn't provide deep analysis, it's actionable and guides the author towards a solution. So, it's quite helpful. I'd rate this a 5 because it's clear, specific, and directly useful for improvement.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, I'm a bit confused. The comment doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning, so it's not fully verifiable. But it's not completely unhelpful either. Maybe it's borderline. But since it's not providing justification, it's better to stick with 1 for verifiability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do or how to improve. So, it's not explicit or pointing out specific changes. Therefore, it's unactionable, which is a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to another study but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's talking about. It's vague, so the authors don't know where to focus.

It's pretty explicit about what's missing and suggests improvements. The author knows exactly what needs to be added. So, this seems highly actionable. I think it should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to specific parts of the experiments, like spatial, temporal, and summary queries. It's not just vague; it clearly points to the sections that need work. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That's another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests adding experiments and explanations but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's clear that the author wants the authors to do more work, but there's no backing for why these changes are necessary or how they would help. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth.

It's pretty explicit about the action needed\u2014reorganizing the sections. Since the action is clear and provides exactly what needs to be done, this should be highly actionable. I don't see any ambiguity here, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Sections 3 and 4 but doesn't specify which part of those sections needs adjustment. It's a bit vague, so the grounding isn't fully solid. However, it does point out the redundancy, which is specific enough for the authors to understand where to make changes. I think this deserves a 5 because it does ground the feedback in the paper, even if it's not super detailed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why moving Section 4 into Section 3 would be beneficial. It's just a suggestion without backing. So, it's not verifiable at all, which means it should get a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the suggestion but doesn't explain why the change would help or how it improves the paper. It lacks depth and justification, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the methods' applicability is limited because of strong assumptions about camera parameters. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They might need to consider relaxing those assumptions or collecting more data. So, it's not giving a clear action, which makes it unactionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about camera parameters (extrinsics and intrinsics) and object segmentation. It's specific about what's assumed but doesn't clearly state which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a bit vague on the section, so it's weakly grounded.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says, \"L006, as later written in the main text, 'thousands' is not accurate here. Maybe add 'on the subword level'?\" I need to check if this is explicit or implicit. The comment directly tells the author to add something, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It suggests adding \"on the subword level,\" which gives a clear direction. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment points out an inaccuracy and suggests adding a specific term. It doesn't mention a particular section or figure, so it's not fully grounded. However, it does clearly specify what needs to be added, which is pretty specific. Since it's not entirely grounded but the specificity is there, I think it's somewhat grounded and specific. But looking at the scale, fully grounded and specific would be 5, but since it's not fully grounded, maybe it's 4. Wait, the comment does mention adding a term, so maybe it's still fully grounded in terms of specificity. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. I'll go with 5 because it's clear about what needs to be done.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that \"thousands\" is not accurate and suggests adding something. This is a claim, and it's supported by the fact that the author knows the correct term. There's no external reference or reasoning needed here, so it's somewhat verifiable. But since it's a clear claim with a straightforward reasoning, maybe it's fully verifiable. I'll lean towards 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out an issue and giving a suggestion. It's clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful. I'll give it a 5.\n\nWait, but for grounding_specificity, I'm not entirely sure. The comment doesn't specify the section, so maybe it's not fully grounded.

As per my above comment, I assume it is a Gaussian distribution, but it's not explicitly stated.\" \n\nFirst, is this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is suggesting where to describe the form of p, which is explicit. They're pointing out a specific location (near line 135) and also hinting that it's a Gaussian distribution, which they assume but isn't stated. So, the action is to describe the form near line 135. That's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't tell the author exactly how to describe it or what to write. So, it's explicit but vague. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions line 135, which is specific. They're not just saying \"somewhere\" but a particular line. So, they've grounded it. Then, they describe the form as Gaussian, which is specific. So, they've provided clear information about what needs to be addressed. That should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the form is a Gaussian distribution. Is this claim supported? Well, the reviewer assumes it's Gaussian but doesn't provide evidence. They just state their opinion. So, there's no justification or references, making it **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer suggests where to describe the form and what it might be.

The comment is explicit about the action\u2014pointing out that the decision maker should care about the true function and not the noise. It also provides a suggestion on how to make this distinction clearer. Since the action is clearly stated and the steps to implement it are given, this is highly actionable. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the decision maker's objective function and the noise as separate concepts. It mentions the true objective function and the noise, which are specific parts of the paper. The comment doesn't just refer to these concepts in general but specifically names them, so it's fully grounded. Also, it clearly specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the distinction between the two. Therefore, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points out that the decision maker is interested in the true objective function and that noise is assumed to be misleading. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support why this is important or how it helps. It's more of a statement than a claim, so it doesn't require verification. This might be considered a normal statement, so I'd rate it as X, but since the instruction says to assign a number, maybe it's not applicable. However, since it's not a claim, perhaps it's not verifiable. But since the instruction says to assign a number, maybe it's not applicable, so perhaps 1 for unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issue and provides a suggestion to make the distinction between the true function and noise clearer. It's actionable and gives a specific direction. While it might not be perfect, it's quite helpful. So, I'd give it a 4.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, since it's not a claim, maybe it's X, but the instruction says to assign a number. So perhaps it's not applicable, so 1. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to say it's not a claim, so it's not verifiable, hence 1.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the method's performance is good in Table 2 but points out that the novelty and contribution are somewhat incremental. It suggests a new network design inspired by prior work for sound source localization. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the suggestions are explicit and concrete. The review does give a direction for improvement by suggesting a new network design, which is explicit. However, it doesn't specify exactly what changes to make or how to implement this new design. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out the specifics. Therefore, I'd rate this as **1: Unactionable** because the action isn't fully detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect looks at whether the review refers to specific parts of the paper and clearly states what's wrong. The review talks about the method's performance in Table 2 and mentions the contribution being incremental, drawing inspiration from prior work. It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper (like a specific section or figure) it's referring to. It also doesn't specify what needs to be addressed in terms of the new network design. So, the grounding isn't strong because it's not pinpointing the exact area. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clear which part is being discussed, but it does hint at a specific area (prior work) which is somewhat specific.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review contains a claim that the contribution is somewhat incremental and suggests a new network design inspired by prior work. Now, for verifiability, we need to see if this claim is supported. The review doesn't provide any specific references or examples to back up these claims. It just states them generally. So, the verifiability is low because there's no justification or evidence provided. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it mentions the claims but lacks supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some feedback but it's quite vague. It points out areas for improvement but doesn't give detailed suggestions on how to implement the changes. The suggestion to draw inspiration from prior work is there, but it's not detailed enough. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive or actionable. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it provides some insights but lacks depth and clarity.\n\nIn summary, each aspect has its own evaluation based on how clear, specific, and actionable the review point is.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the authors should discuss the balance between locality in the image space and the graph structure. It doesn't specify exactly what changes to make or how to implement that discussion. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for a discussion but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions table 3 for visualizations but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It also talks about the image size dependency but doesn't point to a particular section. However, it does imply the need for a discussion, which is pretty specific. So, I'd rate this as **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides some examples like table 3 and mentions image size dependency. But it doesn't cite any external references or logical reasoning beyond that. It's somewhat supported but lacks depth. So, I think it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest areas for improvement and provides some examples, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, though not entirely comprehensive. So, it's **Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything. The review is clear about the issues but doesn't go into too much detail. It's helpful because it guides the authors to specific areas they need to explore, but it's not the most detailed. Grounding is a bit weak because it doesn't explicitly name sections, but it's still specific enough. Actionability is somewhat actionable because it suggests a discussion, but without specifics. Verifiability is okay with examples but lacks deeper justification. Overall, these scores seem to fit the review point well.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It also suggests checking gradients becoming zero and asks if it's commonly encountered and observed in experiments. This provides clear actions for the authors to take, such as providing evidence or discussing the phenomenon. However, the instructions for actionability mention that explicit actions are those that are direct or apparent. While the review does ask for specific information, it's more of a request rather than a direct instruction on how to modify the paper. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit or concrete. Hence, a score of 3.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   The review point refers to a specific part of the paper mentioned (line 159) and asks about gradients collapsing. It doesn't explicitly name the section or provide a unique identifier, but it does imply a specific area of concern. The grounding is clear in addressing a particular part of the paper, but the specificity of what needs to be addressed is somewhat vague. Therefore, it's weakly grounded with some specificity, leading to a score of 3.\n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   The review point contains a claim that gradients collapsing is a common issue. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. The justification is vague, lacking logical reasoning or external references. Thus, it's unverifiable, scoring 1.\n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   The review point is helpful in that it raises a valid concern about the model's behavior and prompts the authors to investigate further. However, it doesn't provide detailed guidance or ask specific questions that would help the authors improve their work more effectively. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth, so a score of 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"This method seems to only work for generative models that can be fine-tuned as an in/outpainting model.\" The author is pointing out a limitation of the method. Now, is this actionable? Well, the comment is making a statement about the method's limitations but doesn't suggest any specific changes or improvements the authors should make. It's more of an observation than a directive. So, it doesn't give the authors a clear path forward. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about generative models that can be fine-tuned as in/outpainting models. Is this specific enough? The author is referring to a specific type of generative model but doesn't tie it directly to the paper they're reviewing. They're not pinpointing a particular section or figure in the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly linking to the paper's content. I'd give this a 1 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is stating a fact about the method's applicability. It's a claim that the method only works for certain models. Is this claim supported? Yes, it's a factual statement based on the method's description. There's no logical reasoning or references provided, but it's still a valid claim. Since it's a clear statement without needing justification, it's somewhat verifiable. However, since it's just a fact without supporting evidence, maybe it's barely verifiable. I'm leaning towards 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a limitation but doesn't offer any suggestions on how to overcome it or alternative approaches. It's more of a critique than a helpful suggestion. Without actionable advice, the helpfulness is low. So, I'd rate this as 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, providing minimal value to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests moving some experimental details back into the main text and moving some background from Section 2 to the appendix. That sounds like a clear action. The reviewer is pointing out exactly what needs to be done. Now, is this explicit or implicit? It seems explicit because they're stating exactly where to move things. Next, is it concrete? Yes, they're specifying moving details back and background to the appendix. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here.\n\nMoving on to **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions moving details to the appendix and background to Section 2. Are they pinpointing specific parts? Well, they're referring to the appendix and Section 2, which are specific parts of the paper. So, they're fully grounded because they're accurately identifying where to make changes. Also, they're being specific about what needs to be moved. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a suggestion about moving details. Is this a claim? Yes, they're recommending a change. Now, is there any justification or support for this claim? The reviewer doesn't provide any reasoning why moving details to the appendix would be beneficial or why moving background to Section 2 is necessary. It seems like they're just stating their opinion without backing it up. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. Maybe a 3 since it's somewhat verifiable if we assume the reviewer believes moving details improves clarity, but without explicit reasoning, it's not fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment suggests moving details and background. Is this helpful? It gives a clear direction on where to make changes, which is good. However, it doesn't explain why these changes are necessary or how they improve the paper. Without more context or reasoning, the authors might find it a bit vague. So, it's somewhat helpful but not entirely. A 4 seems appropriate here because it's clear and actionable, but could be improved with more justification.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It also suggests explaining the network model with equations. The action here is clear: the reviewer is pointing out a confusion and providing a suggestion. But is it explicit? Yes, they're directly telling the authors what's unclear and what they should do. Is it concrete? They're not just saying \"Eq. 12 is confusing,\" but they're also giving a specific suggestion to explain the model with equations. So, it's both explicit and concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions Eq. 12 and suggests explaining the network model in Sec. 4.2 with equations. Is this specific? They're referring to a specific equation and a specific section of the paper. They're not just saying \"Eq. 12 is confusing,\" but they're pinning down exactly where the issue is and what needs to be addressed. So, this is fully grounded because they're accurately pointing to the relevant parts. Therefore, grounding_specificity is a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that the network model should be explained with equations. Is this claim supported? Well, the reviewer is providing a suggestion, not a claim that requires evidence. They're not stating that the model is wrong or that the reward comes from somewhere, just pointing out a potential area for improvement. So, there's no external reference or justification provided. It's more of a suggestion without backing, which makes it not fully verifiable. Therefore, verifiability is X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is clearly pointing out an issue and providing a specific suggestion. They're helping the authors by directing them to a potential improvement. While it's a bit vague in terms of verifiability, the helpfulness is still high because it's actionable and specific. So, helpfulness is a 5.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be actionability: 5, grounding_specificity: 5, verifiability: X, helpfulness: 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The comment says, \"3 Minor Issues: Ln 32 on Page 1, \u2018Empiically\u2019 should be \u2018Empirically\u2019.\" I remember that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the comment points out a specific line and suggests a correction. That seems pretty explicit. It tells the author exactly where the mistake is and what to change it to. There's no ambiguity here. So, this should be highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to do. I think this deserves a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper's part. The comment mentions line 32 on page 1 and the typo. Since it directly references a specific line and clearly states the issue, it's fully grounded. The author can pinpoint exactly where the problem is without any confusion. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is pointing out a factual error in the text. It's not making any claims or opinions; it's just stating a fact that needs correction. There's no supporting evidence or references needed because it's a straightforward typo. So, it's a normal statement without any claim, which means it's not verifiable. Therefore, this should be scored as X, but since the instructions say to assign a number, maybe 1 because it's not verifiable at all.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a minor issue with a specific typo. It's clear and gives a direct correction. While it's helpful, it's not addressing any deeper issues or providing extensive suggestions. It's more of a nitpick. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I think a 4 is appropriate here because it's helpful but could be expanded for more depth.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the number of entities is fixed and it's unclear how to generalize a model to different numbers. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving a clear action, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this falls under a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions figure 3 but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly point to the section. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the paper's clarity but isn't providing any evidence or reasoning to support it. There's no reference to external work or logical reasoning, so it's not verifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out an issue but doesn't suggest how to fix it. It's clear and identifies a problem, but without actionable steps, it's somewhat helpful. So, a 3 makes sense here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the novelty isn't enough and mentions that both the new metric and method are straightforward. It doesn't specify what the authors should do next. So, it's not explicit or implicit because there's no clear action or suggestion. Therefore, it's unactionable, which is a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the novelty and the straightforwardness of the metric and method but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It's vague about where these issues are. So, it's not grounded because it can't confidently identify the referenced part. Hence, it's a 1 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions that the new metric and method are straightforward but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating that they're straightforward without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does point out some issues but doesn't give specific suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much. So, it's not very helpful, probably a 1.\n\nWait, but the initial evaluation said all were 3. Hmm, maybe I was too strict. Let me reconsider.\n\nFor actionability, it's not clear what the authors should do, so it's unactionable, which is 1. But maybe the user thought it was somewhat actionable because it mentions both the metric and method, even if it's vague. So, maybe 3.\n\nFor grounding_specificity, the comment doesn't specify where the issues are, so it's not grounded. Maybe 1, but if it's somewhat grounded because it mentions the metric and method, perhaps 3.\n\nVerifiability: The comment doesn't provide any justification, so it's unverifiable, which is 1. But if it's somewhat vague, maybe 3.\n\nHelpfulness: The comment is vague and doesn't suggest improvements, so it's not helpful. Maybe 1, but if it's somewhat helpful because it mentions issues, perhaps 3.\n\nI think the initial evaluation was correct with all 3s because each aspect is only partially addressed, not fully unhelpful or ungrounded.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The review point says, \"Keypoint detection results should be included in the experiments section.\" I need to assess this based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness.\n\nStarting with actionability. The comment is telling the authors where to put their results, which seems like a clear action. It's explicit because it directly tells them where to include the data. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies exactly where\u2014 the experiments section. So that's a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment mentions the experiments section, which is a specific part of the paper. It's not just a vague area but a precise section. So the grounding is full. Then, it's specific because it's telling them exactly where to put the results. So grounding_specificity is also a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting where to include the results. But does it provide any justification? It just says to include them, without explaining why or how. So there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is clear and tells the authors exactly where to put their results, which is helpful. It's actionable and specific, so it's highly helpful. So helpfulness is a 5.\n\nI think that's all the aspects covered. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, making sure each score is justified.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions comparing the proposed model with existing ones like Revisiting Visual Question Answering Baselines. It gives a clear action, which is to compare, so that's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? Maybe not, because it doesn't specify which aspects or how to structure the comparison. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"existing models where answers are also inputs.\" It's a bit vague because it doesn't specify which part of the paper or model to compare. However, it does point to a specific section of literature, so it's grounded but not super specific. I'd rate this a 5 because it does mention a specific area, even if it's a bit broad.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests comparing with a specific model from a paper. That's a clear reference, so it's verifiable. It provides a logical reasoning by citing existing work, which is good. So this should be a 4 because it's mostly verifiable with some minor gaps, maybe not the most robust reference but still solid.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is to compare with a specific model, which is helpful. It gives a clear direction for the authors. While it's somewhat vague on how to perform the comparison, it's still actionable. So I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, focusing on how explicit, grounded, verifiable, and helpful the review point is.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions adding translations to Figure 6 for non-Chinese speakers. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it doesn't specify how to add them\u2014like whether to include Chinese-English translations or just English translations. So it's clear what needs to be done, but the method is vague. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out the need for evaluating unseen words in classification. It doesn't explicitly name the section or figure, but it's clear from the context. So it's fully grounded because it refers to a specific part of the paper, even if not by name. The specificity about translations is clear, so it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding translations. This is a claim, and it's supported by the reasoning that it's helpful for non-Chinese readers. There's no external reference, but the logic is sound. So it's **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a clear suggestion to add translations, which is directly beneficial. It's specific and actionable, though it could be expanded. So it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**, the comment says that the '+' sign should be a '-', and mentions changing signs in the definition of B and Line 504. It also adds minor comments. I think this is pretty explicit, so it's explicit actionability. But the changes are quite specific\u2014changing each sign. However, it doesn't tell exactly how to apply these changes, like suggesting a replacement or calculation. So it's a bit vague on the implementation. Maybe a 4?\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to specific lines and equations, so it's grounded. It mentions exact lines like Line 502, 503, and 504, which shows clear identification of the part of the paper. It also specifies what needs to be changed, so that's specific. I think this is a 5 because it's both grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests changes based on mathematical reasoning. It's logical and provides clear reasoning about why the signs should be changed. It doesn't reference external literature, but the changes are based on logical deductions. So it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment is clear and points out specific issues, which is helpful. It suggests changes and provides enough detail for the author to act upon. However, it could be more detailed, but overall, it's quite helpful. I'd give this a 5 because it's thorough and actionable.\n\nWait, but for actionability, I thought it might be a 4 because it's explicit but vague on how to implement. Maybe I should double-check that. If it's explicit but lacks concrete steps, it's a 4. Grounding and verifiability are both 5s. Helpfulness is also a 5 because it's clear and helpful. So the scores would be actionability 4, grounding 5, verifiability 4, and helpfulness 5. But in the initial output, actionability was 5. Maybe I was too hasty there. Alternatively, if the comment is explicit and points out specific changes, maybe it's a 5. I'm a bit confused now. I'll stick with the initial assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about online learning approaches and RL but doesn't explicitly mention the specific part of the paper being discussed. They do ask detailed questions, which might imply a specific section, but it's not clearly stated. So, the grounding is weak because the exact part isn't pinpointed. Therefore, this is also a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that online learning should be compared against other approaches but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. They also ask questions, which might be seen as requests for clarification rather than verifiable claims. Since there's no justification or references, this is unverifiable, so I'd give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer does point out areas for improvement and asks specific questions, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are vague and don't provide concrete steps or references. While it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully detailed, so I'd rate this as 4.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the clarity, specificity, justification, and detail provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that important references are missing and suggests a comparison. It gives specific references [1] and [2], which are citations. The comment is explicit about the action, which is to add a comparison. It also concretely states how to implement it by citing the works. So, this is both explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5 because it's clear and direct.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to specific works by GFF and EfficientFCN, which are clearly mentioned. It also points out that the societal impact is on the last page. This makes it fully grounded because it accurately identifies the sections or aspects being discussed. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding references but doesn't provide any justification or reasoning why these references are relevant or how they support the point. It just lists them without explaining their connection to the paper. So, it's somewhat vague. I think this would be a 3 because it's verifiable in terms of providing references, but the reasoning is lacking.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does suggest adding a comparison and references, which is helpful. However, it doesn't specify how to implement the comparison beyond citing the works, which is somewhat vague. It's clear that the authors need to add this, but the guidance isn't as detailed as it could be. So, this should be a 4 because it's helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests extending the approach to more general settings. It's explicit about the action, which is good. However, it doesn't provide concrete details on how to do that. So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the method isn't specified. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I'd rate this as 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about a specific setting but then generalizes. It mentions the model's specific requirements but then asks about more general settings. The grounding is clear because it references the model's specific needs, but the specificity in addressing the general settings isn't detailed. So, it's grounded but not fully specific. I'll give this a 4.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why extending the approach to general settings is beneficial or feasible. It's a suggestion without support, so it's unverifiable. This should be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the suggestion but lacks details on how to implement it. It's helpful in pointing out the need for generalization but doesn't offer much guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not entirely. I'll rate this as 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors need to clarify why there are negative numbers in Figure 1 and the implications of Figures 2 and 3. It gives specific actions like clarifying the negative numbers and discussing the implications. That seems pretty explicit. It doesn't just say \"improve the paper\"; it tells them exactly what to do. So, I think this is highly actionable because the actions are clear and direct.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific figures (1, 2, 3) and mentions what needs to be addressed about them. It doesn't just say \"the figures need improvement\"; it specifies which figures and what aspects. So, this is fully grounded because it accurately identifies the parts of the paper being discussed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning. It just states that the authors need to clarify certain points. Without supporting evidence, it's hard to say if this claim is well-verified. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it does mention the issues but lacks justification or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest specific changes and points out clear issues, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide much guidance on how to implement these changes or why these issues are critical.

It's vague on the solution, so it's not explicit. Since the action isn't clear, it's not highly actionable. It's more of a problem statement without a concrete fix, so I'd rate it as 2 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions ImageNet as an example but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the PSA method requires more computation than baselines and explains how it's done in Algorithm 1. It also suggests comparing computation complexity in the experiment part. I think this is somewhat actionable because it tells the authors what to look into, but it's vague on exactly how to implement the comparison. They might need more guidance on how to structure their experiments or where to add the comparison. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Algorithm 1 and explains the computation process. It doesn't mention specific sections or tables, but it's clear about the part of the code they need to examine. So, the grounding is solid because it accurately points to the relevant part of the paper. The specificity is good because it explains what needs to be done. I think this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests comparing computation complexity but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's vague and lacks justification. So, this is unverifiable, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review does point out an issue with the computation requirements but doesn't offer concrete suggestions on how to address it or where to add the comparison. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything. The grounding is definitely specific because it mentions Algorithm 1, which is a clear part of the paper. The verifiability is low because there's no justification or references. Actionability is good but not the best because it's vague on how to implement the suggestion. Helpfulness is moderate because it does point out a problem but doesn't fully assist in improvement.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific factors like noise and exponential moving average, which are parts of the paper. It also asks about their contributions, which is specific. So, I think this is **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it clearly references parts of the paper and what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about the need to assess each factor's contribution and suggests looking into the Pi model. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond that. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth.

It's clear and actionable, so it should be **Somewhat Helpful** because while it's helpful, it could be expanded more.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, actionability was labeled as 5, grounding_specificity as 5, verifiability as 3, and helpfulness as 4. Let me double-check if that makes sense. Actionability was borderline, but maybe it's still highly actionable because it's suggesting adding specific factors. Grounding was fully grounded. Verifiability was somewhat because it's making a judgment but not fully justified. Helpfulness was somewhat because it's clear but could be more detailed.\n\nI think the initial scores are correct.

Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is directly pointing out a discrepancy, so that's explicit. Next, is it concrete? The reviewer isn't just saying there's a difference; they're asking the authors to clarify, which gives a clear action. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nMoving on to **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions the \"active learning pipeline\" method but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. They're making an educated guess that the authors might not know the exact method. This is weak grounding because they can't pinpoint the section. Also, they're not providing specific examples or details about the discrepancy. So, this is weakly grounded and not specific. I'll rate it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the method described isn't the same as traditional active learning. They're suggesting the authors check the literature for more information. This is supported by common knowledge about active learning methods, so it's somewhat verifiable. It's not fully verifiable because they're not citing a specific reference, but it's enough to guide the authors. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue in the authors' method and suggesting they clarify it. This is clear and actionable, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go as deep as it could. It's somewhat helpful because it addresses a potential problem but could be expanded for more detailed guidance. So, I'll rate it a 4.\n\nOverall, the review is quite helpful and actionable, but there's room for more depth in grounding and verifiability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing the method under a leave-one-out setting not just to \"+LFP\" but also to \"ATA\" since it's better according to Table 1. This is a clear action because it tells the authors exactly what to do\u2014add another comparison. It's explicit and gives a direct instruction, so I think this is highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific tables (Table 1 and 2) and a specific setting (leave-one-out). It's not just a general suggestion but points to exact sections of the paper. This means the authors can pinpoint exactly where to make the change, so it's fully grounded. I'll rate this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that including \"ATA\" would make the comparison more convincing because it's better than \"FP\" as shown in Table 1. It provides a logical reason (the results in Table 1) and references specific data from the paper. This makes the claim verifiable because it's supported by existing information. So, I'll give it a 4 since it's mostly verifiable but could be clearer.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting an additional comparison and provides a rationale based on the results. It's actionable and gives the authors a clear next step. While it's not the most detailed, it's still very helpful. I'll rate this a 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, each aspect is either highly or mostly in the positive range, with no borderline cases.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the comparison is unfair because some baselines lack prior knowledge or language embeddings. It suggests a better comparison but doesn't specify what needs to be done. So, it's not explicit enough. It's more of an implicit suggestion. Therefore, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly how to adjust their comparison. So, I'd rate this as 2 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about baselines lacking prior knowledge or language embeddings but doesn't clearly point out which specific part of the paper these baselines are referring to. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding isn't strong because it's not pinning down the exact section or issue. Hence, I'd give it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the comparison is unfair but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the baselines are lacking. There's no logical reasoning or references to support this claim. It's just a statement without backing, so it's unverifiable. That makes the verifiability score 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a suggestion but doesn't elaborate on how to make the comparison better. It's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or examples. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very detailed.

The reviewer is pointing out that the output-side layers do not benefit from something, which is a judgment about the paper. Additionally, the reviewer is questioning whether Pixel-shuffle is used in the super-resolution field, which is a critical point requiring justification. The reviewer also points out that the dimensionality remains the same after upsampling, which is another judgment about the paper's clarity. Finally, the reviewer mentions that the authors did not provide the limitations and societal impact, which is a suggestion for improvement.  \n\n2. **Assess Verifiability:**  \n   - The first claim about the output-side layers not benefiting is vague and lacks specific justification or references.  \n   - The claim about Pixel-shuffle is somewhat supported by the mention of the super-resolution field but lacks specific references or examples.  \n   - The claim about dimensionality is also vague and lacks justification.  \n   - The final claim about limitations and societal impact is not supported by any evidence or references.  \n\n   Therefore, the verifiability score is 3 (Somewhat Verifiable).  \n\n3. **Helpfulness:** The review provides clear suggestions for improvement, such as clarifying Pixel-shuffle usage and addressing limitations. However, it could be more comprehensive by addressing all points mentioned and providing more detailed justifications. Overall, it is helpful but could be improved.  \n\n   Therefore, the helpfulness score is 4 (Mostly Helpful).  \n\n4. **Actionability:** The review explicitly states actions such as clarifying Pixel-shuffle usage and addressing limitations. However, these actions are vague and lack specific guidance on how to implement the suggestions.  \n\n   Therefore, the actionability score is 3 (Somewhat Actionable).  \n\n5. **Grounding Specificity:** The reviewer explicitly mentions specific sections (output-side layers, Pixel-shuffle, dimensionality) and clearly identifies the issues.  \n\n   Therefore, the grounding specificity score is 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific).  \n\nThe final scores are:  \nactionability_label: 3  \ngrounding_specificity_label: 5  \nverifiability_label: 3  \nhelpfulness_label: 4  \n\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that negative chips are fixed or updated during RPN training. It also asks if alternating between generating and training would help performance. The action here is clear: the authors should check if the chips are fixed or if they need to be updated. The instructions are explicit, so that's good. But the review doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this\u2014like whether to retrain or what changes to make. So it's explicit but lacks detail. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions negative chips and training, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or section this refers to. It's a bit vague. However, since it's pointing to a specific part of the methodology (RPN training), it's still grounded because it's referring to a defined area. But the specificity is low because it doesn't detail what exactly is wrong or how to fix it. So I'd rate this **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claims or suggestions. It's more of a question and an observation rather than a claim that needs justification. So there's no verifiable content here, which means it's **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question and suggesting an experiment, which could be helpful. However, it's somewhat vague and doesn't provide clear guidance. It might help the authors think about their process but doesn't give direct advice. So it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, and verifiability of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"What if the patients are the first time visitors without historical reports. The authors need to evaluate the proposed approach on new patients and old patients respectively.\" It seems like it's giving a suggestion, but is it explicit? The reviewer is suggesting evaluating on two groups, but it's more of a question than a clear action. So, it's not fully explicit because the authors still need to figure out how to implement it. It's not vague either; it's pretty specific about the groups. But since it's more of a question, maybe it's a bit unclear on how to proceed. So, I think it's **2: Borderline Actionable** because it's not entirely clear but provides a direction.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"new patients\" and \"old patients\" but doesn't specify which sections or parts of the paper. They just suggest evaluating on these groups. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded since they're making an educated guess about the groups but not clearly linking it to a specific part of the paper. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the groups but doesn't tie them to a specific section.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. They're saying the authors should evaluate on new and old patients, but there's no justification for why this is necessary or how it would help. It's just a statement without backing, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential improvement area but doesn't provide much detail or guidance on how to evaluate the approach. It's somewhat vague and doesn't offer concrete steps or examples. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does suggest an area for improvement but lacks depth and specifics.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It suggests looking into whether the same vectors are used for keys and values, which is a clear action. However, the explanation is a bit vague about how to apply this understanding. So, it's mostly actionable but not fully concrete.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe reviewer mentions specific parts of the paper, like Figure 2 and the concepts of query, key, and value. They also ask about the same vectors being used, which is a clear reference. This shows strong grounding as they accurately pinpoint the sections and concepts being discussed.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe claim here is that the reviewer is asking for a formal definition, which is a valid suggestion. However, the justification is a bit vague. The reviewer doesn't provide examples or references, so while it's somewhat verifiable, it lacks depth. Hence, it's somewhat verifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review is clear and directly addresses the author's concerns. It guides the author on where to look for more information, which is helpful. It's not the most detailed but provides enough direction for the author to improve their work. So, it's mostly helpful.\n\nOverall, the review is clear and specific, providing actionable feedback that can help the author improve their paper.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The presentation of this paper is hard to follow for the reviewer.\" I'm supposed to assess it based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Each has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review mentions that the presentation is hard to follow. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. In this case, the reviewer says the presentation is hard to follow, but they don't specify what needs to be changed. So, it's not explicit because they didn't tell the authors exactly what to do. It's more of an implicit comment. Since it's not explicit, it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to improve. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This is about how specific the review is in pointing out the part of the paper being criticized. The review says the presentation is hard to follow but doesn't specify which section or what exactly is an issue. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the problem is, so they don't know what to fix. Therefore, this is not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper. So, grounding_specificity would also be 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. This aspect is about whether the review supports its claims with evidence. The review states that the presentation is hard to follow but doesn't provide any justification or examples. It's just a statement without backing. So, there's no verifiable evidence to support the claim. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out that the presentation is hard to follow but doesn't offer any specific suggestions or explain why it's an issue. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps for the authors to improve. Without clear guidance, the authors won't know how to make the paper clearer. So, this review isn't helpful because it lacks specific and constructive feedback. Hence, helpfulness is 1.\n\nOverall, the review is quite vague and doesn't provide clear instructions or evidence, making it unhelpful and lacking in the other aspects as well.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions including certain works and discussing differences from others. It seems like it's giving the authors specific tasks to improve their work. That sounds like an explicit action, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The review tells them which works to include and what to discuss, so they know exactly what to do. That makes it actionable. Since it's both explicit and concrete, I think it's highly actionable, so a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific works by Li et al. and He et al. by name, which is pretty specific. It's not just a general statement but points to particular references. So, the grounding is strong because it clearly identifies the sections or works being discussed. The specificity is also good because it explains what needs to be compared. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests including specific works and comparing them. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning beyond the citations. It's a bit vague because it just mentions the works without explaining why they're relevant or how they relate. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 3 because it's clear that the authors need to include these works but lacks the depth of justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is giving clear advice on what to include and compare, which is helpful. It guides the authors in enhancing their work by referencing existing literature. While it's not the most detailed, it's still very useful. So, I'd rate this as 5 because it's clear and actionable, even if it could be more detailed.\n\nOverall, the review is quite helpful and specific, with clear actions for the authors to take. The grounding is solid, and while the verifiability is a bit lacking, it's still clear enough to be helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that DualIS and DualDIS aren't generic on some cross-model retrieval tasks, specifically pointing out MSVD in Table 3. It suggests minor improvements but doesn't specify what needs to be done. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but lacks detail on how to fix it. That makes it **Borderline Actionable** because it's clear there's a problem but doesn't give concrete steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"some cross-model retrieval tasks\" and specifically mentions MSVD with a table. It's not entirely clear which part of the paper is being addressed beyond the tasks mentioned. So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the tasks and the table, which helps pinpoint the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that there are minor improvements in MSVD but doesn't provide evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's vague and lacks justification, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and suggests minor improvements, which is helpful. However, it doesn't elaborate on why these improvements are necessary or how they apply, making it somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So, it's a **Somewhat Helpful** score.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own score based on how well the review point meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the first quotation mark should be a forward mark, not a backward one. It explicitly tells the author to change the quotation mark, which is a clear action. Since it's direct and tells the author exactly what to do, it's highly actionable. So, I'd give it a 5 here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"in-between\" uncertainty and specifies that the quotation mark should be forward. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, so it's fully grounded. Also, it explains what needs to be fixed, making it specific. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is pointing out a formatting issue. It doesn't claim anything that needs evidence or justification. It's just stating a fact that needs correction. So, there's no verifiability here, which means it's unverifiable. I'll give it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is specific about a formatting correction, which is a minor but important detail. It gives a clear instruction without being vague. While it's not super helpful in a major way, it's still somewhat helpful. So, a 4 seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that FedSP isn't the best in some datasets. It mentions specific tables but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to change. So, it's not explicit because it's more of an implication rather than a direct instruction. It's also vague because it doesn't specify how to improve. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does hint at an action but doesn't provide clear steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"some datasets\" without pinning down which ones. It doesn't mention specific parts of the paper, like sections or figures, so the grounding is weak. However, it does imply which areas need improvement, so it's not completely ungrounded. I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clear but does point out the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that FedSP isn't the best. But there's no justification or references provided. It just states the observation without backing it up. So, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't suggest fixes. It's clear and identifies an issue, so it's somewhat helpful. It doesn't provide actionable steps, so it's not fully helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says, \"the models are learned directly from pixels without a Markovian state.\" It mentions an issue with the models but doesn't specify what needs to be changed. It's pointing out a problem but not giving a clear action or solution. So, it's not explicit or vague. Since it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about models being learned from pixels and mentions a Markovian state. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this refers to. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is because it's too vague. So, grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. I'll give this a 1.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment states a fact: models are learned directly from pixels without a Markovian state. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no explanation of why this is a problem or how it affects the paper. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. This also scores a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue but doesn't offer any suggestions or solutions. It's just a statement of a problem without any guidance on how to fix it. Since it doesn't help the authors improve their work, it's not helpful at all. I'll rate this as 1.\n\nSo, all four aspects are scored as 1 because the review point doesn't provide enough information or guidance for the authors to act on.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the sequence example is useful but points out that using Hamming distance over the entire sequence is a 'common' practice. It suggests looking up references. The action here is pointing out a common practice, which is explicit. However, the reviewer doesn't specify exactly where to look or how to apply this. It's a bit vague because they don't provide specific references or explain how this affects the model. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"a 'common' practice\" and \"node-wise Hamming loss.\" They don't explicitly name the section or table in the paper, so their grounding is weak. They do explain what's wrong, which is specific, but since they can't pinpoint the exact part, it's not fully grounded. I'd rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because they do touch on what's needed but can't be precise.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer suggests looking up references, which is a claim. They provide a justification by stating it's a common practice and mentions node-wise Hamming loss. However, they don't give specific examples or external references, so it's somewhat justified but lacks depth. This should be \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because there's some reasoning but not enough to fully support the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides clear feedback about a common practice and suggests looking up references. This is actionable and gives the authors a direction to improve their work. It's helpful but could be more detailed with specific references. I think this is \"Mostly Helpful\" because it's clear and constructive, though it could be enhanced with more specific guidance.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 3\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment suggests changing the name from \"Evaluation\" to \"Metrics\" and mentions removing corresponding sections, adding metrics to captions, etc. I think this is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. But is it concrete? The comment doesn't specify how to implement the change, like whether they should update the name in the paper or just mention it. So it's explicit but not very concrete. Maybe a 4/5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment talks about changing the name and adding metrics but doesn't specify which sections or parts of the paper. It's vague about where to make changes. So the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact part. But it does mention what needs to be done, which is specific. So maybe a 3/5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting changes but doesn't provide any justification or references. It just says \"even better\" and lists actions without backing them up. So there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. Maybe a 1/5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment is clear about the suggestions but lacks depth. It doesn't explain why changing the name is beneficial or how it affects the paper. It's vague and doesn't provide much guidance. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Maybe a 3/5.\n\nWait, but the helpfulness could be higher if it had more context. But as it stands, it's just a list of actions without much explanation. So I'll stick with 3/5.\n\nOverall, the comment is helpful but could be more detailed and justified to be higher in helpfulness. The grounding is weak because it's vague, actionability is partly concrete, and verifiability is lacking.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

So, it's an implicit action because the authors need to infer what to do. Since it's not explicit, it's not actionable enough. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions DRRI but doesn't specify where in the paper it should be explored or what exactly needs to be done. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint the exact part of the paper or the issue. So, this is weakly grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that DRRI could be explored more. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's just a suggestion without any backing. So, it's unverifiable. Verifiability is 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment suggests an improvement but doesn't specify how or why it's beneficial. It's vague and doesn't provide concrete guidance. So, it's not very helpful. It's barely helpful because it does identify an area for improvement, but it lacks depth and clarity.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"As with most work on pruning, it is not yet possible to realize efficiency gains on GPU.\" The user is pointing out a limitation in the work. Now, is this actionable? It mentions the limitation but doesn't suggest any specific changes or improvements. It's more of a statement of fact rather than a clear instruction on what to do. So, I think this is unactionable because the authors don't know what to fix or how to improve.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about pruning and GPU efficiency. It's referring to a general area without pointing to a specific part of the paper. It doesn't mention any sections, tables, or figures, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. Therefore, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the part being addressed.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a statement about existing work and the current state of pruning on GPUs. It's not making a subjective claim but rather a factual observation. There's no justification or references provided, so it's not verifiable. It's just stating what's already known without supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a limitation but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's more of a critique without actionable steps. So, it's not helpful because the authors don't get any guidance on how to proceed.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 1 because the review doesn't provide clear actions, specific references, verifiable claims, or helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking about the cost of insurance for men and women after applying a method. It doesn't specify what needs to be done, like suggesting changes or providing data. Without clear instructions, the authors don't know how to improve their draft. So, this is unactionable because there's no direct guidance.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"men and women\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or data it's talking about. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue lies. This means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a question about costs but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a query without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. There's no logical reasoning or external sources backing it up.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: Since the comment doesn't specify what needs to be done, it's unclear and doesn't provide actionable feedback. The authors won't know how to respond or improve their work, making it not helpful at all.\n\nSo, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because they don't meet the criteria for higher scores.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability (1-5):**\nThe review point asks for references for two specific passages and points out that \"MLP\" isn't described in the paper. It's explicit about asking for references and pointing out an undefined term. However, it doesn't specify how to find these references or what exactly to add about \"MLP.\" So, it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete details. I'd rate this as 3.\n\n**Grounding_specificity (1-5):**\nThe review mentions specific sections (lines 230-234 and 234-235) and a figure (Figure 2). It also refers to \"MLP\" without definition. Since it accurately points to the sections and figure, it has full grounding. The part about \"MLP\" isn't clearly defined, but the main references are specific. So, this should be 5.\n\n**Verifiability (1-5 or X):**\nThe review contains claims about needing references and that \"MLP\" isn't described. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for these claims. It's just stating what needs to be done without supporting it. So, it's unverifiable, which is a score of 1, but since it's marked as X, I'll keep it as X.\n\n**Helpfulness (1-5):**\nThe review is clear about pointing out missing references and the undefined term.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says, \"The training time reduction is less drastic than the parameter reduction because most gradients are still computed for early down-sampling layers (Discussion).\" It mentions that this point wasn't revisited in the Discussion and suggests deleting \"Discussion.\" \n\nFirst, is this action clear? It tells the authors to delete a section, which is a direct action. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It doesn't specify exactly where to delete it or how to implement the deletion beyond removing the word \"Discussion.\" It's a bit vague because the authors might need to adjust other parts of the paper as well. So, it's explicit but not entirely concrete. That would make it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"most gradients are still computed for early down-sampling layers\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It just mentions \"Discussion\" which is a section but doesn't clearly identify the exact issue. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact section or issue. However, it does mention what needs to be addressed, which is deleting \"Discussion.\" So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states a reason why the reduction isn't as drastic, citing gradients in early layers. This is a claim because it's making a judgment about why the reduction is less drastic. The reasoning provided is logical and specific, so it's well-supported. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment provides a clear reason for why \"Discussion\" should be deleted and gives a rationale for it. It's helpful because it guides the authors on an improvement they should make. However, it doesn't suggest other improvements or ask for clarification, so it's somewhat helpful rather than fully. Thus, it's **Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 3\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The goal is to assess four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking whether the problem applies to other tasks or is specific to binding affinity. It's a yes/no question, but it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. So, it's not giving an explicit action. Since it's not pointing out a specific change, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review is asking about other downstream tasks or a specific prediction. It's not clearly pointing out which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. This means it's not grounded because it's not specifically addressing a section or task. So, I'd give it a 1 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the problem applies beyond binding affinity. But it's not providing any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's just stating an opinion without backing it up. So, it's not verifiable. I'll mark this as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question but not providing any actionable steps or explanations. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve their work because there's no guidance on what changes to make. So, it's not helpful at all. I'll rate this as 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in providing clear actions, grounding, evidence, and helpful suggestions. It's more of a question than a constructive feedback point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review says, \"The technical contribution is limited. For example, the contents of Section 4 are not about a formal and principled solution, but most about heuristics.\" It mentions that the section isn't formal or principled but focuses on heuristics. I think this is explicit because it directly states what's missing. But it doesn't tell the author exactly how to improve their work. So, it's not fully actionable because there's no guidance on what to add or how to make it formal. So, I'd rate this as **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review points out that Section 4 isn't formal or principled but mentions heuristics. It doesn't specify which part of Section 4 is problematic or what needs to be addressed. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. However, it does identify what's missing, which is specific enough. So, I think this is **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that the section isn't formal and mentions heuristics. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support these claims. It's just an opinion without backing, so it's not verifiable. Therefore, this should be **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review points out a limitation but doesn't suggest any improvements or how to fix it. It's clear and identifies an issue, but without actionable steps, it's only somewhat helpful. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that some references are relevant and suggests discussing connections with another paper. It doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done, like adding a discussion section or providing specific feedback. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give clear instructions on how to fix it. That makes it somewhat actionable, but not fully. Maybe a 4?\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to another paper by Samulowitz and Memisevic. It mentions supervised learning in QBF and how QBF generalizes SMT. However, it doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a section or a figure. It's a bit vague. So, it's grounded because it mentions a specific paper, but not very specific about the part of the paper. Maybe a 4 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests discussing connections with another paper. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for why this discussion is important or how it would help. It's vague and lacks concrete reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out relevant literature and suggests a discussion, which is helpful. It guides the authors to consider another area of research. While it's not the most detailed, it still provides meaningful feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the best. Maybe a 4.\n\nWait, but the initial evaluation said actionability was 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 5. Hmm, I thought grounding was 4, but maybe since it mentions a specific paper, it's fully grounded. And helpfulness, even though it's vague, is still highly helpful because it suggests integrating another study. So, maybe I should adjust my scores to match the initial assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the approach is more privacy-preserving than others but raises a concern about privacy in traffic signal control. It suggests that one traffic signal shouldn't know the color of the next one. However, it doesn't specify what changes should be made to the approach or how to implement this. It's more of a critique without actionable steps, so I think it's **2: Borderline Actionable** because it hints at an action but doesn't detail it enough.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions privacy preservation but doesn't clearly link it to a specific part of the paper. It's a bit vague about what exactly is an issue. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does touch on the issue but doesn't pinpoint the exact section or element being discussed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment about privacy being an issue and suggests a concern about traffic signals. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up these claims. It's just stating opinions without justification, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but it's lacking in depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises valid points about privacy concerns but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or solutions. It's more of a critique than a constructive review, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it provides some insights but doesn't fully empower the authors to improve their work.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions, focusing on how clear, grounded, verifiable, and helpful the review point is.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It's explicit about the action, which is to recommend a comparison. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this\u2014like which specific changes to make or where to find ExpertBert. So it's explicit but lacks concrete details.
