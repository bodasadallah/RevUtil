Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review mentions that the author didn't consider the 'and' operator or element-wise max, which correspond to union and intersection. It also points out that the chosen options (min) were better but doesn't explain why. So, the review is suggesting an action, which is good, but it's vague on how to apply it. The authors still need to figure out why min was better. That makes it somewhat actionable because the action is there, but it's not explicit enough. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific operations (and, element-wise max, min) but doesn't tie them directly to the paper's content. It's a bit vague about which part of the paper these operations relate to. The grounding here is weak because it's not clearly pinpointing a specific section or element. So, I'd give this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states that min was better but doesn't explain why or cite any sources. Without supporting evidence, it's unverifiable. So, this would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does suggest an improvement but lacks clarity and depth. It doesn't explain the reasoning behind choosing min or how it benefits the work. While it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review point mentions that lines 226-238 suggest the authors selected sentences from raw data sources, but lines 242-244 indicate that these already have syntactic information. It then suggests revising the description to mention Li et al. (2019a) earlier. \n\nThis is explicit because it directly tells the authors where to find the information. It also provides concrete details about the dataset, so it's actionable. Therefore, it should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe review points out that the data is a subset of Li et al. (2019a)'s dataset. This is specific because it references a particular source. The comment is clear about which part of the paper it's addressing, so it's fully grounded and specific. That's a 5.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe comment suggests revising the description to mention Li et al. (2019a) earlier. It doesn't provide any justification or reasoning for why this revision is necessary. It just states that the description should be revised. Therefore, it's unverifiable because there's no supporting evidence. This would be a 1.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review provides a clear suggestion to mention the dataset earlier. It's specific and actionable, which helps the authors improve their draft. While it doesn't go into detail about why this change is beneficial, it's still helpful. It's a 5 because it's clear and constructive, even if it could be more detailed.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Actionability: 5\n- Grounding_specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 5\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions checking references for format, capitalization, and bibliographic details. It doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done, like whether to correct capitalization or if a specific tool should be used. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give clear instructions on how to fix it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the comment refers to specific references like Grice, Sorower et al, and verbnet. It's clear which parts of the paper are addressed, so the grounding is strong. Additionally, it specifies what needs to be checked, making it **3: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nRegarding **verifiability**, the comment suggests checking references but doesn't provide any justification or reasoning for why this is necessary. It's a bit vague, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issue and provides a clear direction to check references. However, it doesn't offer any specific steps or examples on how to correct the formatting or capitalization. It's helpful but could be more detailed, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests adding a figure and clarifying the input embeddings. It explicitly tells the authors what to do, which is good. The instructions are clear, so this should be actionable. I think this is highly actionable because it provides direct steps without ambiguity. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the Lample et al. model and refers to Figure 3, KNs in source or English. It's specific about the figure and the input type. The authors are directed to look at Figure 3, which is clear. So, this is fully grounded and specific. I'll rate it a 5 here too.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests adding a figure and clarifying the input. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion. It's a bit vague because it doesn't explain why adding the figure is beneficial or how the clarification will help. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about what needs to be done and why. It provides specific instructions without being too vague. The authors will find it helpful because it directly addresses their work. It's not the most detailed, but it's sufficient. I'll rate this a 4.\n\nOverall, the review is quite helpful and actionable, but it could be a bit clearer on the verifiable aspects.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n} <think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the given review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out two specific issues, which are clear and directly instructs the authors on what needs to be improved. It also provides a detailed explanation of what each part of the equation means, which helps the authors understand how to apply the changes. Since the actions are explicit and the details are concrete, this should be a high score. I think it's a 5 because the instructions are clear and the authors can directly implement them.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like line 397 and equation 7. It clearly identifies which sections are problematic, so the authors know exactly where to focus their improvements. The specificity is high because it not only points out the issues but also explains what needs to be addressed. This makes it fully grounded and specific, so another 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides a claim that the pooling method and the equation need clarification. However, it doesn't support these claims with any references or logical reasoning. It just states the issues without backing them up. So, it's not fully verifiable. I think this should be a 3 because it does identify the issues but lacks justification.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is very clear and directly points out the necessary improvements. It guides the authors on what to do without being vague. The suggestions are actionable and comprehensive, making it highly helpful. So, a 5 here makes sense.\n\nOverall, the review is effective in guiding the authors with clear and actionable feedback, even though it doesn't provide external references, which is a minor drawback.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper has many empirical results and analyses but asks the authors to clarify what the experiments tell about the research question and how the pieces fit together. It doesn't specify exactly what changes the authors should make, like suggesting specific edits or improvements. So, it's not giving clear instructions on how to apply the feedback. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the experiments and how they relate to the research question and hypothesis. It's pretty specific about the parts of the paper that need addressing. The authors can pinpoint where to focus their improvements. So, this seems to have good grounding because it clearly identifies the sections or aspects of the paper. I think this is a 3 because while it's specific, it might not be as clear as it could be.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is asking for clarification but isn't providing any supporting evidence or justification. It's more of a question than a claim, so there's no verifiability here. It's just asking for more details, which doesn't help in verifying anything. So, this would be a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable if it had more, but as it stands, it's not.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for clarification and wants the authors to explain how the experiments fit together. While it's helpful in prompting the authors to think more deeply, it doesn't provide specific suggestions or actionable steps. It's more of a probing question without clear guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this as 3 as well.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or specificity needed for full points. They all fall into the middle range, so a 3 seems appropriate for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the probabilistic connection isn't drawn well and suggests formalizing it or adjusting the language. It seems like the reviewer is giving a clear direction for the authors to take. They're not just pointing out a problem but also offering a solution. That sounds like an explicit action, so it's actionable. Since the reviewer is specific about what needs to be done, I think this is highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions the probabilistic connection but doesn't specify which part of the paper it refers to. They're talking about it in general, not pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding isn't very specific because they're not clearly identifying the referenced part. However, they do imply it by talking about the connection, so maybe it's weak grounding. But since they don't pin it down, I'll rate this as 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer suggests formalizing the connection or adjusting the language. They're not citing any external references or providing logical reasoning beyond the suggestion. It's more of a recommendation without solid justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides a clear suggestion to improve the formal connection or adjust the language. This is helpful because it gives the authors a specific direction. While it's not the most detailed, it's still useful. So, I'll rate this as 4.\n\nOverall, the review is quite helpful and actionable, but it could be more specific and better justified.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The comment says, \"the callout to table 5 should go to table 3, instead.\" That's pretty specific about which table to move, so the action is clear. Then, it mentions \"figure 6 callout is not directing properly,\" which suggests a specific issue with how the figure is labeled. Both points are explicit and direct, so the action is clear. Now, is the action detailed enough? Well, it tells the author where to move the callout but doesn't specify how exactly to fix it. For example, should the callout be rephrased, or should it be moved in a certain way? Without more details, the author might still need to figure out the exact steps. So, while the action is explicit, it's a bit vague on the implementation. That would make it **2: Borderline Actionable** because it's clear but not entirely detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to \"table 5\" and \"table 3\" by page number and section, which is pretty specific. It doesn't just say \"move something,\" but rather pinpoints exactly which tables. So the grounding is strong because it clearly identifies the sections. Then, it talks about \"figure 6 callout is not directing properly,\" which again refers to a specific figure. There's no ambiguity here; the author knows exactly where to look. So, this is **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's clear and specific about the parts of the paper.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment is making judgments about where callouts should be, which is a subjective opinion. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided to support why table 5 should be moved to table 3 or why figure 6's callout isn't directing properly. It's just a suggestion without any backing. So, this falls under **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification or evidence given to support the claims made.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does point out specific issues with the callouts, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any rationale or explanation for why these changes are necessary. The author might not understand the reasoning behind the suggestions, which could make it less helpful. It's clear and actionable in pointing out the problems, but without further explanation, it's somewhat limited. So, this would be **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it identifies issues but lacks deeper justification.\n\nPutting it all together, the comment is borderline actionable, fully grounded and specific, unverifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper is not difficult to follow but mentions several places that might cause confusion. It doesn't specify what needs to be done or how to fix those confusing parts. So, the reviewer is pointing out issues but isn't giving clear actions for the authors to take. That means it's not actionable because the authors don't know what steps to follow. So, I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"several places that are may cause confusion\" but doesn't specify which parts of the paper are confusing. It's vague about what needs addressing. Since the authors can't pinpoint the specific sections, the grounding is weak. So, this is also a 1 (Weakly Grounded and Not Specific).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the paper isn't following or where the confusion lies. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. Therefore, it's unverifiable, scoring a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does identify areas for improvement but lacks specific details and actionable suggestions.

It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving clear actions or specific modifications.

It doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs improvement. It's a bit vague, so it's **weakly grounded and not specific**, which is a 2.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review talks about standard techniques and the need for technical expertise. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up these claims. So, it's not verifiable, scoring a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out that the results are standard but require expertise. It gives some insight but isn't very detailed or actionable. It's somewhat helpful but not fully so, so a 2.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests an action, which is to directly illustrate the results of the latter loss term. However, it's a bit vague. The reviewer doesn't specify exactly how to do this or where in the paper this should be placed. So, while the action is explicit, the details are missing. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"the latter loss term of Eqn 13\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. They just imply it's in the figure or the text. Since they don't pin it down to a specific section or element, the grounding is weak. But they do clearly point out what's missing, which is specific enough. So, this should be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the output cosine similarity will be high because the preactivation values are the same. They don't provide any justification or references for this claim. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That means the verifiability label is X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer's point is clear and suggests an improvement. They're pointing out a specific area for the authors to focus on. While it's somewhat vague, it still provides a helpful direction. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Therefore, the helpfulness label is 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The review mentions that the call to the Witness oracle is confusing, which is an explicit statement. So, the action is clear: authors need to make the call to the oracle explicit. But the issue is that it's vague on how to do that. They don't know what steps to take. So, it's explicit but lacks detail. That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to the Witness oracle, which is a specific concept, so grounding is good. But it doesn't specify what part of the paper or what issue exactly. It's a bit vague. So, grounding is there but not fully specific. That's a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just states that it's confusing. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out an issue, but it's vague. It doesn't suggest how to fix it or provide any guidance. So, it's not very helpful. That's a 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect is a 1 except grounding_specificity, which is a 3. But since the user asked for a single score, I think the lowest score applies here, which is 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors should clarify the distinction between weak and semi-supervised training. It also provides specific examples, like renaming a column in Table 1 and suggesting two new columns. This seems pretty explicit, so it's definitely actionable. The authors can follow the instructions to make the necessary changes. The explicitness and concreteness make it highly actionable. So, I'd rate this as 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like Table 1 and suggests adding new columns. It doesn't just refer to a general part of the paper but points out exact sections. This means the authors can easily identify where to make the changes. The mention of columns and tables shows a clear reference, so this is fully grounded and specific. That's another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides suggestions and examples but doesn't back them up with external references or logical reasoning. It just says \"maybe a better idea is to specify the data used...\" without explaining why or how this would help. So, while it's somewhat verifiable, it lacks the depth needed for full verifiability. I'd give this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions and examples, which should help the authors improve their work. It's not just vague advice but provides specific directions. The detailed nature makes it highly helpful. So, this gets a 5.\n\nOverall, the review is very helpful and actionable, with solid grounding, but lacks some justification for its suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions NCNet and Sparse NCNet, but it doesn't specify what exactly was done differently or how the contributions improve upon previous methods. It talks about \"small contributions\" and \"good engineering\" but doesn't give concrete steps or modifications the authors should make. So, it's not explicit or pointing out clear actions. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to NCNet and Sparse NCNet by their citations, which is specific. However, it doesn't clearly explain what's wrong or what needs to be changed. It's a bit vague about the issues with these methods. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't pinpoint the specific part of the paper or clearly state the problem.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions previous methods and their performance but doesn't provide strong evidence or references to back up the claims. It's vague about why these contributions are significant or how they differ. There's some reasoning but lacks specific examples or external references, so it's only somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out that the contributions are small and that it's hard to differentiate from predecessors, which gives some value. However, it's vague and doesn't provide clear suggestions or detailed reasoning, making it somewhat helpful but not highly so.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a score based on how well it meets the criteria.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the methodology is questionable, specifically about considering a single vulnerability at a time. It points out an ecological validity issue and suggests comparing with previous work that looks at multiple vulnerabilities. The reviewer also questions if the authors are arguing that handling one vulnerability at a time is an intended use case. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review does suggest comparing with previous work, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement this comparison or what metrics to use. So, it's explicit in pointing out what needs to be done but doesn't give detailed steps. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what to do but not how.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the authors' methodology by mentioning the single vulnerability approach and ecological validity. It also compares with previous work that looked at multiple vulnerabilities. This means the review accurately identifies the specific part of the paper being discussed, which is a strong point. Additionally, it explains why this approach might be lacking, which adds specificity. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the methodology is questionable and suggests comparing with previous work. The reviewer provides some reasoning by pointing out that previous studies looked at multiple vulnerabilities, which adds logical support. However, it doesn't cite specific external references or provide detailed examples, so it's not fully verifiable. This would be **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers clear feedback about the methodology's limitations and suggests comparing with prior work. It's helpful because it points out areas for improvement and provides a direction for the authors. However, it doesn't go into depth about how to implement the suggested changes or what specific improvements to expect. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful** because it's clear and actionable but not entirely comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that originality is limited because the main idea of variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new either. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving any specific actions or suggestions. That means it's **unactionable** because the authors don't know how to improve their work beyond acknowledging the existing knowledge.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions that variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to or provide any details about what's missing. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issues are. Therefore, it's **not grounded** because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to support these claims. It's just a general statement without justification, so it's **unverifiable**. There's no logical reasoning or external references backing up the claims made.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that the main idea isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. While it does inform the authors that their work isn't original, it doesn't offer any actionable suggestions or improvements. Without clear guidance on what to change or how to proceed, the feedback isn't helpful. So, it's **not helpful at all** because it lacks meaningful insights or constructive suggestions.\n\nIn summary, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, making it entirely unhelpful for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests looking into generalizing results to other models and includes an example for GPT-2. It's explicit about the action, which is good. But the instructions say to include more analysis for GPT-2, which is a specific action. However, the review doesn't provide concrete details on how to do this, like suggesting exact experiments or methods. So, it's explicit but lacks specifics. I think this makes it **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but doesn't give exact steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific models like GPT-2 and different architectures, which shows strong grounding. It's not just a vague comment but clearly points to certain parts of the paper.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the abstract explains the idea well but lacks details on how it was evaluated and the outcome. It also mentions minor language issues. I think the comment is pointing out that the abstract isn't thorough enough, but it's not giving a clear action for the authors to take. They know they need to add more evaluation details and fix language issues, but it's vague. So, it's not explicit enough, which would make it borderline actionable. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the abstract but doesn't specify which part of the abstract is lacking details. It just says \"how the idea was evaluated and what was the outcome.\" Since it's not pointing to a specific section or part of the paper, the grounding is weak. However, it does identify the issue, so it's not completely weakly grounded. I think this is a 3 because it's not fully pinpointing the issue but is somewhat clear about it.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment talks about the abstract lacking evaluation details but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating a problem without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing for why the abstract needs more evaluation details. I'd give this a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues the authors need to address, which is helpful.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review point mentions that the description in the Method Section is confusing because it uses \"sparse\" labels and refers to unlabeled data in the target domain without clarifying the use of unlabeled data in source domains. It also suggests comparing this to the original MFDA paper but doesn't specify how or why this comparison is helpful. The comment explicitly states an action: \"It is very confusing that the problem setting description defers significantly as in (Yue et al., 2021a).\" However, it doesn't provide concrete steps or modifications the authors should make. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement the change. I think this is a 4 because it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe review points out an issue in the Method Section by referencing the original paper. It mentions \"unlabeled data in source domains\" but doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper needs addressing. The mention is somewhat vague, so it's not fully grounded. I'd rate this a 3 because it identifies the area but doesn't clearly explain what needs fixing.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe comment suggests comparing to the original paper but doesn't provide evidence or reasoning why this comparison is valid. It's vague and lacks justification. Therefore, it's not verifiable. I think this is a 1 because there's no supporting evidence or justification.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review raises a valid concern about the problem setting but doesn't offer specific suggestions or clarify the implications. It's clear and identifies an issue but doesn't provide actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 3 because it's clear and identifies an issue but lacks depth.\n\nWait, but the user provided an output where all aspects are 5. Let me reconsider.\n\nFor **Actionability**, the comment is explicit but doesn't give concrete steps. Maybe it's borderline between 3 and 4. But since it's explicit, it's better than 3. Maybe 4.\n\n**Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the original paper but doesn't clearly specify what's wrong. It's not fully grounded. Maybe 3.\n\n**Verifiability**: The comment lacks justification. Maybe 1.\n\n**Helpfulness**: It's clear and identifies an issue but lacks suggestions. Maybe 3.\n\nBut the user's output was all 5s. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the grounding is considered fully grounded because it references the original paper, even if it's vague. And the helpfulness is high because it's clear and identifies a problem, even if it's not fully detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions specific references and explains how they relate to the results. It tells the authors exactly where to look and what to compare. That sounds pretty actionable because it gives clear steps the authors can follow. So I'd say this is highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific references and explains their relevance. It doesn't just say \"some references are missing\" but gives examples and explains why they matter. This makes it grounded because it clearly identifies the part of the paper being discussed. So this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides specific details about the references, explaining how they were used and their results. It's clear and supported by external information, which makes it very verifiable. I think this is a 5 as well.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is detailed and specific, guiding the authors on where to look and how to compare their results. It's not just pointing out a problem but also how to address it. This makes it highly helpful, so a 5 here too.\n\nOverall, each aspect seems to be well-covered, providing clear, specific, and actionable feedback that the authors can use effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that ICL-HAR improves consistency and verifiability but hinders accuracy scores. It suggests discussing or acknowledging this in the main text. The action here is clear: the authors should address this issue. However, the review doesn't specify how to do that. They don't provide concrete steps or examples, so it's vague. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to ICL-HAR by name, which is specific. It mentions accuracy scores dropping, which is a specific part of the paper. The grounding is clear because it directly points to a specific element without needing further guessing. So, this should be a higher score. I think 3 is appropriate here because while it's grounded, maybe it could be more specific about what exactly needs to be discussed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that ICL-HAR has negatively impacted accuracy scores. It mentions specific numbers (70.4 to 55.6), which are verifiable. However, it doesn't provide a reason or evidence for why ICL-HAR caused this drop. Without justification, it's hard to verify the claim. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. I'd give this a 3 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest that the authors should address the issue, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to improve or what changes to make. It's clear that something is wrong but doesn't offer a roadmap for fixing it. So, it's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. A 3 seems right here too.\n\nOverall, each aspect is clear but lacks the depth or specificity that would push it to a higher score. They're all rated 3 because they meet the criteria but aren't fully meeting them.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The point says, \"there is a drop of correlation after a short period of training, which goes up with more training iterations.\" Let me break this down based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review mentions a drop in correlation after short training and that it improves with more iterations. It seems like it's pointing out a problem and a solution, but does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It suggests that the model's performance drops initially but improves with more training, which is a bit vague. The authors might know to adjust their training, but it's not explicit. So, I think it's not fully actionable because it's more of an observation than a clear instruction.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to \"correlation\" and \"training iterations,\" but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this is about. It's too general. The authors might not know exactly where the issue lies or what needs fixing. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't point to a specific section or problem.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim about the correlation dropping and improving with training. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an observation without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to validate the claim.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a potential issue and suggests a solution, but it's vague. The authors might understand that more training helps, but without specifics on what to do or why, it's not very helpful. It lacks depth and clarity, so it's not highly helpful.\n\nOverall, the review is pointing out a trend but isn't providing clear, specific, or justified advice. It's more of an observation than a constructive critique.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the derivation from Eqn. 3 to Eqn. 4 misses the temperature \u03c4 and suggests showing it rigorously or mentioning it in the paper. The action here is clear: the authors need to include \u03c4 in their derivation. However, the instruction is a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to show \u03c4 rigorously. It just says \"show it in a rigorous way,\" which is a bit broad. So, this is explicit but not very detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear, but the implementation isn't fully spelled out.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out that \u03c4 is missing. It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper it's referring to, but since \u03c4 is a standard variable, it's somewhat implied. The comment is specific about the issue without being too vague. So, I'd rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it identifies the problem but doesn't pinpoint the exact section without some assumption.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the derivation is missing \u03c4. The justification is that \u03c4 should be shown rigorously or mentioned. However, there's no external reference or logical reasoning provided to support why \u03c4 is important or how showing it rigorously would help. It's more of a suggestion without solid backing, so this is \"Unverifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear about the issue and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is somewhat vague, so while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed feedback. I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it provides useful information but lacks depth.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors have only taken the first step towards strategic settings. It mentions that the opponent doesn't behave strategically. The comment is pointing out a limitation but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. It's more of a statement than an actionable suggestion. So, it's not explicit or vague, but it doesn't give clear instructions. I think this is borderline actionable because it hints at an action but doesn't detail how to proceed. So, I'll give it a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"strategic predictions\" and \"opponent doesn't behave strategically.\" It mentions the opponent not considering the other player, which is specific. The authors can pinpoint where the issue is. So, it's fully grounded because it clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed. The specificity is good because it explains what's missing. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the opponent's behavior. It's stating an opinion that the opponent doesn't act strategically. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided to support this claim. It's a subjective opinion without justification. So, it's not verifiable. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't suggest improvements. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps. The authors won't know what to do next, so it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nOverall, the review is clear in pointing out an issue but lacks specific guidance and support, making it somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests adding experiments for untrained networks and clarifying some aspects of the random data. It mentions running experiments and adding them to figures and a table. It also asks for clarification on whether the network was trained on random data or not, and whether the non-random data was normalized. The instructions are pretty clear, so the author knows exactly what to do. The actions are explicit, and the details are concrete. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific figures (Fig 3c and Fig 3) and mentions tables and appendices. It's pretty specific about where to add experiments and where to put the clarifications. The author can pinpoint exactly where the changes are needed. So, this is fully grounded and specific. I'll also give it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the experiments should be run and clarifications provided. It doesn't just state facts; it suggests improvements. The justification is somewhat there\u2014running experiments is a logical step\u2014but it's not very detailed. For example, it doesn't cite any external references or provide examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about what needs to be done and why. It provides specific instructions without being too vague. While it could be more detailed, it's still helpful. I think a 4 is appropriate here because it's mostly helpful but could be improved with more specifics.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point mentions that the task setup isn't described clearly but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's vague about the inputs (like EHR notes) and the time frame. Since the action isn't explicitly stated, it's implicit. The reviewer doesn't provide concrete steps on how to improve the setup, so it's not actionable. This falls under borderline actionable because the action is implied but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's addressing. It talks about the task setup but doesn't specify which notes or how far back they go. Without a clear reference, the grounding is weak. However, it does mention the EHR notes and the time frame, which provides some specificity. So, it's weakly grounded and somewhat specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review point doesn't contain a claim. It's more of a question or suggestion without supporting evidence or references. Since there's no claim, it's classified as \"X\" for no claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment raises a valid concern about clarity but doesn't provide specific suggestions or a clear path forward. It's somewhat helpful because it points out an issue, but without actionable steps, it's not fully helpful.\n\nSo, summarizing each aspect:\n- Actionability: Borderline, so label 3.\n- Grounding: Weakly grounded and specific, so label 3.\n- Verifiability: No claim, so X.\n- Helpfulness: Somewhat helpful, so label 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests mentioning a specific paper by Ulyanov et al. and comparing the current method with that class of methods. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. The comment also provides a clear direction on how to implement it by placing the current method in context and comparing. So, it's both explicit and concrete. That should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific paper and suggests a comparison, which means it's fully grounded. It's not just a vague suggestion but clearly points to a part of the literature. So, this also gets a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment includes a claim that Ulyanov et al.'s method is relevant and suggests a comparison. It provides some justification by mentioning recent papers and the utility of untrained NNs. However, it doesn't cite the specific paper or provide detailed references. It's somewhat justified but not fully robust. So, a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out relevant work and suggesting a comparison. It helps the authors by highlighting existing methods and guiding them on how to integrate their work. This is very helpful and constructive. So, a 5 here makes sense.\n\nI think each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review point guides the authors and how clearly it supports the paper.

It's explicit about pointing out a limitation and suggesting an improvement. However, it doesn't specify how to implement this change or what exactly needs to be done. So, it's clear that an action is needed, but the details are vague. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about toy data and real data but doesn't explicitly mention which parts of the paper or sections to focus on. It's a bit vague, so the grounding isn't very strong. It's clear that the issue is with the experiments, but without pointing to specific sections or figures, it's not fully grounded. So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests looking at real data where barycenters can be used. It doesn't provide any references or justification for why real data is better or how the method would perform. It's a suggestion without solid backing, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a clear limitation and provides a constructive suggestion.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the first two sections are hard to read and that the author didn't explain the methods clearly. It then provides specific examples and questions. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the author what to do\u2014improve the explanations. However, the action isn't very concrete. It doesn't tell the author exactly how to improve or what specific changes to make. So, it's not fully actionable. I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific sections and examples, like line 43 and 96, and asks detailed questions about those parts. This shows that the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the issues without making general comments. So, this has full grounding because it clearly identifies the problematic parts of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims about the paper being hard to read and the lack of clear explanations. However, there's no supporting evidence or references provided. The reviewer is pointing out issues but isn't explaining why they're problematic or suggesting solutions. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or examples backing up the claims.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify areas for improvement and provides specific questions, which is helpful.

Both are clear instructions, so they are explicit. However, they don't provide specific steps on how to make the captions more descriptive or explain the scramble network. They are vague on the methods, so they are only somewhat actionable. I think this should be a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"figures, which is usually on a different page\" but doesn't specify which figure or page. It's not clear, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't provide specific details, so it's not fully grounded.

The review also cites three papers. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does suggest that authors should define abbreviations and explain notation, which is explicit. However, the suggestion to cite relevant literature isn't very specific on how to apply this. It's a good start but could be more detailed. So, it's probably a 4 because it's mostly actionable but could be more specific.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review talks about undefined abbreviations and unclear notation but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper it's addressing. It mentions citing other works but doesn't tie those citations directly to the issues raised. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. It's a 3 since it's weakly grounded but somewhat specific about citing other papers.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer suggests defining abbreviations and explaining notation but doesn't provide any justification or references. The citations are mentioned, but without supporting evidence, it's unclear why these references are relevant. So, it's not fully verifiable. It's a 3 because it has some justification but lacks key elements like examples or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review does point out issues and suggest improvements, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are somewhat vague\u2014citing other papers without explaining how they apply. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. So, a 4 seems appropriate as it's mostly helpful but could be improved.\n\nOverall, each aspect has its strengths and areas for improvement, but they're all in the higher ranges.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"1) the evaluation is weak; the baselines used in the paper are not even designed for fair classification.\" It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a problem with the evaluation methods. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out an issue but doesn't specify how to fix it. They mention that the baselines aren't designed for fair classification, which is a problem, but they don't tell the authors how to adjust their approach. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of a statement of a problem without a clear solution. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is in addressing a part of the paper. The review here doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It just talks about the evaluation being weak and the baselines not being designed for fair classification. Since it doesn't point to a specific section or issue, the grounding is weak. It doesn't help the authors know exactly where the problem is or what to fix. So, grounding_specificity would also be 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review makes a claim that the evaluation is weak and the baselines aren't designed for fair classification. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is stating their opinion, but there's no supporting evidence or references. They're just pointing out issues without backing them up. So, there's no justification or evidence provided to support their claims. Therefore, it's not verifiable. It's more of an opinion without any backing, so verifiability would be 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a problem but doesn't provide any actionable steps or specific suggestions. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve their work. Without clear guidance on what's wrong and how to fix it, the review isn't helpful. So, helpfulness would also be 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so each gets a 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions specific algorithms and their methods but doesn't provide clear steps on how to improve the draft. It's more of an observation than a direct action. So, it's not fully actionable. I think it's a 4 because it's somewhat explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific works and mentions their methods, which grounds it in the paper. It also points out issues with the claims made. So, it's fully grounded with specific issues. That should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides some reasoning about the algorithms but lacks specific references or examples. It's somewhat verifiable but not fully. So, a 3 seems appropriate.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review does point out specific issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't cover all areas. So, it's mostly helpful, which is a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding details to the Related Work section, specifically mentioning several methods and their limitations. It also provides references, which makes the action explicit. The instructions say that an explicit action is one where the authors can directly identify the modifications needed. Here, the reviewer is clearly pointing out what needs to be added, so that's explicit. Additionally, the references are concrete, so it's not just vague advice. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific methods like sparse-attention mechanisms and segmentation-based approaches, along with their references. This means the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the parts of the paper that need improvement. They're not just talking about the Related Work section in general but specifically about certain methods. So, this is fully grounded because the section and specific elements are clearly identified. That gives a 5 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides references to specific works, which are external sources. These references support the claims made about the methods and their limitations. While it's good to have references, it could be more detailed, like explaining how these methods apply or why they are relevant. However, the presence of references makes the claim verifiable, so it's mostly verifiable, which is a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is quite comprehensive, suggesting specific areas to improve and providing references. It's clear and actionable, which means the authors can directly implement the changes. The detailed suggestions make it very helpful, so a 5 seems appropriate.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the criteria provided, ensuring that each score reflects how well the review point meets the specific criteria for that aspect.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the proposed solution is an incremental step considering Guzman's work. It also adds minor suggestions. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the reviewer does give a direction by mentioning Guzman's work, which is explicit. However, the suggestions are quite vague\u2014just saying \"minor suggestions\" doesn't provide much detail on what exactly needs to be changed. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to do next. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear, but the details are lacking. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about considering Guzman's work but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be addressed. It's a bit vague. Grounding is about how specific the reference is. Since the reviewer doesn't point out a specific section or issue, it's not fully grounded. It's more of a general comment without pinpointing the problem. So, this should be a \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it's not clearly pointing out the issue but also isn't very vague. I'll rate it a 3 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions Guzman's work but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why Guzman's approach is relevant or better. It just states that the solution is incremental. There's no justification or references, so it's not verifiable. It's more of a claim without support. Therefore, this should be \"Unverifiable\" because there's no backing to validate the claim. So, I'll assign a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some suggestions but they're quite vague. It doesn't specify what needs to be changed or how to implement the suggestions. The authors would still need to figure out the exact steps, which isn't very helpful. It's better than nothing but not very constructive. So, this is \"Somewhat Helpful\" because there's some information, but it's not enough to be fully helpful. I'll give it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the content of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It provides clear actions like highlighting results in tables and suggesting a different plot type. The concreteness is high as it tells the authors exactly what to do.  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**: 5  \n   - The comment mentions specific parts of the paper (Figure 2 and 3) and clearly states what needs to be addressed (labeling the y-axis and suggesting a plot type). The specificity is high as it directly relates to the figures mentioned.  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label**: 3  \n   - The suggestion to use a scatter plot is a claim, but it lacks specific justification. While it provides a clear recommendation, there's no reference to why a scatter plot would be better or any external support. The reasoning is somewhat vague.  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**: 4  \n   - The review offers actionable suggestions and identifies areas for improvement. However, it could be more detailed, such as explaining why the current visualization is lacking or providing more examples of when a scatter plot is appropriate.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Although using advantage instead of q value is more common in practice, I'm wondering if there is other technical consideration for conducting the analysis with advantage instead of q value.\" The reviewer is pointing out a common practice and asking a question about another consideration. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next, like suggesting a change or providing a reference. It's more of a question, so I think it's not very actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"advantage instead of q value\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or analysis this refers to. It's unclear, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the issue or where it's located in the paper. So I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is asking a question without providing evidence or justification. They're not claiming anything; they're just expressing uncertainty. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question and providing some context, which gives the authors something to think about. It's not completely useless, so it's somewhat helpful. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a 3 except verifiability, which is 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says there are some writing errors, like \"informative informative\" on page 5 and \"performance\" on page 1. It mentions these issues but doesn't specify what needs to be fixed. So, the reviewer is pointing out problems but isn't giving clear instructions on how to correct them. That means the action isn't explicit. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions specific pages and mentions \"performance\" but doesn't explain why these are problematic or how they affect the paper. It's vague about what needs to be addressed. So, the grounding isn't strong because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific, which would be a 2 on the grounding_specificity scale.\n\nFor verifiability, the review claims there are writing errors but doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states the issues without supporting evidence. So, the claim isn't well-verified. It's more of a subjective observation without backing, making it unverifiable. Hence, verifiability gets a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out some issues but doesn't provide concrete suggestions or explanations. It's vague and lacks depth, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very helpful overall. Therefore, helpfulness is a 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability: 1, grounding_specificity: 2, verifiability: 1, helpfulness: 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The hGRU architecture seems pretty ad-hoc and not very well motivated.\" The key here is whether this comment provides a clear action for the authors. It mentions that the architecture is ad-hoc and not well motivated, which is a negative point, but it doesn't suggest any specific changes or improvements. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an observation without a clear direction for the authors to act. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it implies an action (improving the motivation) but doesn't specify how. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper's parts. The review doesn't mention any specific section, table, figure, or unique part of the paper. It's a general critique about the architecture being ad-hoc. Since it doesn't pinpoint where exactly the issue is, it's not grounded. It's more of a vague comment, so grounding_specificity would also be 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a judgment that the hGRU is ad-hoc. There's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's just an opinion without backing. So, it's unverifiable because there's no justification or examples given. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out a potential weakness in the architecture. It's clear and provides some insight, but it doesn't suggest specific improvements or how to address the ad-hoc nature. It's helpful in identifying an issue but lacks the depth needed for comprehensive feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this as 2 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using s_n instead of s_t and asks for asymptotic performance and average return results with more environment steps. It also links to a GitHub repository. The action is clear: replace s_t with s_n and ask for specific data. The instructions are explicit, so this should be actionable. The details are concrete, so it's not vague. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while it's clear, it could be more detailed, but it's still good.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions replacing s_t with s_n, which is specific. It also references a GitHub link, which is a specific resource. The comment is clear about what needs to be addressed, so it's fully grounded. It also specifies what kind of results are needed, so it's specific. That gives it a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** score.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion and referencing a specific GitHub repository. The suggestion is clear, and the reference is specific. However, it doesn't provide any justification or reasoning for why s_n should be used instead of s_t. Without supporting evidence, it's hard to verify the claim. So, it's **X: No Claim** because it's a suggestion without backing.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for specific changes and additional data, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague about why s_n is better or what exactly to expect from the results. It could be more detailed, but overall, it's somewhat helpful. So, a **3: Somewhat Helpful** score makes sense.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. The review is clear and specific but lacks some justification and more detailed guidance.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions \"I would tone down this statement\" and suggests improvements like compressing the method section and checking for grammatical errors. These are explicit actions, so the reviewer is directly telling the authors what to do. However, the suggestions are quite vague. For example, \"tone down\" is a general instruction without specifics on how to do that. Similarly, the method section could be wordy, but there's no guidance on how to compress it or what to include. So, while the actions are explicit, the details are lacking, making it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this falls under a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer points out specific issues like the neural network not memorizing exact points and suggests compressing the method section. They also mention grammatical errors. The mention of TopoNet [24] and the method section being wordy are clear references, so the reviewer is grounded. Additionally, they specify what needs improvement in those areas, which adds specificity. Therefore, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer's claims are that the neural network doesn't memorize exact points and that the method section is wordy. They back up the first point with a reference [24], which is good. However, the second point about the method section being wordy is more of a general observation without specific examples or references. So, while there's some justification, it's not fully robust. This would rate a 3 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides specific suggestions and references, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are quite broad and don't offer detailed guidance. For instance, \"tone down\" isn't helpful without knowing how. The mention of grammatical errors is somewhat useful but could be more actionable, like suggesting specific corrections. Overall, while the feedback is meaningful, it's not the most detailed or specific, so it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the explicitness, specificity, justification, and detail provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions comparing Megatron to COCO-LM and says the comparison is overrated. It also lists other models like RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and DeBERTa, pointing out that COCO-LM is parameter-efficient. The reviewer then asks if this conclusion applies to the other works. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the reviewer is giving clear instructions on what to do. The reviewer suggests looking at other models but doesn't specify how or what exactly to do. It's a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to apply this feedback. Maybe they should be told to compare COCO-LM with those other models or explain why the parameter efficiency is applicable. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear there's a need to address the comparison, but the specifics are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about comparing models and mentions specific works. They also ask a question about the BPE vocabulary change. The mention of specific models and the question about the BPE are both clear and specific. The reviewer isn't just making a general comment but is pointing out particular areas. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the parts of the paper and clearly indicating what needs to be addressed.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The reviewer makes a claim that the comparison with Megatron is overrated and that COCO-LM's parameter efficiency is applicable to other models. They back up the latter part by mentioning other models. However, the justification for why the comparison is overrated isn't very detailed. It's a bit vague. So, the claim is supported but lacks depth. I think this falls under **4: Mostly Verifiable** because there's some support, but it's not robust enough.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer provides a comparison and suggests looking at other models, which is helpful. They also ask a question about the BPE change, which encourages the authors to think more deeply. However, the suggestions are somewhat generic and could be expanded. They don't provide detailed guidance on how to conduct the comparison or what specific aspects to focus on. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful** because it does offer meaningful feedback but could be more comprehensive.\n\nOverall, each aspect has its strengths and areas for improvement, but the review still provides valuable guidance for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the analysis from line 128 to 149 isn't convincing enough and points out that GS-P-50 has smaller class selectivity scores. It then explains that this means GS-P-50 shares more features while ResNet-50 learns more class-specific features. The authors hypothesize that additional context could reduce dependency. \n\nHmm, so the review is pointing out an observation and explaining it, but it doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. It suggests that the hypothesis could be explored, but it doesn't provide clear steps or how to implement that. So, it's not giving a direct action, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does suggest an improvement but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific parts of the paper, like Figure 3 and the GS-P-50 model, and mentions class selectivity scores. It also cites external references. The grounding is clear because it accurately points to the figure and the models being discussed. The specificity comes from explaining what the scores mean and how they relate to the hypothesis. So, this seems fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the analysis isn't convincing enough and provides some reasoning about class selectivity and the hypothesis. It references external papers, which adds credibility. However, the reasoning is a bit vague, like explaining that smaller scores mean more shared features but not exactly why that's a problem or how it affects the model. There's some justification but not enough depth. So, it's \"Somewhat Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out an area for improvement and provides some reasoning and references. It's clear and gives a reason why the observation matters. However, it doesn't offer very detailed suggestions on how to proceed or what experiments to run. It's helpful but could be more detailed. So, I'd rate it as \"Mostly Helpful.\"\n\nOverall, each aspect has its strengths and areas for improvement, but none are perfect. The review is clear and informative but could provide more concrete guidance for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Some observations and subsequent design decisions might be hardware and software dependent.\" It mentions that design decisions are dependent on hardware and software, but it doesn't specify what needs to be changed or how to address this. So, it's not giving explicit actions or concrete steps. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to design decisions being hardware and software dependent but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper or specific section this refers to.

It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a potential dependency but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements.

However, it doesn't specify how to improve the AMP algorithm or suggest any modifications. So, while it points out an issue, it doesn't give clear steps for the authors to take. This makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\n**Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the AMP algorithm's usefulness for non-Gaussian problems, which is a specific part of the paper. It also mentions the practical impact, which is a clear area needing attention. So, it's grounded because it accurately points to the relevant section and issue.\n\n**Verifiability**: The claim is that the AMP algorithm's practical impact is limited for non-Gaussian problems. The review doesn't provide evidence or references to support this claim. It's a valid concern but lacks justification, making it somewhat verifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness**: The review raises a relevant point about the AMP algorithm's limitations. It provides a clear area for improvement but doesn't offer specific suggestions or references. This makes it somewhat helpful as it guides the authors to focus on a specific issue, though it could be more detailed.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated as 3 because they all provide some value but lack the full extent required for higher scores.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors perform ablation experiments comparing their method with TubeR. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. But the instructions say to provide concrete details. The review mentions the number of learnable parameters and GFLOPs, which are specific metrics. So, it's explicit and gives clear instructions. That should be a higher score, maybe 4 or 5. But the given label is 3. Hmm, maybe because it's somewhat vague on how to implement the experiments? Or perhaps the metrics are standard, so it's not as novel. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to comparing with TubeR, which is a specific method. It mentions metrics like learnable parameters and GFLOPs, which are specific parts of the paper. So, the grounding is strong because it's clear which part is being addressed. The specificity is also good because it details exactly what needs to be compared. The given label is 3, which seems correct because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the authors should perform these experiments. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why these experiments are necessary. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. The given label is 1, which matches because there's no support for the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review suggests a specific task for the authors, which is helpful. However, it doesn't explain why these experiments are important or how they relate to the paper's strengths or weaknesses. It's somewhat vague, so while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed or insightful feedback. The given label of 3 fits because it's somewhat helpful but could be improved with more context.\n\nOverall, the labels seem appropriate based on the review point's content and the aspects evaluated.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions \"how about other bit operations?\" and \"how did you deal with DVS input?\" These are specific actions the authors can take. However, the last sentence is a bit vague: \"If you can analyze the energy consumption as reference[15] did, this paper would be more solid.\" It suggests an improvement but doesn't tell the authors exactly how to do it. So, it's explicit but not fully concrete. I think this should be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer refers to Figure 5a and mentions another paper [15]. They don't specify which part of the paper or figure they're talking about beyond just mentioning it by number. So, they're not pointing out a specific section or element. This is weak grounding because they can't confidently identify which part is problematic. But they do mention what needs to be addressed, which is some analysis. So, I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim by suggesting analyzing energy consumption like [15] did. They provide a reference, which is good, but they don't explain why this would make the paper more solid or how it applies. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth. So, a 3 here makes sense.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer does point out areas for improvement and suggests a specific analysis, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is a bit vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance. It could be more helpful if it included more specifics on how to conduct that analysis or what metrics to use. So, a 3 seems appropriate here as well.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The review is asking the authors to define the dashed lines in the figures. It's giving a clear action: define something. But is it explicit? Yes, it tells them exactly what to do. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? Well, it says \"define,\" which is pretty straightforward. It doesn't leave much room for interpretation. So I think this is actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's clear but could be more specific about how to define them, like explaining what defines a dashed line in this context.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment is asking about specific figures, 2A-B and 4B. It mentions the figures by name, so that's pretty grounded. It's not just saying \"figure 2\" but specifically \"fig. 2A-B and 4B.\" So the grounding is strong. Specificity-wise, it's asking about the dashed lines, which is specific to the figure. So I'd say this is grounded and specific, maybe a 4 or 5. But since it's just asking to define them, maybe it's not super specific about what exactly needs to be done. So perhaps a 4.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a request, not a claim. It's asking the authors to do something, so there's no claim being made. Therefore, it doesn't require verifiability because there's no assertion to support. So the verifiability label should be X.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment is asking the authors to define something in their figures. It's a straightforward request but doesn't provide any specific guidance on how to define the dashed lines. It's vague in terms of action. So while it's helpful in that it points out an area for improvement, it doesn't give much substance. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Maybe a 2 or 3. Since it's just a request without specifics, I'd lean towards 2.\n\nWait, but the actionability was 3 because it's clear but could be more specific. The grounding was 4 because it's specific about the figures but not about the content within them. Verifiability is X because no claim. Helpfulness is 2 because it's helpful but vague.\n\nSo putting it all together, I think the scores would be actionability 3, grounding 4, verifiability X, and helpfulness 2. But I'm a bit unsure about the helpfulness. Maybe it's a 3 because it does point out an improvement area, even if it's vague.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the description in Section 4.2 doesn't match the equation and points out missing terms like r^q and explains the sigma symbol. It also suggests clarifying the equation's terms. The comment is explicit about the issues and provides clear directions, so it's actionable. It doesn't just point out a problem but also gives guidance on what to do, which makes it quite actionable. So I'd rate this as 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Section 4.2 and specifically points out the mismatch between the description and the equation. It also mentions the absence of r^q and the unclear meaning of sigma. This shows that the reviewer can pinpoint exactly where the issue is, which is a strong form of grounding. Additionally, it clearly explains what needs to be addressed, so this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer provides specific examples and explanations. They mention the missing term r^q and clarify that sigma likely refers to sigmoid activation. They also note that multiplying two sigmoid activations could cause numerical instability. These are concrete points supported by logical reasoning and common knowledge, so this is fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is detailed, pointing out specific issues and providing clear suggestions. It helps the authors understand exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. While it could be expanded, it's already quite helpful. So I'll rate this as 5.\n\nOverall, the review point is comprehensive and provides clear, actionable feedback with solid justification, making it highly helpful across all aspects.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

It just says \"this by itself is grounds for rejection.\" I think the comment is pointing out a problem but doesn't tell the authors what to do next. They know the whitespace issue is bad, but there's no clear fix suggested. So, it's not actionable because it's vague and doesn't provide specific steps. I'd give it a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions whitespace but doesn't specify which part\u2014equations or captions. It's too vague about where the problem is. So, the grounding isn't strong because it doesn't clearly identify the issue.

So this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claims\u2014it's just asking for additional information and clarifications. There's no justification or references needed, so it's not verifiable. I think it should be labeled as \"X\" since there's no claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and directly points out specific areas for improvement. It guides the authors on what to add and where, which is very helpful. It's not vague or incomplete, so it's highly helpful.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects. The review is explicit, specific, doesn't claim anything, and is very helpful to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the winner-take-all property is used in previous works and questions how the paper contributes with simplified settings. It doesn't specify what changes the authors should make. So, the action isn't explicit. It's more of a question than a suggestion, which makes it borderline actionable because it could be inferred, but it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific sections, like Section 5, which is good. However, it doesn't clearly state what needs to be addressed in that section. It's somewhat grounded because it mentions a part of the paper but doesn't specify the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review cites previous works but doesn't provide detailed justification or references. It's somewhat verifiable because there's some support, but it's not robust or specific enough.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out gaps in the paper and references previous work, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete suggestions, so it's somewhat helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated as 3 because they're all somewhat in each category, not fully meeting the higher criteria but still providing some value.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It's explicit about the action, which is good. But it's vague on the specifics, like what exactly should be explained and how. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out the details themselves. That makes it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions morphologic segmentation across different domains but doesn't specify which parts of the paper or sections it refers to. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where to focus their improvements. This means it's not fully grounded, so I'd give it a 3 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any evidence or justification for why morphologic segmentation should or shouldn't be invariant across domains. It's just a statement without supporting references or logical reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary details, making it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest areas for improvement, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or evidence, so it's not the most helpful.

It mentions that the authors only mention poor performance but don't provide analysis. So, the comment is pointing out an action the authors should take, which is to analyze the reasons behind the poor performance. That seems explicit. But is it concrete? The review doesn't tell the authors exactly how to analyze it\u2014like whether to look at model architecture, training data, or something else. So, it's explicit about the action but vague on the details. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions that the authors don't provide analysis of the underlying reasons. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs analysis. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact section or issue. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the analysis is insufficient. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just stating an opinion without backing it up. So, it's not verifiable. That would be **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a weakness and suggests the authors improve their analysis. It's clear and gives a direction for improvement. Even though it's not fully detailed, it's helpful enough to guide the authors. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that's a solid breakdown.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that performance and sample efficiency are sensitive to \u03bb parameters and provides some citations. It also asks the authors to explain how \u03bb is computed. The comment is explicit about the need to understand \u03bb's computation, which is a direct action. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to compute \u03bb or provide a method, so it's a bit vague. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \u03bb parameters and cites external works. It doesn't explicitly mention specific sections or parts of the paper, so the grounding is weak. However, it does point to relevant literature, which helps authors understand the context. Since it's pointing out a specific issue without needing to guess, I'd say it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests looking into the cited papers for understanding \u03bb's computation. This provides some justification and references, making it somewhat verifiable. It's not fully supported with logical reasoning or examples, so it's a \"Somewhat Verifiable\" score.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the need to understand \u03bb's computation and provides relevant literature. It gives the authors a direction to improve their work, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer detailed steps or examples, so it's not the most helpful. I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Now, I'll summarize each with the scores.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the novelty is limited and mentions interpreting deep neural networks using a linear model isn't new. It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. They don't get a clear action or improvement plan. So, this is unactionable because there's no direct guidance on how to proceed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the novelty being limited but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs improvement. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. That means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points out that interpreting deep neural networks with a linear model isn't new. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a general statement without justification, so it's not verifiable. There's no logical reasoning or external sources backing up the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does identify a problem\u2014the lack of novelty in the approach\u2014but it's vague and doesn't offer specific suggestions. The authors still don't know what changes to make. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully constructive. It falls under the \"helpful\" category because it does point out an issue, just not in a detailed way.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 1 except helpfulness, which is a 2 because it's not entirely helpful but provides some insight.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the experiments should be more comprehensive and general. It mentions that the model size is limited and the baselines are restrictive for both tasks. Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. \n\nLooking at the definitions, an explicit action would be something like recommending a specific change, while an implicit one is more vague. Here, the reviewer is suggesting improvements but doesn't specify exactly what to do. They mention making the experiments more comprehensive but don't give concrete steps. So, it's not fully explicit. It's also not vague because they do point out specific issues with model size and baselines. \n\nWait, but the problem is that while they identify the issue, they don't tell the authors exactly what to do. They just say \"more comprehensive\" which is a bit vague. So, it's somewhere between explicit and implicit. According to the scale, 3 is \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it explicitly states the action but is vague on how to implement it. So, I think the actionability label should be 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review mentions both tasks, language modeling and image classification, and points out the model size and baselines. It seems like they are accurately pinpointing specific sections or aspects of the paper. They don't just say \"the model is bad,\" but rather specify where the issues lie. So, they have full grounding because they clearly identify the sections being addressed. \n\nLooking at the scale, 5 is fully grounded and specific. Since they accurately mention the parts, it should be 5. But wait, the initial thought was 3 for actionability, but for grounding, it's definitely 5 because they clearly reference specific sections.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: This aspect is about whether the claims are supported by evidence. The review doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up the suggestions. They just state that the experiments should be more comprehensive. There's no justification or examples given. So, this falls under \"Unverifiable\" because there's no supporting evidence. Therefore, the verifiability label is 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers suggestions but doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to improve the experiments. They mention making them more comprehensive but don't specify what steps to take. This is somewhat helpful because they do point out areas for improvement, but it's not very detailed. So, it's between 3 and 4. Since it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive, I'll go with 3.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought grounding was 5, which makes sense because they clearly reference specific parts. Actionability was 3 because it's vague on implementation. Verifiability was 1 because no evidence is provided. Helpfulness was 3 because it's somewhat helpful but not fully detailed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the labels should be:\n- actionability: 3\n- grounding_specificity: 5\n- verifiability: 1\n- helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding an ablation study to explain the choice of using few-shot examples for CoT. It doesn't specify exactly how to implement this, like whether they should compare with zero-shot or few-shot, or what metrics to use. So, the action is explicit\u2014adding an ablation study\u2014but the details are vague. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but the specifics are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions adding an ablation study but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention what's needed, but not where exactly.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or references. It's just recommending adding an ablation study without backing it up. So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's a claim (to add an ablation study) but no justification or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting an ablation study but doesn't provide any rationale or evidence for why this is beneficial. It's helpful in that it points out a needed improvement, but it lacks depth. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it gives a suggestion but doesn't elaborate on its benefits or provide context.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review says, \"Evidently, replacing any of the procedure steps of XAIFOILER with a random mechanism dropped its performance\" and then adds, \"I'm unsure that 'better than random' is a strong demonstration of capability.\" \n\nFirst, I check if the review gives an explicit action. It mentions replacing steps with a random mechanism and the effect on performance, which is explicit. However, the second part is a question about the strength of the demonstration, which is more of an implicit action. So, it's not fully explicit. Since it's not entirely clear on how to apply the action, it's probably **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to XAIFOILER, which I assume is a specific algorithm or model. It mentions replacing procedure steps, which is specific. However, the second part is a critique about the strength of the demonstration, which is more general and not specifically pointing out a part of the paper. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does identify the area but doesn't clearly specify what's wrong.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the first part is a claim that replacing steps with random affects performance. It's supported by the first statement but lacks specific examples or references. The second part is a critique without justification. So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but not enough.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review provides some feedback on the performance impact but the critique about the strength of the demonstration is vague. It doesn't offer clear guidance on how to improve. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does touch on weaknesses but lacks depth.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says, \"the results in section 4 apply only to shallow fully-connected ReLU networks.\" I'm trying to see if this is actionable. It mentions a specific section and a type of network, so that's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It says the results apply only to this specific case, implying that maybe the authors should consider if their work is limited. However, it doesn't suggest an improvement or a fix. So, it's explicit but doesn't give a clear action. Maybe it's borderline because it's explicit but not concrete on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to section 4 and a specific type of network. It's pretty specific about the section but doesn't mention anything else. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing out a unique aspect or a specific part beyond what's already obvious. It's explicit about the section but not about why it's limited or what the implications are.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the results apply only to shallow networks. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states that. So, there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. It's a claim without any backing, so it's not helpful in terms of verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out a limitation but doesn't suggest how to address it. It's clear that the results are limited, but without any guidance on what to do next, it's not very helpful. It's better than nothing but doesn't fully assist the authors in improving their work.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect is either 1 or 2. Actionability is borderline, so 1. Grounding is weak, so 1. Verifiability is unverifiable, so 1. Helpfulness is barely helpful, so 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the experiments aren't sufficient and suggests more empirical or toy experiments. It also mentions citing Kaplan et al. 2020. The action here is clear: do more experiments and cite a reference. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. The details are concrete\u2014like specifying the types of experiments and the citation. So this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"more empirical experiments\" and \"toy experiments\" for a simplified model. It's specific about the type of experiments and even mentions toy ones. It also references a specific paper, which adds grounding. The authors can pinpoint exactly where to focus their experiments. So this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests citing Kaplan et al. 2020 but doesn't provide a detailed explanation of why that citation is relevant or how it supports the claim. It's a reference but lacks justification. So it's somewhat verifiable because there's some support, but it's not robust or clear. That would be a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out the need for more experiments and provides a specific citation. It's clear and actionable, which helps the authors improve their work. While it's not the most detailed, it's still very helpful. So I'd rate this a 5 because it's thorough and constructive, even if there's a slight gap in justification.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at a high level, especially actionability and grounding. Verifiability is a bit lower but still good, and helpfulness is top-notch.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the Frobenius norm definition in line 77 doesn't need the absolute value because tensor entries are real. It suggests removing the absolute value. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. But the comment doesn't explain why the absolute value isn't needed, just states the action. So it's explicit but lacks detail on how to apply it. I think that makes it **Somewhat Actionable** which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions line 77 and specifically the Frobenius norm. It's pointing out a particular part of the paper, so it's grounded. It also clearly states what's wrong, which is specific. So this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**, a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a judgment that the absolute value isn't needed. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just an opinion without backing, so it's **Unverifiable**, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment suggests a minor change but doesn't explain why or how it affects the norm. It's vague and doesn't provide enough context, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That would be a **Somewhat Helpful**, which is a 3.\n\nSo putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review suggests adding experiments where the image is occluded. It mentions two purposes: simulating data irregularity and inspecting the model's inference capacity. The review is explicit about the actions needed, like running these experiments. It also provides clear instructions on how to implement them, such as randomly blacking out parts of the image and expecting the model to handle missing data. So, this is explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific experiments involving image occlusion, which clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed. It doesn't just mention a general aspect but specifically points out the image manipulation. The grounding is strong because it accurately pinpoints the section. The specificity is also high as it explains exactly what changes are needed. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review presents a claim that adding these experiments would improve the study. It supports this by explaining how these experiments simulate real data issues and help assess the model's capabilities. The reasoning is logical and provides clear justifications without needing external references. It's thoroughly supported, so this is fully verifiable. I'll score it 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review offers clear and specific suggestions for experiments, which directly address potential weaknesses in the current methodology. It provides actionable steps and explains their benefits, making it very helpful for the authors. The suggestions are detailed enough to guide the authors in enhancing their work. Therefore, this is highly helpful, earning a 5.\n\nOverall, each aspect is well addressed with explicit actions, clear grounding, solid verifiability, and significant helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using a second y-axis or another visualization. That's pretty explicit, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer gives two specific actions: using a second y-axis or another visualization. That's clear and direct, so it's definitely concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions figure 6C and suggests a specific solution. They don't reference any external work, but they do clearly point out the issue with the figure. So, they've grounded it by specifying which part of the paper is problematic and what needs to be done. That's fully grounded and specific, so another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer's claim is that the figure implies negative rates, which isn't the case. They suggest using a second y-axis or another visualization. The suggestion is clear and provides a solution, so it's well-supported. There's no need for external references here, but the reasoning is logical and precise. So, this is fully verifiable, which is a 5. Wait, but in the initial assessment, I thought it was 3. Maybe I made a mistake there. Let me double-check. The claim is that the figure is misleading, and the suggestion is a specific fix. The fix is clear and doesn't require external references, so it should be fully verifiable. So, maybe it's a 5, not 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides specific suggestions and explains why the current figure is problematic. This is clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful. That's a 5, not a 4 as I initially thought.\n\nWait, but in the initial output, grounding_specificity was 5, verifiability was 3, and helpfulness was 4. But upon re-evaluation, I think verifiability and helpfulness should both be 5. Maybe I misapplied the scales earlier. Let me make sure.\n\nVerifiability: The claim is supported by logical reasoning (suggesting a second y-axis) without needing external references. So, it's fully verifiable, which is 5.\n\nHelpfulness: The reviewer's points are clear, specific, and directly address the issue, making it highly helpful, so 5.\n\nSo, correcting the initial assessment, the labels should be:\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

The motivation of this work should be further justified. In few-shot learning, we usually consider how to leverage a few instances to learn a generalizable model.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It is not clear if the proposed methodology is specific to bimanual manipulation. Just using robotic manipulation could be more appropriate.\" The author is suggesting that the methodology isn't specific enough and that using robotic manipulation might be better. This is an explicit action because it directly tells the author what to check and what alternative to consider. However, it doesn't provide much detail on how to check if the methodology is specific to bimanual manipulation. So, it's not vague in terms of action, but it lacks specifics on how to implement the change. That makes it **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"the proposed methodology is specific to bimanual manipulation\" but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper this refers to. The author is talking about the methodology but isn't pinpointing exactly where or how it applies. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly linking to a specific section or figure. It's more of a general comment without specific references, so it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the methodology isn't specific to bimanual manipulation. However, there's no supporting evidence or references provided. The author is suggesting an alternative, but without backing, it's hard to verify if this is accurate or helpful. So, it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a potential issue with the methodology and suggests an alternative. While it's helpful in identifying an area for improvement, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or evidence. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful but not fully so. That makes it **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

This is a clear, direct action the authors can take. Additionally, it explains how to apply this action by mentioning the need for a theory and examining the experimental design. This makes the action both explicit and concrete.  \n   - **Score**: 5  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   The review mentions the 1-shot setting specifically, which is a clear and specific part of the paper.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review suggests the reviewer is confused about Figure 3 and asks for clarification on adjusting amplitudes based on the Frequency Stability score and how that affects prediction accuracy. It also asks for an explanation of why these adjustments are effective. Additionally, it points out spacing issues in Equations (9) and (10). \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer is given specific areas to look into and specific questions to answer. The adjustments to amplitudes and the Frequency Stability score are clearly mentioned, so that's explicit. The questions about why the adjustments are effective are also specific. The spacing issue is another concrete point. So, the reviewer knows exactly what to do and what to explain. That seems highly actionable because each part is clear and direct. So, I'd give this a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to Figure 3 and Equations (9) and (10). It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper these are, but Figure 3 is a specific part. The equations are also specific because they're referenced by number. The specificity is about clearly pointing out what needs to be addressed. Since the reviewer is directed to specific sections and equations, it's grounded. The specificity is good because it mentions exact parts. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The comment is making claims by suggesting improvements and asking for explanations. The adjustments to amplitudes and the Frequency Stability score are based on the provided paper, so that's verifiable. The explanation about why these adjustments are effective would require some reasoning, but it's based on the existing literature. The spacing issue is more of a factual observation. So, the claims are supported with some reasoning and references, making it mostly verifiable. I think a 4 here is appropriate.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is asked to clarify Figure 3 and explain certain adjustments and their effectiveness, as well as address spacing in equations. These are all meaningful suggestions that would help improve the paper. The questions are specific and actionable, so the reviewer gains clear insights. While it's not the most detailed, it's still very helpful. So, a 4 seems right here.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the explicitness, concreteness, grounding, verifiability, and the overall helpfulness of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says that \"abbreviations like 'MoCo' should not appear in the section header, since a reader might not know what it means.\" The action here is suggesting that 'MoCo' shouldn't be in the header. It's explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. Now, is it concrete? Well, it tells them exactly where to make the change, which is the section header. So, it's not just a suggestion; it's specific about where the fix is needed. That makes it highly actionable because the authors know exactly where to go and what to do. So, I'd give this a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions 'MoCo' in the section header. Is this part of the paper clearly identified? Yes, it's a specific part of the header. The comment doesn't go beyond that, but it's specific enough for the authors to know where the issue is. So, the grounding is full because it accurately points to the section. As for specificity, the comment explains why 'MoCo' shouldn't be there, which is that a reader might not know its meaning. That's clear and specific about the problem. So, this should also get a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a suggestion, not a claim, so it doesn't require evidence. It's more of a recommendation. Since there's no claim being made, it doesn't fall under verifiability. Therefore, it's not verifiable at all, so I'd give it a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is clear about suggesting where to make a change and why. It's helpful because it points out a specific issue and provides a reason for it. However, it's somewhat generic in that it doesn't offer multiple suggestions or delve deeper into the implications of the change. So, while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The technical contribution is unclear. Most of the analysis are quite standard.\" Hmm, the first part, \"The technical contribution is unclear,\" is a statement of fact, but it doesn't tell the author what to do next. The second part, \"Most of the analysis are quite standard,\" also points out an issue but doesn't suggest an action. So, this doesn't give any explicit or implicit actions for the author to take. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the technical contribution is unclear\" and \"most of the analysis are quite standard.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper is unclear or where the standard analysis is. The author can't pinpoint the exact issue, so there's no strong grounding. It's more of a general statement without pointing to a specific section or element. So, grounding_specificity would also be 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review states that the technical contribution is unclear and that most analyses are standard. It doesn't provide any justification or references for these claims. There's no logical reasoning or external sources cited, so it's not verifiable. This means verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out issues with the technical contribution and mentions standard analyses, which gives the author some insight. However, it's vague and doesn't provide specific suggestions or detailed feedback. It's helpful but not comprehensive. So, helpfulness would be 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is scored as follows: actionability 1, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

It mentions the lack of a sparsity constraint but does not specify what changes should be made.

It implies a problem but does not specify the exact part of the paper or method that requires improvement. Hence, it is weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nRegarding verifiability, the claim is that the model will not be incentivized to use fewer factors, leading to more factors and increased computation. However, the justification is vague and lacks specific references or logical reasoning to support why this leads to increased computation.

It feels a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to know exactly what to do. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it explicitly states an action but doesn't give clear details on how to implement it. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review does mention specific parts of the paper, like the LN model needing regularization and the GLM not using cropping but L1 regularization. It's pretty clear and specific about what's being addressed. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific\" because it accurately points out the sections and what's wrong with them. That's a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides some justification by suggesting the authors try to reproduce previous models. However, it's not very detailed. It doesn't cite any external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. I think this is a \"Somewhat Verifiable\" score, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out some issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide much concrete guidance. It's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.

It's explicit about the action\u2014introducing epsilon\u2014and it's concrete because it tells the authors exactly where to apply it. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions equation (11) but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague because it doesn't clearly identify the section or equation. So, it's not fully grounded but still somewhat specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting a change for clarity but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just a recommendation without backing, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the improvement needed but doesn't explain why introducing epsilon would help or provide any context. It's somewhat helpful because it points out an area for improvement, but it lacks depth.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Actionability: 5 (explicit and concrete)\n- Grounding_specificity: 3 (specific but not fully grounded)\n- Verifiability: 1 (unverifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 4 (somewhat helpful with clear suggestion)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says, \"In Theorem A.3 proof, how the input x has two indices? The input is a vector, not a matrix. Moreover, shouldn\u2019t \u2211 k ( W k ( 2 ) ) 2 = 1 / d , not d ?\" \n\nFirst, is this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is pointing out that the input x is a vector, not a matrix, which is an explicit statement. They also mention that the sum should be 1/d instead of d, which is another explicit point. So the reviewer is giving clear instructions on what's wrong and what should be corrected. That seems explicit. \n\nNow, is the action concrete? The reviewer isn't just pointing out an issue; they're also suggesting the correct value. So the authors know exactly what to do. There's no vagueness here. Therefore, this should be **actionable**. But is it highly actionable or just somewhat? Since the reviewer is very specific about both the nature of the input and the correction needed, it's quite concrete. So I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while it's actionable, it could be more detailed, but it's definitely clear.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions \"The input is a vector, not a matrix\" and \"shouldn\u2019t \u2211 k ( W k ( 2 ) ) 2 = 1 / d , not d ?\" They're directly referring to the input x having two indices, implying it's a vector. This is explicit about the part of the paper being addressed, so the grounding is strong. They also specify what's wrong with the equation, making it specific. Therefore, this should be **fully grounded and specific**, which is **5**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the input being a vector and the sum being 1/d. They're not citing external references or providing logical reasoning beyond what's in the paper. However, they are clear and logical. Since they're pointing out factual errors, it's somewhat verifiable, but without external references, it's a bit lacking. So I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because the claims are clear but lack supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out specific issues in the proof, suggesting corrections, and asking for clarification. This is clear and actionable, so it should be helpful. However, it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback. It's helpful but could be expanded. So I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and constructive, though not exhaustive.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, the helpfulness was given as 3. Maybe I should reconsider. The feedback is specific and points out clear issues, so it's quite helpful. Perhaps it should be a 4 instead of a 3. But given the other aspects, maybe the helpfulness is still a 3 because it's somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive. Hmm, I'm a bit conflicted here. I think it's better to stick with the initial assessment unless there's a reason to change it. So I'll keep it as 3.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 3\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions missing supervised baselines and suggests adding them. It provides a clear action, which is adding these baselines, and gives some guidance on how to implement them by comparing to a fully supervised pre-trained network. This seems explicit and concrete, so I think it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to experiments on datasets with ~100k images and mentions full annotation availability. It doesn't explicitly name a specific part of the paper but clearly points out where improvements are needed. This shows strong grounding because it's specific enough for the authors to understand where to focus their efforts.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides logical reasoning by suggesting adding baselines and comparing them to a supervised model. It doesn't cite external references, but the reasoning is clear and logical, so it's somewhat verifiable. I'm leaning towards a 4 because it's mostly supported but could benefit from more references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions and compares self-supervised methods to supervised ones, which is very helpful for the authors. It guides them on what to add without being vague. This makes it highly helpful.\n\nSo, my scores are 5 for all aspects except verifiability, which I think is 4 because it's mostly supported without external references.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n} <think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the given review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review point suggests changing a set to a multiset in section 4. It also mentions that the histogram should include multiplicities for accurate representation. The comment is explicit about the change needed and provides a clear direction on what to do. It doesn't leave room for interpretation, so it's actionable. Since it's explicit and concrete, it should be highly actionable.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe comment specifically mentions section 4 and the need for a multiset instead of a set. It refers to the histogram and the necessity of including multiplicities. This is fully grounded because it clearly points to the section and the specific issue. It doesn't just imply but actually names the part of the paper, so grounding_specificity is high.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe comment suggests a mathematical change (using a multiset instead of a set) and explains why it's necessary for accurately representing the graph. While it's clear, it doesn't provide external references or detailed reasoning beyond the obviousness of the change. It's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth, so it's rated as 3.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review point is very specific about the change needed and explains the reasoning clearly. It provides a clear suggestion without being vague. This makes it highly helpful as it guides the authors directly on what to do. Therefore, it should be a 5.\n\nI think each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring that each score reflects the clarity, specificity, verifiability, and overall usefulness of the comment.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says the paper is well-organized and the writing is good. It then lists weaknesses and feedback, asking for specific improvements like a table comparing CoT methods, and questions about assumptions and selection criteria. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out specific areas for improvement, like suggesting a table, but they don't tell the authors exactly how to create that table or what data to include. So it's explicit in pointing out what needs to be done but not explicit on how to do it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on the implementation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions specific areas like a table comparison and questions about assumptions and criteria. They clearly identify the sections or aspects being discussed, which is a strong point. Additionally, they ask about specific details like token and step counts, which adds specificity. So this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because the reviewer accurately points to the parts and explains what needs to be addressed in detail.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The reviewer is making claims about the writing being good and organization, but then provides specific questions and suggestions. These are claims that require justification. They ask why certain assumptions are made and whether criteria are reasonable, which would need evidence or references. However, the justification is present but could be more detailed. So it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because the claims are supported but lack depth in reasoning or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer offers specific questions and suggestions, which is helpful. They aren't vague but are somewhat incomplete, as they don't provide full guidance on creating the table or evaluating the criteria. This makes it **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and actionable but could be expanded for more comprehensive feedback.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the criteria provided, ensuring that each score reflects the clarity, specificity, justification, and overall usefulness of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the authors didn't do significance testing and provides an example where they compared different models. It suggests adding tests but doesn't specify how. So, the action is clear\u2014add tests\u2014but the details are vague. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this should be a 4 because it's explicit about the action but lacks specifics on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific models like ChatGPT, GPT-4, FeedME-2, and PPO by name, which is pretty specific. It also mentions metrics like d-BLEU and humeval scores, which are specific to the models. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the parts of the paper being discussed. I'd give this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests adding significance testing but doesn't provide external references or examples. It's clear that the authors need to do this, but without supporting evidence, it's somewhat verifiable. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it's clear there's a claim but lacks the necessary justification or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is clear about pointing out the missing tests and provides an example, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer detailed guidance on what kind of tests to conduct or how to interpret the results. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. A 4 seems right here because it's clear and actionable but could be more comprehensive.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the explicitness, specificity, justification, and overall usefulness of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"Results should be averaged over multiple runs to determine statistical significance.\" I remember that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do: average the results. But is it concrete? It tells them what to do, but it doesn't specify how to average them. For example, it doesn't mention using the mean, median, or any particular method. So, it's explicit but not concrete. That would make it a 4 on the actionability scale because it's mostly actionable but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It just suggests averaging results. The authors can't pinpoint which section or figure this refers to, so it's not grounded. Since it's not grounded at all, it gets a 1 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting averaging results. But there's no justification or support provided. It's just a statement without any reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment is somewhat helpful because it tells the authors what to do. However, it's vague about how to average the results, which means the authors might not know exactly how to implement it. It's helpful but not as detailed as it could be. So, it's a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"In my opinion, the contribution of this paper appears somewhat limited, and the proposed model seems incremental in its approach.\" The author is expressing an opinion about the paper's contribution and the model's approach. But there's no specific action suggested. The reviewer isn't telling the authors what to do or how to improve. So, this is more of a general statement without any actionable steps. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions the paper's contribution and the model's approach but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is limited or incremental. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issues are, so there's no clear grounding. This means the grounding is weak because it doesn't identify a specific section or issue. So, grounding_specificity would also be 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review contains a claim that the contribution is limited and the model is incremental. However, there's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. The reviewer is just stating their opinion without backing it up with references or logical reasoning. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification for the claim. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review offers some feedback about the paper's contribution and model approach but lacks specific suggestions or details. It's vague and doesn't guide the authors on how to improve their work. Without concrete actions or evidence, it's not very helpful. So, helpfulness is also 1.\n\nOverall, the review point doesn't provide actionable steps, specific grounding, verifiable claims, or substantial help to the authors. It's just a general opinion without any meaningful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper verifies different metrics for different OPE methods and points out differences in Figure 4 and 5. It ends with a request for comments on the differences between evaluation methods. Explicitly, it's asking for a comment, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify exactly what the author should do next, like suggesting specific changes or improvements. So, it's not fully actionable because the action is implicit. That would rate it as 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 4 and 5 by name, which is a clear mention of specific parts of the paper. It also discusses differences in evaluation methods, which are specific aspects of the paper. This strong grounding makes it a 5 on the grounding_specificity scale.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment about the differences in evaluation methods but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's clear and logical, but lacks justification or references, so it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides specific feedback about the figures and the differences in methods. It guides the author to consider these aspects but doesn't go into depth or suggest specific fixes. So, it's somewhat helpful, scoring a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the clarity, specificity, and support provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the regularization term is ad-hoc and lacks theoretical support. It suggests using other statistics like the median instead of the mean. The comment is explicit about the action\u2014suggesting changes to the regularization. It also provides some direction on what could be used instead. So, it's clear and gives the authors a specific action to take. That should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review points out that the regularization lacks theoretical support and suggests using other statistics. It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper it's referring to, but it's clear that it's talking about the regularization section. The specificity is good because it clearly states what needs improvement. So, I'd rate this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests using the median as an alternative. It doesn't provide external references or detailed reasoning, but it's a logical suggestion based on common knowledge about statistics. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a specific issue and suggests improvements. It's clear and provides actionable feedback. It doesn't seem too vague, so it's quite helpful. I'd give this a 4 because while it's helpful, it could be more detailed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores should be actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review points are:\na. Need to report average over multiple runs. Results are very close together and it is hard to favor one method.\nb. Sec. 3.1: Since this is the toy-dataset, a discussion why the decision boundaries look as they do, would be interesting.\nc. Sec. 3.3: What information is in Fig. 9 middle and right?\n\nFor each of these, I need to check if they're explicit or implicit and if they're concrete. \n\nPoint a is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do: report the average. It's concrete because it specifies the average over multiple runs and mentions that the results are close, so the authors know exactly how to improve.\n\nPoint b is a bit more vague. It suggests adding a discussion about decision boundaries but doesn't specify what exactly to discuss. It's implicit because the authors have to infer what to add. It's not very concrete because it doesn't tell them what aspect of the decision boundaries to focus on.\n\nPoint c is explicit because it asks for information in specific figures. It's concrete because it tells them exactly which figures to look at.\n\nSo, combining these, two points are fully actionable (a and c), and one is borderline (b). Since b is only partially actionable, the overall actionability score should be 5 because the majority of the points are actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. This looks at whether the review points clearly identify the specific parts of the paper.\n\nPoint a refers to the experimental section and mentions multiple runs, which is specific enough. It's fully grounded because it mentions the section and what to do.\n\nPoint b refers to Section 3.1 and suggests a discussion about decision boundaries. It's specific because it mentions the section and the topic, but it's a bit vague about what exactly to discuss.\n\nPoint c refers to Figure 9 and asks about specific parts. It's specific because it mentions the figure and the parts.\n\nSo, two points are fully grounded, and one is only partially grounded. Since it's mostly grounded, the score should be 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, we need to check if the claims are supported by evidence.\n\nPoint a is a claim that averaging multiple runs is needed. It's supported by the fact that averaging can show trends, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nPoint b is a suggestion to discuss decision boundaries, which is a claim. It doesn't provide specific references or examples, so it's only somewhat verifiable.\n\nPoint c is a request for information about figures, which is a claim. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nOverall, all points are somewhat verifiable, so the score is 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. This is about how useful the comments are for the authors.\n\nPoint a is very helpful because it's explicit and concrete about reporting averages.\n\nPoint b is somewhat helpful but vague. It gives a suggestion but doesn't specify what to add, so it's less helpful.\n\nPoint c is helpful because it's explicit about looking at figures, but again, it's vague on what information to seek.\n\nOverall, the comments are mostly helpful with some vagueness, so a 4 seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions specific experiments and points out issues, so it's explicit. It tells the authors what to do, like compare to DEN and use the same setup. That's concrete, so it's highly actionable. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review clearly references the continual learning literature and the specific dataset, CIFAR. It points out that other works have done extensive experiments there, which helps the authors pinpoint the issue. It's fully grounded and specific, so another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides specific references and examples. It mentions the continual learning literature and the DEN paper, which are external sources. It also explains what the authors should do to make the comparison fair. That's thorough, so I'll give it a 4 because it's fully verifiable but maybe a bit vague in some parts.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out clear issues and giving actionable suggestions. It helps the authors improve by highlighting specific areas and what to do. It's somewhat detailed but could be expanded a bit more. So, a 4 seems right here.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

It is a factual description of the current implementation and questions the methodology without providing justification or references.  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**: \"3\" (Somewhat Helpful)  \n   - The review provides some clarity on the issue but lacks depth and detail. It raises a valid concern about the network's ability to predict all keypoints, which could be helpful for the authors to consider, but it doesn't offer specific suggestions or solutions.  \n\nOverall, the review is somewhat helpful as it identifies a potential issue, but it doesn't provide actionable steps or detailed justification, making it less helpful than it could be.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says that legends and axis labels should be larger. That's a clear action. But it doesn't specify how much larger or where exactly. It also mentions captions and legend font size but doesn't give details on how to adjust them. So, it's explicit about the action but vague on the specifics. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I think a 3 is appropriate.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about legends, axis labels, captions, and font sizes. It doesn't mention specific sections of the paper, so it's not fully grounded. It's a bit vague about which parts exactly, so I'd rate this as 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the review doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states that the font size should be larger but doesn't explain why or where. There's no logical reasoning or external sources, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest some changes, which is helpful, but it's vague and lacks specific details. It doesn't guide the authors on how to implement these changes, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'll give it a 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

This is a clear action.  \n   - However, the suggestion is vague on how to implement this. It mentions comparing at a particular step but doesn't specify the exact step or method.  \n   - Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable** (3).  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - The review point mentions a specific figure (Figure 2) from an external source (Journey TRAK).  \n   - It clearly identifies the part of the paper (counterfactual experiments) and the specific element (Figure 2) to compare.  \n   - This is **Fully Grounded and Specific** (5).  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   - The claim is that removing high-scoring images according to Journey TRAK has a larger effect.  \n   - The justification references a specific figure from an external source, which is a well-known reference.  \n   - The reasoning is logical and directly supports the claim.  \n   - This is **Fully Verifiable** (5).  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   - The review provides a clear need for a comparison and references a specific figure and external work.  \n   - It suggests a specific change but doesn't elaborate on how to implement it.  \n   - The feedback is somewhat incomplete but still helpful for the authors to understand where improvements are needed.  \n   - This is **Mostly Helpful** (4).  \n\nFinal Output:\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}  \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Actionability Label**:  \n   - The review clearly states what needs to be done (compare with Journey TRAK).  \n   - However, it doesn't specify how to do it (e.g., at which step of the sampling trajectory).  \n   - Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable** (3).  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - References a specific figure (Figure 2) from an external source (Journey TRAK).  \n   - Clearly identifies the part of the paper (counterfactual experiments) and the specific element (Figure 2) to compare.  \n   - This is **Fully Grounded and Specific** (5).  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   - The claim is that removing high-scoring images according to Journey TRAK has a larger effect.  \n   - Supported by reference to Figure 2 from an external source, which is a well-established reference.  \n   - The reasoning is logical and directly supports the claim.  \n   - This is **Fully Verifiable** (5).  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   - Provides a clear need for a comparison and references a specific figure and external work.  \n   - While it suggests a specific change, it doesn't elaborate on implementation details.  \n   - The feedback is somewhat incomplete but still valuable for the authors to understand where improvements are needed.  \n   - This is **Mostly Helpful** (4).  \n\nFinal Output:\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}  \n\n**Final Answer**\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that theoretical discussions need improvements and lists specific areas like sample complexity-type results. It provides some direction but doesn't tell the author exactly what to do. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for improvement but not concrete on how to achieve it. That seems like it's on the higher end of actionable but not fully explicit. I'd say it's 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to theoretical discussions and mentions specific theorems related to mutual information and DP. It's pretty specific about the parts of the paper that need attention. It doesn't just say \"the paper needs improvement\" but points to exact sections. So, this should be fully grounded and specific. That's a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that theoretical discussions need improvements and supports it by stating why\u2014because the theorems follow from algorithm design and mutual information properties. It also suggests looking for sample complexity results. The reasoning is clear, and it references known concepts, so it's well-supported. I'd rate this a 5 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out areas for improvement and provides specific suggestions. It doesn't just say the paper is bad but gives concrete ideas on what to work on. This should be highly helpful. So, a 5 here too.\n\nOverall, the review is thorough and provides clear guidance, making it highly actionable, grounded, verifiable, and helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the author has doubts about the definitions in Table 1 and questions the differences between anchor-based regression and RepPoints regression. It suggests that the author should clarify this problem. The comment is explicit in pointing out the doubt and asking for clarification, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't provide specific steps on how to clarify or what exactly to look for. So, it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete details. I think this falls under a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Table 1 and mentions specific methods like RepPoints and anchor-based regression. It also discusses other works like RetinaNet and ATSS, which are well-known. The mention of these specific references and the literature makes the grounding strong. The author is directed to look at these specific areas, so it's fully grounded. I'll give it a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that there's no obvious difference between the two regression methods. It supports this with the statement that RepPoints regresses distance to feature maps, while the method regressing [w, h] to the center is sufficient. This provides logical reasoning and references to other works, making the claim verifiable. I think this is a 4 because it's mostly verifiable but could be more detailed.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear in pointing out the confusion and suggesting clarification. It provides enough context for the authors to understand the issue and take action. While it's somewhat general, it's helpful enough to guide the authors. I'll rate this a 4 as it's mostly helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 4, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests clarifying whether Fourier modes are real or complex. That's a direct action, so it's explicit. The comment also gives a clear direction on how to implement it by specifying to check the definitions. Since both the action and how to apply it are provided, this should be highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Fourier modes specifically, pointing out their nature as numbers. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed, and it specifies what needs to be clarified. This is fully grounded and specific, so another 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that Fourier modes can be clarified as real or complex numbers. However, there's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. It just states that clarification is needed without backing it up. So, it's not fully verifiable. I'll mark this as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and directly points out a specific improvement. It guides the authors without being vague. Even though it doesn't provide examples or references, it's still helpful because it's actionable.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests changing Figure 5.1 to Figure 1 and mentions moving the LaTeX label. This is explicit because it tells the author exactly what to do. The action is clear and doesn't require the author to infer. Also, it provides concrete details about where to make the change. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"Fig. 1\" and \"Fig. 5.1\" by number, which is specific. It also mentions LaTeX specifics, which are clear instructions. There's no ambiguity about which part of the paper is being addressed. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any justification. It doesn't explain why changing the figure number or moving the label is necessary or how it improves the paper. There's no reference to standards or logical reasoning provided. Therefore, it's only somewhat verifiable because it does mention the fix, but lacks the supporting evidence needed to fully verify the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment provides a specific fix for a formatting issue, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer broader advice or ask for clarification, so it's somewhat helpful. It's clear and actionable, but could be more comprehensive if it included additional suggestions or context.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says to add a reference next to baseline names in tables and mentions that \u03a9 isn't explicitly defined but is easy to infer. For actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The first part about adding a reference next to names is explicit because it tells the author exactly what to do. The second part about \u03a9 being inferred is a bit vague because it doesn't specify how to define \u03a9. So, it's not fully actionable because one part is clear, and the other is vague. But since it's mostly giving clear instructions, I think it's a 5 because the main action is explicit, and the vague part is minor.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment doesn't mention any specific part of the paper except tables. It talks about adding references and mentions \u03a9 but doesn't specify where or what exactly. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or element. However, it does imply the tables since that's where the reference is needed. But since it's not explicit, I'd rate this as 3 because it partially identifies the area but isn't fully specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment suggests adding a reference and mentions \u03a9. It doesn't provide any justification or examples for why this is necessary or how it helps. There's no logical reasoning or references given, so it's not verifiable. I think this should be a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable if you consider the suggestion, but without supporting evidence, it's not fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review gives clear suggestions about adding references and clarifying \u03a9. It's helpful because it directly points out areas for improvement without being too vague. However, it could be more detailed, like explaining why \u03a9 is important or providing examples. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly helpful with clear suggestions but could be improved with more justification.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores make sense based on each aspect's criteria.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the caption for Figure 7 is incorrect and should be \"Edge Dynamics\" instead of \"Node Dynamics\". This is pretty explicit, so it's an explicit action. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly which part to change and what to change it to. There's no ambiguity here, so it's definitely actionable. Therefore, this should be a high score, probably 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions that the caption is incorrect and specifies the correct term. It doesn't say \"Figure 7 caption is wrong\" but directly points out what it should be. So, the grounding is explicit because it clearly references the figure. It also specifies what needs to be changed, which adds specificity. Therefore, this should also be a high score, likely 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the caption is incorrect and suggests a specific fix. However, there's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's just a statement of what should be done without backing it up. So, this doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability. It's more of a directive without justification, so it should be a low score, probably 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issue and provides a specific fix. It's actionable and gives the authors a clear next step. While it doesn't go into why the caption is wrong or how common the issue is, it's still helpful because it directly addresses the problem. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive. Therefore, a score of 4 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests discussing case studies and error studies to highlight effectiveness. It gives an example but doesn't specify how to implement it. So, the action is explicit\u2014discussing case studies\u2014but the implementation is vague. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific methods like case studies and error studies and references a particular example. It accurately points to the section where the example can be found, so this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review presents a claim that discussing case studies would make the argument more convincing. It provides a rationale by mentioning an example but doesn't cite external references or logical reasoning beyond the example. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully, making it **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions and provides an example, which is helpful. However, it's not the most detailed, so it's **4: Mostly Helpful** because it gives meaningful feedback but could be expanded.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the standard deviation isn't provided and that the improvement from SoRA is limited due to random fluctuations. It suggests clarifying which effects are within the standard deviation and which are improvements. The action is explicit\u2014suggesting clarification\u2014but it's vague on how to do that. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out exactly what steps to take. That would make it a 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points out a specific part of the paper\u2014the experimental section\u2014and mentions an issue with standard deviation. It also suggests clarifying effects, which is specific. So, it's fully grounded because it clearly references the section and the issue without needing more context. That's a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that the lack of standard deviation and the limited improvement are due to random fluctuations. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning to support this claim. It's a bit vague, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. That would be a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review does suggest specific areas for improvement and points out clear issues. It's helpful because it guides the authors on what to look for, but it could be more detailed. So, it's mostly helpful, which is a 4.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is clear but not entirely actionable or well-supported, so the scores make sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I remember that it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment points out two issues: replacing \"known\" with \"know\" and defining \\gamma_0^{***}, and also asks about the colors in a figure. \n\nFor the first part, replacing a word, that's straightforward. The reviewer is giving a specific edit. But then, asking to define a variable is a bit vague. It doesn't tell the author exactly how to define it or where to look. So, while the first part is explicit, the second part is more implicit. Also, the third part is about a figure, but it's just a request without specifics. \n\nI think the first part is actionable, but the other parts are a bit unclear. So maybe it's not fully actionable because some parts aren't explicit or detailed enough. But I'm not sure if it's borderline or not.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. This is about how specific the comment is. The comment mentions specific lines and a figure, which is good. It tells the author exactly where to focus, like line 148 and 156, and Figure 1. That's pretty specific. It doesn't just say \"improve the paper\" but points to exact spots. So I think this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment has claims, like suggesting to replace a word and define a variable. But does it support these claims? For the first part, replacing \"known\" with \"know\" is a straightforward edit, so that's clear. But defining \\gamma_0^{***} is vague. The author isn't told where to get the definition or how to implement it. As for the figure, there's no justification or references provided. So the claim about defining the variable lacks support, and the figure part doesn't have any backing. Therefore, it's not fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does identify specific areas for improvement and provides clear edits. The first two points are direct and actionable. The third part, about the figure, is a bit vague but still offers a direction. Overall, it's helpful because it guides the author on what needs fixing, even if some parts aren't as detailed as they could be. So I'd rate it as highly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the comment is highly actionable and grounded, not fully verifiable, and highly helpful. But I'm a bit uncertain about the actionability because some parts are unclear. Maybe it's a 5 because the majority of the points are actionable, but I'm not entirely sure if it's fully actionable or just somewhat.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

The proposed method consists of two major components: generative shape model and the word parsing model. It is unclear which component contributes to the performance gain. Since the proposed approach follows detection-parsing paradigm, it is better to evaluate on baseline detection or parsing techniques separately to better support the claim.\n\n## Aspect: actionability\n\n**Actionability Label:** 3\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Review Point:** The review comment is pointing out that it's unclear which component of the method contributes to the performance gain and suggests evaluating baseline techniques separately.\n\n2. **Determine Explicitness:** The comment explicitly states that it's unclear which component contributes to the performance gain. It also suggests evaluating baseline techniques, which is a direct action.\n\n3. **Assess Concreteness:** The comment provides a clear action: evaluating baseline techniques separately. It doesn't leave room for interpretation or ask the authors to figure out how to apply the action themselves.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the action is explicitly stated and clearly defined, the review point is somewhat actionable (label 3). It's not fully actionable because it doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to evaluate the components further, but it does give a specific direction for the authors to take.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"It is not clear how the method behaves without Lipschitz Hessian assumption.\" The user is pointing out a lack of clarity about the method's behavior under a specific condition. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the review gives a clear instruction on what to do. In this case, the reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't suggesting any specific action. They're just stating that the method's behavior isn't clear without that assumption. So, this isn't explicit; it's more of an implicit comment. Since the reviewer isn't telling the authors what to do or how to fix it, it's not actionable. Therefore, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review mentions \"Lipschitz Hessian assumption,\" which is a specific term, but it's not clear which part of the paper or method this refers to. The reviewer is making a general comment without pinning down exactly where the issue is. So, the grounding isn't strong because the authors can't pinpoint the exact section or issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity would also be 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review is making a judgment that the method's behavior isn't clear without the assumption. Now, verifiability checks if the claim is supported. The reviewer is stating an opinion that the method's behavior is unclear, but there's no justification or evidence provided. They're not backing this up with references or logical reasoning. So, this claim isn't well-supported, making it unverifiable. Hence, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a potential issue but doesn't offer any suggestions or solutions. They're just pointing out that the method's behavior isn't clear without the assumption. Without any actionable steps or explanations on how to address this, the review isn't particularly helpful. It's more of a critique without providing direction, so helpfulness is 1.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated as 1 because the review doesn't provide explicit actions, specific grounding, verifiable claims, or helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking about the rationale behind two modules in a figure. It's not giving any specific instructions on how to modify the code or improve the model. It's more of a question, so the actionability label should be 1 because it's not providing any actionable steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review point mentions \"Figure 1\" and asks about specific modules. It does provide a clear reference to the figure, so that's grounding. It also specifies parts (a) and (b), which adds specificity. So the grounding_specificity label is 3 because it's grounded but not super specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review point is just asking questions without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It doesn't explain why these modules are important or provide references. So it's unverifiable, which gives it an X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review point is a bit vague. It's asking questions but doesn't provide clear answers or context. It might help the authors understand the rationale but doesn't guide them on how to improve. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully, making it a 3.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review isn't very helpful because it doesn't give clear instructions, but it does ask relevant questions about the figure.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Table 4 is incomplete. It should include the results for all four datasets.\" I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what needs to be done. It doesn't ask them to infer anything; they know exactly which table to fix. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies that Table 4 needs to include results from all four datasets. So, it's not just a vague suggestion but a clear action. I think this should be a 4 because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment says \"Table 4 is incomplete.\" Without more context, the authors might not know which part of the paper Table 4 refers to. They might have to guess where it is. Since it doesn't mention anything specific about the table, like its section or unique aspects, it's not fully grounded. So, it's somewhere between weakly grounded and not grounded. I'll give it a 3 because it's not fully clear but could be obvious if they know where the table is.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the table is incomplete. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It just states the problem without supporting it with references or logical reasoning. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1 because there's no backing to make it helpful for the authors.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out that Table 4 is incomplete and suggests adding results for all four datasets. It's clear and actionable, so it should be helpful. It's not vague or minimal, so it's more than a 2. I think a 3 is appropriate here because while it's helpful, it could be expanded to include more details, but as it stands, it's somewhat helpful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

However, the assumption that PCC is a more relaxed constraint compared with KL divergence because of its invariance to scale and shift is not convincing enough. The constraint strength of a loss function is defined via its gradient distribution. For example, KL divergence and MSE loss have the same optimal solution while MSE loss is stricter than KL because of stricter punishment according to its gradient distribution. From this perspective, it is necessary to provide the gradient comparison between KL and PCC.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The comment is explicit about wanting an explanation. However, it's vague on how to explain it\u2014whether through more details, experiments, or something else. So, it's not fully actionable because the method isn't specified. That would be a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer points out a specific concern about the transformer's no-locality but doesn't clearly specify what needs to be addressed. They ask for an explanation but don't tell the authors exactly where or how to improve. So, it's not fully grounded. That's also a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the transformer's no-locality isn't a concern because of limited speed and neighborhood interactions. They don't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's a subjective opinion without backing, so it's unverifiable. That's a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment raises a valid concern and asks for an explanation, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Some figures are not self-explanatory. For instance, in Figure 4, the line of No adapt or Finetune are covered by other lines, without additional explanation.\" It explicitly mentions that the figures aren't self-explanatory and gives an example of Figure 4. That seems like a clear action, so it's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It suggests improving the figures but doesn't specify how. So it's somewhat actionable. I think that's a 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to \"some figures\" and \"Figure 4\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or why the figures are problematic. It's a bit vague. So the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section. But it does mention what needs fixing, so it's somewhat grounded. That's another 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes a judgment that the figures aren't self-explanatory and provides an example. It doesn't cite external references or logical reasoning, but it's clear. So it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem and gives an example, which is helpful. It doesn't suggest major changes, so it's not super helpful, but it's better than nothing.

That sounds like a clear action, so it's explicit. Also, it gives a concrete direction on how to implement the change. So, this should be highly actionable.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The technical contribution is limited, i.e., there is no significant technical contribution and extension based on a typical model for the cross-domain recommendation setting.\" Hmm, the reviewer is pointing out that the technical contribution is limited. They mention that there's no significant technical contribution and that it's an extension based on a typical model. \n\nNow, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is stating that the technical contribution is limited, but they don't specify what needs to be done next. They're not giving explicit instructions on how to improve the technical contribution. So, it's more of an implicit statement. That would fall under borderline actionable because the action is there, but it's vague on how to apply it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This is about how specific the review is in addressing a part of the paper. The reviewer says the technical contribution is limited, but they don't specify which part of the paper this refers to. They mention cross-domain recommendation setting but don't pin it down to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the referenced part. It's not fully grounded either because they don't provide specific details about what's missing.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review contains a claim that the technical contribution is limited. The justification provided is that there's no significant technical contribution and it's an extension based on a typical model. This seems logical and uses common knowledge about typical models in recommendation settings. So, the claim is well-supported with clear reasoning and references to common practices. That makes it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a limitation in the technical contribution but doesn't suggest specific improvements or how to address this issue. It's clear and identifies a problem, but without concrete suggestions, it's not very helpful. It's more of a warning without actionable steps, so it's somewhat helpful but not highly so.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is scored based on these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The authors do not give a comprehensive discussion of previous work on this topic.\" Hmm, this is pointing out a problem, but it's not suggesting what the authors should do to fix it. It doesn't provide any specific actions or steps. So, it's not explicit because it's more of a statement rather than a clear instruction. It's also not concrete because it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. Therefore, it's unactionable. So, actionability label is 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is. The comment says the authors didn't discuss previous work comprehensively. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is missing. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or element. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim because it's stating that the authors didn't discuss previous work well. But does it support this claim? It just says they didn't, without any justification or references. There's no logical reasoning or external sources provided. So, it's unverifiable. Verifiability label is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a problem but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve their work. So, it's not very helpful. Therefore, helpfulness is 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is unhelpful, ungrounded, unverifiable, and unactionable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out several questions and suggestions. It asks whether the OT sample selection runs once or iteratively, whether the training steps and OT solving are done by turns iteratively, and inquires about the runtime for solving the OT problem and OT sample selection. These are all specific questions that the authors can address. The suggestions are clear and direct, so the action is explicit. Since the comments are explicit and provide clear instructions on what to do, this should be highly actionable. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific sections of the paper, like section 2.4.3 and equation (3). It also mentions the training steps and the OT problem, which are specific parts of the methodology. The grounding is strong because it accurately points to the relevant sections and concepts without needing too much interpretation. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes several claims. It suggests that the review point adds value by asking specific questions and requesting details. However, the justifications provided are somewhat vague. For example, it mentions that readers might find it easier to understand with a flow chart but doesn't provide an external reference or specific example. The reasoning is clear but lacks depth in supporting evidence. So, this is somewhat verifiable, which would be a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is quite detailed, listing multiple questions and requests for information. It helps the authors by pointing out areas where more clarity is needed and suggests ways to improve the paper. While it's thorough, it could be expanded further, but it's definitely helpful. So, a 4 seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

So, it's not giving clear actions or details. It's more of an opinion without concrete steps, which makes it unactionable. So, I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about human evaluation but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper or explain why metrics are misleading. It's too vague about what needs fixing. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the issue. I'd give it a 1 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions that automatic metrics can be misleading but doesn't provide any evidence or references to support this claim. It's just stating an opinion without justification, so it's not verifiable. That's a 1 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment suggests using human evaluation but doesn't provide specific advice or details on how to implement it. It's vague and doesn't offer actionable steps, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful. I'd rate this as 2.\n\nOverall, the review is opinionated but lacks specific actions, grounding, or verifiable evidence, so it's not very helpful for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

For the paper to be useful, the problem considered should be well motivated.\n\n###Evaluation:\n\n**Actionability:**\n- The review explicitly states that the paper lacks motivation and uses static datasets. This is an explicit action.\n- However, it doesn\u2019t provide concrete steps or examples on how to improve the motivation or datasets. Therefore, it\u2019s somewhat actionable.\n\n**Grounding Specificity:**\n- The review mentions the lack of motivation and static datasets but doesn\u2019t specify which part of the paper (e.g., introduction, methodology) needs improvement. It\u2019s weakly grounded because it implies but doesn\u2019t name the sections.\n\n**Verifiability:**\n- The claim is that the paper lacks motivation and uses static datasets. The justification is general and doesn\u2019t reference external sources or provide logical reasoning. It\u2019s somewhat verifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\n- The review provides clear feedback on areas needing improvement but lacks specific suggestions or examples. It\u2019s somewhat helpful as it guides the authors to enhance their work but doesn\u2019t offer detailed guidance.\n\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The GAT is trained with the whole model? Needs to be reviewed by a English native speaker and some sentences need to be rewriting for improving the clarity.\" \n\nFirst, I check if it's explicit or implicit. The first part, \"The GAT is trained with the whole model?\" seems like a question, which could be explicit if it's giving a direct instruction. But it's phrased as a question, so maybe it's more of a suggestion. Then, it says \"some sentences need to be rewriting,\" which is a clear instruction. So, it's giving direct actions, but the first part is a bit ambiguous. Since it's a question, it might be inferred, making it implicit. So, maybe it's borderline actionable because it's not entirely clear what action to take.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It just mentions the GAT and the need for review and rewriting. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the section or figure. It's more of a general statement, so it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that the GAT needs to be reviewed and rewritten. But there's no supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement without justification, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does suggest improvements but is vague. It tells the authors what needs to be done but doesn't provide specific examples or deeper reasoning. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these observations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

However, the suggestions are vague and lack specific details on how to implement these changes. The comment is explicit in pointing out the need for actions but does not provide concrete guidance on how to address the gap or fine-tune the model.  \n   - **Score**: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - The review mentions \"some datasets are closer to each other\" and \"synthetic data.\" While it references specific parts of the paper (datasets and synthetic data), it does not clearly identify which specific section or figure is affected by the dataset gap. The grounding is weak because the authors cannot confidently pinpoint the exact area needing improvement.  \n   - **Score**: 3 (Weakly Grounded and Specific)\n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   - The review contains a claim about the dataset gap and suggests fine-tuning a pre-trained model.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions Figure 3 and 4 but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It talks about quantitative results not reflecting final outputs and mentions a single data sample in Figure 4. The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving clear instructions on how to fix it. So, it's explicit that there's an issue but vague on the action. That sounds like it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear there's an action needed, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 3 and 4 by name, which is pretty specific. It's not just saying \"the results are bad\" but pointing out exact figures. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the parts being discussed. The specificity is also good because it mentions the figures and the issue with the final outputs. I think this would be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the quantitative comparison isn't convincing enough. They're suggesting an improvement but not providing evidence or reasoning to back it up. There's no external reference or logical justification given. So, this is **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's a claim, but it's not well-supported.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a problem but doesn't offer a clear solution or suggest improvements. They mention the figures but don't explain how to enhance the model's performance. This is somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because there's some feedback, but it's incomplete.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is clear about the issue but lacks detailed actions and support, so the scores make sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point mentions several questions about the techniques and parameters involved, like the sparsification process, landmark extraction, image features, and so on. It seems like the reviewer is providing explicit instructions on what needs to be done. However, the questions are quite detailed and might require the authors to infer how to implement each step. For example, they ask about the fixed radius with different scales, which could be something the authors need to figure out themselves. So, while the reviewer is being explicit about the areas needing improvement, the instructions are somewhat vague on the implementation details. I think this falls under \"Explicit but with some vagueness,\" so maybe a 4 or 5. But since the questions are clear about what needs to be done, I'll lean towards 5 because the reviewer is being direct, even if the implementation isn't fully spelled out.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer points out specific issues related to the techniques and parameters used. They mention the sparsification process, landmark extraction, image features, and the fixed radius with different scales. This seems like the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the parts of the paper that need attention. They're not just making general comments but are specifically addressing certain sections or methods. Additionally, they're asking about the number of landmarks and the types of features, which are specific aspects of the methodology. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific,\" giving it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making several claims about the lack of detail in the techniques and the importance of certain parameters. However, they don't provide any supporting evidence or references. They're just stating that the techniques are unclear and that certain parameters are important without backing this up. This means the claims are not well-supported, so it's probably a \"Somewhat Verifiable\" score, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is clearly pointing out specific areas where the authors need to improve their methodology. They're asking detailed questions about the techniques and parameters, which should help the authors make significant improvements. While the questions are quite extensive, they're actionable in the sense that they guide the authors to look into specific aspects of their work. Therefore, this should be a high score, probably a 5 because the feedback is thorough and guides the authors effectively.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the scores are actionability: 5, grounding_specificity: 5, verifiability: 3, and helpfulness: 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding error bars and more random trials to Figure 1. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies exactly what to add. So this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 1 but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It just says \"the paper\" which is vague. So the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the section. But it does suggest what needs fixing, which is specific. So I'd rate this as 3 because grounding is weak but specificity is okay.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting improvements but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a recommendation without supporting evidence. So it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does suggest specific changes, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't explain why these changes are necessary or how they'll improve the results. So while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully detailed. I'd rate this a 4 because it's helpful but could be more comprehensive.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests adding an introduction to energy models in the Related Work section and clarifying the learning rates in Figure 1. Both of these are explicit actions the authors should take. The comment doesn't ask them to do something vague like \"improve the paper,\" it specifically tells them what to do. So, this is explicit. Now, are these actions clear? The introduction is straightforward, and clarifying the figure's labels is also direct. There's no ambiguity about what needs to be done. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while the actions are explicit, maybe they could be more detailed, but they're definitely clear.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions the Related Work section and Figure 1. It doesn't specify which part of the Related Work or the figure needs clarification. The authors have to figure it out themselves. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part. However, it does identify the sections, so it's not completely ungrounded. The specificity about the figure's labels is clear, but since the overall grounding is weak, I'd rate this as **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding an introduction and clarifying the figure. Adding an introduction is a general statement, so it's not a claim. The part about clarifying the figure's labels is a suggestion, which is a claim. Now, is this claim supported? The suggestion is clear, but it doesn't provide specific references or logical reasoning. It's more of a request than a claim that needs justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's an explanation, but it's not fully justified. Therefore, **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment provides two suggestions: adding context about energy models and clarifying the figure's labels. Both are actionable and specific. The suggestions are clear and directly address potential issues the authors might have. While it doesn't go into depth about why these changes are important, it's still helpful because it guides the authors on what to improve. So, this should be **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and actionable, but maybe a bit broad in its suggestions.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores make sense based on the explicitness, specificity, verifiability, and overall helpfulness of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I remember that it's about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The review mentions that FIITED uses a utility-based approach but suggests that relying solely on utility scores might cause biases. It gives an example about recent chunks having high utility and potentially being evicted. But does this tell the authors exactly what to change? It seems like it's pointing out a potential issue but doesn't specify how to fix it. So, it's not explicit enough. Maybe it's borderline actionable because it hints at a problem but doesn't provide a clear solution. So, I'd rate it as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity** looks at whether the review clearly references specific parts of the paper. The review talks about FIITED's approach but doesn't mention any specific sections or tables. It just describes the method. So, the authors wouldn't know exactly where the issue is. That means it's not fully grounded because it doesn't pinpoint the problem. I think this falls under weak grounding with some specificity, so a 3 seems right.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that relying on utility scores introduces biases. But it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's making a judgment without justification. So, it's not verifiable. I'd give it a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable if it had some justification, but it doesn't.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness** assesses how useful the review is. The review does point out a potential issue and gives an example, which is helpful. However, it doesn't suggest specific fixes or improvements. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, a 3 makes sense here as well.\n\nOverall, each aspect is only partially addressed, so the scores are all 3s.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the claims in the introduction don't match what's achieved, and suggests toning down the intro and not calling it language learning. It's a bit vague about what exactly needs to be changed. So, it's not explicit enough, which would make it borderline actionable. I think it's a 3 because it's clear there's a problem but doesn't specify how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the claims not matching the tasks and models, but it's a bit vague about which part of the paper it's addressing. It also suggests changing the intro and terminology, which isn't very specific. So, it's weakly grounded because it's not pinpointing the exact section, and it's not specific about what needs fixing. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that the intro doesn't match the tasks and suggests a change in terminology.

That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out a mismatch between claims and results and suggests improvements. It's actionable in that it tells the authors to tone down the intro and not use the term language learning. It's somewhat helpful because it gives a direction but could be more detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that kernels are implemented with OpenAI's Triton, not CUDA, and mentions that a full-page explanation isn't necessary because of known engineering improvements. I think this is explicit because it directly states the implementation choice and the reasoning behind it. It doesn't ask the authors to infer anything; it's straightforward. So, it's definitely actionable because the authors can see exactly what was done and why. Also, the reasoning is clear, so it's concrete. I don't see any issues here, so I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions OpenAI's Triton and CUDA, which are specific technologies, and it refers to known engineering improvements. It doesn't just say \"it's implemented with something,\" but rather names the specific implementations and the reason for it. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the parts being addressed. It's also specific because it explains why a full-page isn't needed. I think this is a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the kernels are implemented with OpenAI's Triton and that engineering improvements are known. It doesn't provide any external references or citations, but the claims are based on common knowledge\u2014most people would know about OpenAI's Triton and CUDA. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's supported by general knowledge, but without specific examples or references, it's not fully robust. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review explains the implementation choice and the reasoning behind not needing a full-page explanation. It's clear and provides useful information for the authors. While it doesn't go into every possible detail, it's comprehensive enough to be helpful. I think this deserves a 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a score based on the evaluation above.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions several points like the transferability of the policy and the difficulty of transferring from simpler to complex tasks. It suggests making this clear in the paper. The comment is explicit about the issues but doesn't provide specific steps on how to address them. It's vague on how to improve the transferability. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to do next. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear there's a problem but lacks detail on the fix.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out that the transferability might be limited due to task difficulty. It mentions specific tasks like Walker-run being harder than Walker-walk and the number of rotation prongs. The comment accurately identifies the parts of the paper being addressed, like the policy transfer and task complexity. It also clearly specifies what needs improvement, which is making the transferability clear. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that transferring policies from simpler to complex tasks is difficult. It supports this with examples like the number of rotation prongs, which are specific tasks. The reasoning is logical, and the examples are clear. So, this is thoroughly supported, making it \"Fully Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues and provides clear suggestions. It doesn't go into unnecessary details but covers important aspects. The feedback is actionable and constructive, so it's \"Mostly Helpful.\" It doesn't ask for more information or make vague claims, so it's quite helpful for the authors.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors haven't covered more on the types of activities in datasets, especially regarding occupant comfort and energy efficiency. It doesn't specify what the authors should do next. So, it's not explicit or implicit because there's no clear action suggested. It's just pointing out a deficiency without providing direction. That means it's **unactionable**, so the label is 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions datasets and occupant comfort/energy efficiency but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section it's referring to. It's vague about pinpointing the exact issue. So, the authors can't confidently identify where the problem lies. This falls under weak grounding because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or element. Therefore, the label is 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about the authors' lack of coverage on activity types and their importance. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable, which gives it a label of 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a deficiency and suggests the authors need to cover more on activity types. It's clear and provides some actionable feedback. However, it doesn't go into specifics like how to improve or what changes to make. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. The label here is 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable and helpful but lacks grounding and verifiability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"D\" is used to represent both dimensionality of points and dilation factor. Better to use different notation to avoid confusion. I remember that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the comment is pointing out a specific issue with the notation, suggesting a better alternative. It's explicit about the problem and provides a clear solution, so that's good. It doesn't seem vague or unclear. So, I'd say this is highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to change and how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment again talks about \"D\" causing confusion. It doesn't mention any specific part of the paper or where exactly the issue is. It's more of a general suggestion. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint where the problem is. It doesn't provide enough detail about what needs to be addressed, so I'd rate this as weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment suggests using different notation, which is a clear judgment. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references for why current notation is problematic or why a different notation is better. It's just a suggestion without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing for the claim. It should be an X since there's no claim without justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does suggest a change, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, so the authors can easily understand what to do. However, it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback. It could be expanded, but as it stands, it's helpful. So, I'd give it a 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be improved.\n\nWait, but the initial evaluation said grounding_specificity was 5, which doesn't make sense because the comment didn't ground it. Maybe I made a mistake there. Let me double-check. The comment doesn't specify where the issue is, so grounding should be weak. So, I think I need to adjust that to 1 or 2. Maybe 2 because it's clear where the issue is (D notation), but it's not explicitly stated. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. I'll stick with 1 because it's not clearly identifying the part of the paper.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 5, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability X, helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It suggests that the innovative part should be detailed. The action here is clear: the authors need to elaborate on the innovative aspect. However, the instruction is a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly what needs to be detailed or how to elaborate. So, it's not fully actionable but provides a direction. That would score a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to the FRM as a combination of two attention mechanisms but doesn't specify which parts of the paper or sections it's addressing. It's not pointing to a particular section or figure, so the grounding is weak. It mentions the innovative part should be detailed but doesn't specify what that entails. Therefore, it's weakly grounded but somewhat specific about needing detail. This gives a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the FRM is simple and suggests adding detail. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is the case or how the detail should be added. There's no reference to external literature or logical reasoning, so it's not verifiable. This scores a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review points out a potential weakness in the FRM and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are vague\u2014just saying to elaborate without specifics. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth, so it's a 3.\n\nOverall, the review is somewhat actionable and grounded but lacks clarity and evidence, making it somewhat helpful but not fully so.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the authors don't foresee negative social impacts but the reviewer isn't sure if they should review that aspect. It suggests mentioning social impacts of automation or dual use risks. Hmm, so the reviewer is giving some suggestions, but are they explicit? They do say \"I'm not quite sure if/how I'm meant to review this aspect,\" which might mean they're not clear on their own role. The suggestions are there, but they're vague about how the authors should implement them. So, it's not fully explicit. It's somewhat actionable because the reviewer is pointing out areas to consider, but it's not clear how the authors should proceed. So, I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about increased automation and dual use risks. They're referring to external factors beyond the paper itself. They're not pointing to a specific section or figure, but rather general issues. So, the grounding is weak because they're not pinning down exactly where the problem is in the paper. The specificity about what needs fixing is there, but the grounding is weak. So, this would be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The reviewer is making a claim that the authors should consider social impacts, but they're not providing any evidence or justification for why this is important. They're just stating an opinion without backing it up. So, there's no supporting reasoning or references, making it unverifiable. Therefore, the verifiability score is 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer is offering some suggestions but not clearly explaining why they're important or how they apply. They're pointing out potential areas without giving a strong rationale. The suggestions are there, but they're vague and not well-supported, so the helpfulness isn't great. It's more than just a comment, but it's not fully constructive. So, I'd rate this as 3 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is a 3 because they either lack explicitness, weak grounding, lack of support, or are somewhat helpful but not fully so.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

So, I'd rate it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the notation but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's unclear whether it's pointing to a particular section or figure. Since it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part, it's only weakly grounded. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests an alternative notation but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a suggestion without backing, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out an issue and suggests an alternative, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the methods' applicability is limited because of strong assumptions about camera parameters. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They know the methods have limitations but aren't guided on how to improve them. So, it's not explicit because the action isn't directly suggested. It's more of an implicit comment. Since it's not giving clear steps, it's probably borderline actionable. So, I'd give it a 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about camera parameters (extrinsics and intrinsics) and object segmentation. It mentions specific parts of the paper but doesn't clearly state what needs fixing. The authors might have to infer which sections are affected. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't explicitly point out the exact issues. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that the methods are limited due to assumptions. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a judgment without backing. So, it's unverifiable.

The suggestion is clear but lacks guidance on the exact method or steps the authors should take.  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   The review point explicitly mentions the specific part of the paper (core tensors and their rounding) and provides a clear question about the approximation error.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the form of 'p' should be described near line 135 but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It says the author assumes it's a Gaussian distribution but doesn't confirm or explain how to verify this. Since the action is explicit (describing 'p' near line 135) but lacks details on how to confirm the assumption, it's **Somewhat Actionable** (label 3).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to line 135 but doesn't explicitly mention the section or figure. It's vague about what needs to be addressed. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact part of the paper. Therefore, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** (label 3).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests that 'p' is a Gaussian distribution but doesn't provide any justification or references.

The review mentions that the results have an exponential dependence on the diameter M, which is a weakness. It also suggests that the authors should consider alternative approaches. These are both explicit actions, so that's good. But the explanation is a bit vague about how to fix it, like suggesting alternatives without specifics. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to do next. Maybe a 4?\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity** looks at whether the review points to a specific part of the paper. The review talks about Eq. (3) and mentions figures and theorems, but it's quite general. It doesn't pin down a specific section or figure, so it's not fully grounded. It's more about the overall approach rather than a particular part. So, maybe a 3?\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the exponential dependence and suggests alternative approaches. It doesn't provide much justification or references, so it's not fully verifiable. It's more of a statement than a claim with supporting evidence. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**.

It also points out that poor performance could be due to oversmoothing, referencing a specific paper. The action here is pointing out issues and suggesting another factor. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to change or how to fix it. So, it's explicit in pointing out problems but lacks concrete steps. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear but not detailed enough.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review references a specific paper, which is good. It also mentions \"another phenomenon observed in the context of very deep graph networks,\" which is a bit vague. The grounding is there, but the specificity about what exactly is being discussed isn't very clear. So, it's weakly grounded but somewhat specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides a claim that there are multiple reasons for poor performance. It supports this by mentioning a specific paper, which is helpful. However, the explanation is a bit vague and doesn't go into depth about how oversmoothing affects performance. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's some justification but not enough detail.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review does point out two issues and references another study, which is useful.

It's somewhat helpful because it identifies problems but doesn't guide the authors on improvements.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is only partially met, so they all get a 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests comparing the proposed method with existing ones like generalized Voronoi graphs, semantic maps, pose graphs in SLAM, and curiosity-driven exploration. It also mentions discussing the method in relation to these. The comment is explicit about the action, which is to compare with other methods. However, it's a bit vague on exactly how to implement this comparison. It doesn't specify whether they should be discussed in detail or just mentioned. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specifics on how to execute it.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions several existing methods but doesn't pin down exactly which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. It does, however, clearly specify what needs to be addressed, which is a comparison with other methods. So, it's not fully grounded but does identify the issue clearly. I think this is \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it can't confidently identify the exact part but clearly states what needs fixing.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests comparing with existing methods and cites some literature. However, the references are not explicitly provided, and the reasoning is a bit vague. It mentions loop closure in graph-based SLAM but doesn't cite the appendix section. This makes the justification somewhat unclear and incomplete. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting a comparison with existing methods and mentions specific areas like topological reasoning and SLAM techniques. It provides a direction for the authors to take. While it's not the most detailed, it's still helpful and guides the authors on what needs improvement. I think this is \"Mostly Helpful\" because it's clear and actionable, though it could be expanded a bit more.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, the review is somewhat actionable, weakly grounded but specific, somewhat verifiable, and mostly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions specific points about vit quantification but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. It talks about comparing methods and referencing other works, but it doesn't give clear steps or fixes. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 or 4?\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific papers and methods, which is good. It points out that other works have similar issues, so the authors can look into those. That seems pretty grounded. Maybe a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides references and specific comparisons. It's clear and backed by examples, so this should be fully verifiable. That would be a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does give some specific points and references, which helps the authors understand issues and where to look. It's not the most detailed, but it's helpful enough. Maybe a 4 or 5. Since it's fully verifiable and grounded, and provides specific examples, I'd lean towards 5.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think all four aspects are at least a 5, except maybe actionability which I'm a bit unsure about. But since it does mention specific comparisons, maybe it's a 4. But the initial thought was 5 for all. Maybe I should stick with 5 for actionability as well since it does provide clear directions on what to compare.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The comment says, \"L384: Could mention that you mean |Y_t - Y_{t-1}| \\leq c_t almost surely.\" and \"L431: \\mu_t should be \\tilde \\mu_t, yes?\" \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The first part suggests adding a clarification, which is explicit. The second part is a yes/no question, which implies the need to change something but doesn't specify how. So, the first part is explicit and concrete, but the second is more implicit. However, both are actionable. I think this is highly actionable because both are clear actions the authors can take, even if the second one doesn't specify the exact change. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to specific lines, L384 and L431, which are precise. It also mentions the mathematical expressions, which are specific parts of the paper. So, the comment is fully grounded because it accurately points to the sections being addressed. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment contains claims. The first part suggests adding a clarification, which is a claim that needs justification. The second part is a yes/no question, which is more of a request without a claim. The justification for the first part is implicit because it just says \"could mention\" without explaining why. The second part doesn't provide any reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's some justification, but it's not fully supported. I'll rate it a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment provides specific suggestions and refers to exact lines and equations. It's clear and actionable, which helps the authors improve their work. While it could be more detailed, it's already quite helpful. So, I'll give it a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that Eq. 12 is confusing and asks where the reward comes from. It also suggests explaining the network model with equations. The explicit action here is pointing out the confusion and suggesting a solution. The suggestion is clear, so it's explicit. The details are concrete because it specifies Eq. 12 and the need for equations in Sec. 4.2. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Eq. 12 and Sec. 4.2, which are specific parts of the paper. It doesn't just refer to the paper as a whole but points to exact sections. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections being addressed. The specificity is also good because it clearly states what needs to be addressed in those sections.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that the network model should be explained with equations. The justification is that it would improve clarity, which is a logical reasoning. However, it doesn't provide external references or examples, so it's somewhat justified but lacks depth. Therefore, it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and provides actionable suggestions. It helps the authors by directing them to areas they need to improve. While it doesn't go into too much detail, it's clear and useful, making it highly helpful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a 5 except verifiability, which is somewhat justified but lacks external support, so it's a borderline case. However, since the justification is logical and clear, I'll still rate it as 5 for verifiability as well, following the instructions to rate it as X if borderline but considering the justification is present, it's fully verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out a minor issue on line 32, page 1, where \"Empiically\" should be \"Empirically.\" This is a direct correction, so the action is explicit. The reviewer clearly states what needs to be fixed, and it's straightforward. There's no ambiguity here, so it's highly actionable. I'll give this a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific line and page, which is a clear reference. It doesn't just say \"line 32\" but specifies the exact location. This shows that the reviewer has pinpointed the issue, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is also clear because it directly addresses the typo. I'll rate this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a correction based on common knowledge about correct spelling. While it's a valid claim, there's no external reference or detailed explanation provided. It's more of a factual correction without justification. So, it's not fully verifiable. I'll give this a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides a clear correction but only points out one minor issue. It lacks broader context or suggestions for improvement beyond fixing the typo. While it's helpful, it's not comprehensive.

Let's go through each one step by step.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review point says, \"The novelty of the idea is not enough. In addition to the limitations pointed out above, both new metric and method are relatively straightforward.\" \n\nFirst, I check if it's explicit or implicit. The reviewer is pointing out that the idea's novelty isn't enough, which is an explicit action. However, the part about the metric and method being straightforward is more of an implicit suggestion. The reviewer isn't directly telling the authors how to improve the metric or method, just stating that they're straightforward. So, it's not fully explicit.\n\nNext, is the action concrete? The reviewer mentions the metric and method but doesn't specify how to make them more complex or effective. So, it's vague on the implementation. \n\nBased on the scale, 3 is \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it explicitly states an action but lacks detail on how to implement it.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe review points out the novelty and the straightforwardness of the metric and method. It doesn't explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, like a section or figure. It's more of a general critique. \n\nSince the reviewer isn't pinpointing a specific section or element, the grounding is weak. However, the comment does clearly specify what's wrong (novelty and straightforwardness), so it's somewhat specific.\n\nOn the scale, 3 is \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it doesn't clearly identify the part but does specify the issue.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe comment contains a claim that the idea's novelty isn't enough and that the metric and method are straightforward. \n\nFor verifiability, we need to see if the claim is supported. The reviewer doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back up these statements. They're just opinions or judgments. \n\nSo, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or evidence provided. It falls under \"Unverifiable\" on the scale.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review points out the novelty and the simplicity of the method. While it's helpful to mention the areas needing improvement, it doesn't provide concrete suggestions on how to enhance the metric or method. It's vague and lacks detailed guidance.\n\nOn the helpfulness scale, 3 is \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it does identify some weaknesses but doesn't offer enough actionable advice.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is scored as 3 because they either meet the criteria for that score or fall into the category that aligns with a 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review mentions that the proposed approach doesn't perform as well as Decouple and suggests improvements. It also points out that the trade-off between head and tail categories hasn't been fully explored in the baselines. The reviewer ends by encouraging the authors to continue the work for future submission. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The review does suggest specific improvements, like changing hyper-parameters to improve tail accuracy. It also mentions that the trade-off hasn't been fully investigated, which gives a clear direction for the authors. The explicit instructions are there, and the details are concrete. So, this should be a high score, probably 5.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThis aspect is about how specific the review is regarding the paper's parts. The review refers to the proposed approach, Decouple [Kang et al.], and mentions Table 5. It talks about head and tail categories, which are specific parts of the paper. The reviewer also suggests looking into hyper-parameters, which are specific elements within the model. The review accurately points out specific sections and issues, so this should also be a high score, likely 5.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nVerifiability checks if the review supports its claims with evidence. The review claims that the trade-off between head and tail categories hasn't been fully explored and suggests that adjusting hyper-parameters could improve tail accuracy. It references Decouple [Kang et al.] as a baseline, which is a specific external reference. The reasoning is logical, explaining why the trade-off is important and how adjusting hyper-parameters could help. This provides sufficient justification, so it should be a high score, probably 4 since it's thorough but maybe not the absolute highest.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nHelpfulness is about how useful the review is for the authors. The review provides clear suggestions for improvement, mentions specific areas like Table 5 and hyper-parameters, and offers actionable advice. It also gives context by referencing another study and explaining why the current work is lacking. This makes the feedback very helpful, so a score of 4 seems appropriate because while it's useful, it might not cover all possible areas the authors could need.\n\nOverall, each aspect is well addressed with clear and specific suggestions, making the review quite helpful and thoroughly grounded and verifiable. The actionability is top-notch, so all scores are high but slightly lower than 5 due to minor aspects not being perfect.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests adding a comment about pi being a function and mentions dropping the no-op action. It also asks why not assume the first column is zero. This is pretty explicit, so it's definitely actionable. The reviewer is pointing out specific issues and even suggests a solution, which is great for the authors. There's no ambiguity here; the actions are clear. So, this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about pi being a function and the dimensions not matching because of dropping the no-op action. They also ask why not assume the first column is zero. This is very specific because they're referencing specific parts of the paper (like pi being a function and the structure of X). They're not just making a general comment but directly addressing potential issues in the methodology. So, this should also be a high score, probably 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that dropping the no-op action affects the dimensions and suggests an alternative approach. They're asking why not assume the first column is zero, which implies a judgment about the current approach. To verify this, the reviewer could provide a reference or a logical explanation. While they don't cite external sources, their reasoning is clear and logical. So, it's somewhat verifiable but could be better by including more justification or references. Maybe a score of 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out specific issues and suggesting solutions. They're clear about what's wrong and how it could be improved. While it's a bit vague by asking why not assume the first column is zero without giving a reason, overall, it's helpful because it guides the authors to consider alternative approaches. So, a score of 4 seems appropriate.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. The review is explicit and actionable, specifically references parts of the paper, makes a claim that's somewhat supported by reasoning, and is helpful overall.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The expected counterfactual violates $\\mathcal{P}_2$ stated in Definition 1.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the aspect of actionability. The review mentions that the counterfactual violates a property, but it doesn't specify what needs to be done. It doesn't give an explicit action or suggest a fix. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to address the issue. Therefore, it's unactionable, which is a 1.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment refers to $\\mathcal{P}_2$ in Definition 1, which is specific. It's not just a vague part of the paper but a specific property. So, it's grounded. However, it doesn't explain what the violation means or how to fix it. It's specific about the part but not about the issue. So, it's weakly grounded and not specific, which is a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the counterfactual violates $\\mathcal{P}_2$. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable, a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out an issue but doesn't provide any guidance on how to fix it. It's just pointing out a problem without actionable steps. So, it's not helpful at all, a 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all aspects except grounding, but even there, it's not fully specific.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing the model with Revisiting Visual Question Answering Baselines. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. But is it concrete? The comment doesn't specify how to perform the comparison, like whether they should use the same datasets or metrics. So it's explicit but not very concrete. That would rate it as 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific paper, Revisiting Visual Question Answering Baselines. That's a strong point because it clearly identifies the referenced work. Additionally, it specifies what needs to be done, which is comparing the models. So this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests comparing with a specific baseline. It doesn't provide much justification beyond stating the comparison. There's no clear reasoning or references, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. That would be a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting a comparison with a specific model. It provides a direction for the authors but doesn't go into detail about how to implement it. It's helpful but could be expanded. So it's a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests trimming questions after the first 10 because the model is a bag of words, which isn't efficient for longer sequences. The comment is explicit about the design choice and provides a clear action\u2014trimming the questions. It doesn't just say \"trim,\" though; it explains why. So, it's explicit and gives a direct action. The explanation is concrete because it tells the authors exactly what to do. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the design choice of trimming questions but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It refers to the model being a bag of words, which is a general statement. There's no mention of a specific section or figure, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the issue in the paper, just hints at it. So, I think this should be weakly grounded, maybe a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests trimming questions because the model is a bag of words. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence. So, there's no verifiability here. It should be marked as X because there's no claim or supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific inefficiency in the model design and suggests a practical change. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful for the authors. It doesn't seem vague or lacking in guidance. So, it's highly helpful, giving it a 5.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be actionability 5, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out specific changes that should be made, like changing two lines from red to green in the Supplementary Material. It also lists exact lines and what they should be replaced with, like L502: \u03f5 \u03b8 --> z \u03b8 SuppMat, etc. These are clear instructions, so the author knows exactly what to do. That seems highly actionable because there's no ambiguity about what needs to be fixed. So I'd give this a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific sections like L502, L507, and L509, and what changes should be made, like Algorithm 1. It's not just a general comment; it's pointing to exact spots in the document. This means the author can pinpoint exactly where the changes are needed without guessing. So this is fully grounded and specific. That's another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making claims about the formatting issues in the Supplementary Material. However, it's not providing any justification or evidence for why these changes are necessary. It's just stating what needs to be done without backing it up. So this doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability. I'd rate this as X because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest specific changes, which is helpful. However, it doesn't explain why these changes are important or how they improve the paper. Without justification, the authors might not fully understand the value of the edits. So while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful because it lacks the reasoning behind the suggestions. I think a 5 might be a bit high here, but since it does provide clear instructions, maybe it's still considered highly helpful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores would be actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X, and helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that online learning formulation overlooks practical considerations and suggests comparing against online learning approaches and RL. It also asks specific questions about retraining costs and comparisons. Explicitly, it tells the authors to make these comparisons and asks detailed questions. That seems pretty actionable. The reviewer is giving clear instructions, so I think this is highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific areas like online learning approaches and RL, which are clearly mentioned. It also asks about retraining costs and incremental updates, which are specific parts of the evaluation. The grounding is strong because it accurately points to these sections without needing more context. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that online learning should be compared against RL and other approaches. It provides some reasoning but doesn't cite external references. The justification is logical but lacks specific examples or citations, so it's somewhat verifiable. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is asking the authors to make specific comparisons and asks detailed questions. It's clear and actionable, which is very helpful. It guides the authors without being too vague. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nOverall, the review point is quite comprehensive and provides clear instructions and questions to the authors, making it highly helpful. It's grounded in specific areas and while the verifiability isn't the strongest, the claim is clear and actionable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding experiments in the supplement and summarizes their results. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this\u2014like whether they should include a figure, table, or discussion section. So it's not fully actionable because the method isn't specified. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable,\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the supplement but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's unclear whether it's a figure, table, or discussion. So the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section. The specificity about the experiments' results is good, but without clear grounding, it's not fully specific. So I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It just says to add experiments and summarize results but doesn't explain why this is necessary or how it improves the paper. There's no logical reasoning or references provided, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest an improvement but doesn't specify how to implement it. It's clear that more experiments are needed, but without detailed guidance, the authors might not know where to start. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the specific points made in the review.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The comment says, \"Important references are missing. The GFF[1] and EfficientFCN[2] both aims to implement the fast semantic segmentation method in the encode-decoder architecture. I encourage the authors to have a comprehensive comparison with these work.\" \n\nFirst, is this comment explicit or implicit? It clearly mentions the references and suggests a comparison, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The comment tells the authors exactly what to do: compare their work with GFF and EfficientFCN. It doesn't leave room for interpretation, so it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment references GFF and EfficientFCN by their citations, which are specific. It also mentions the encode-decoder architecture, which is a specific part of their method. The authors can pinpoint exactly where to look for the missing references. So, this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment contains a claim that references are missing and suggests a comparison. The suggestion is supported by pointing to specific works, which is clear and logical. There's no need for external references here since the point is well-known in the field. So, this is fully verifiable, scoring a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment identifies a missing reference issue and provides a clear suggestion to compare with specific works. It's actionable and directly useful, though maybe a bit brief. It's mostly helpful because it could be expanded, but as it stands, it's quite useful. So, a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nOverall, the comment is clear, specific, and provides solid guidance, making it highly actionable and verifiable, and quite helpful overall.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Maybe because the grounding wasn't perfect? Let me check.  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - The review mentions Algorithm 1 and its specific issue with the Vandermonde matrix.  \n   - It refers to the parameters $n$, $k$, and $L$, which are specific parts of the paper.  \n   - It also suggests providing experimental results, which is a clear indication of what needs to be done.  \n   - Therefore, it's **Fully Grounded and Specific (5)**.  \n\n   The initial assessment was \"5\", which aligns.  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   - The claim is that the Vandermonde matrix is ill-conditioned and numerically unstable.  \n   - The justification is based on common knowledge about Vandermonde matrices and numerical stability.  \n   - It provides logical reasoning without needing external references.  \n   - Therefore, it's **Somewhat Verifiable (3)**.  \n\n   The initial assessment was \"3\", which matches.  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   - The review clearly identifies a specific issue with the algorithm and provides actionable suggestions.  \n   - It guides the authors on what to do and why it's important.  \n   - While it could be expanded, it's already quite helpful.  \n   - Therefore, it's **Mostly Helpful (4)**.  \n\n   The initial assessment was \"4\", which is correct.  \n\nAfter re-evaluating, the actionability should actually be **5** because the action is both explicit and concrete. The initial assessment was \"3\", which might have been due to a misinterpretation.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions the scalability issue but doesn't specify how to address it. It's vague on the solution, so it's not explicit. Since the action isn't clear, it's not highly actionable. It's more of a general concern without a concrete fix, so I'd rate it as 2: Borderline Actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about scalability but doesn't mention specific parts of the paper or provide clear guidance on how to solve it. It's too vague, so it's not fully grounded. It's also not specific about what needs fixing. Therefore, it's 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment raises a valid concern about scalability but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That would be a score of 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a significant issue (scalability) and asks for solutions, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete suggestions, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the PSA method requires more computation than baselines and explains how it's done in Algorithm 1. It also suggests comparing computation complexity in the experiment part. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. However, it doesn't give specific steps on how to implement the computation comparison. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to conduct that experiment. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Algorithm 1 and explains the computation process. It doesn't just say \"the paper\" or \"something in the paper,\" so it's pretty specific. It clearly points out where the issue is, which is in Algorithm 1. So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the PSA method requires more computation. It explains how it's done but doesn't provide external references or examples. The explanation is logical but lacks some supporting evidence. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest an improvement area and provides some details on how to compare computation complexity. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't offer a lot of guidance. It's helpful but not the most detailed. So, a 3 here makes sense because it's somewhat helpful but could be expanded.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Now, actionability is about whether the review gives a clear action for the author to take. In this case, the reviewer is asking the author to rewrite a sentence, which is an action. However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify how to rewrite it or what exactly is wrong. So, it's not explicit enough. Therefore, I'd rate this as **1: Unactionable** because the action isn't clearly defined.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This looks at whether the review clearly references a specific part of the paper. The comment mentions \"While a smaller j to simulate more accumulate errors along with the inference steps,\" but it doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. It's too vague. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint where the issue is. Hence, I'd give this a **1: Not Grounded**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion to rewrite the sentence, which is a claim. However, there's no justification or evidence provided for why rewriting is necessary or helpful. It's just a request without any supporting reasoning. So, this is **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing for the suggestion.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking the author to rewrite a sentence but doesn't provide any specific feedback or explanation on why it's unclear or how to improve it. It's helpful in that it's a request, but it lacks depth and clarity. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the comparison is unfair because the baselines lack prior knowledge or language embeddings. It suggests a better comparison should be considered. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the comment is suggesting a change but doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done. It's vague because it just says \"a better comparison should be considered\" without detailing how. So, it's not explicit, which would have been better. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at an action but doesn't provide the details. So, I'd rate this as 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper's part. The review mentions baselines lacking prior knowledge and language embeddings but doesn't clearly point to a specific section or figure in the paper. It's more general, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly what's missing. Therefore, it's weakly grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Since it's not fully specific either, I'd give it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting a better comparison but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the current comparison is unfair or why a better one would be valid. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's unverifiable. That means it doesn't help the authors verify the validity of their current approach, so I'd rate this as 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment suggests a better comparison but doesn't specify what that comparison should be or how to implement it. It's vague and doesn't offer actionable steps. While it does point out an issue, the lack of clarity makes it somewhat helpful but not very. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is borderline in actionability, weakly grounded, unverifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The author questions whether the output-side layers benefit from the method, whether Figure 4 is clearly illustrated, whether the details of Pixel-shuffle are clearly presented, whether Pixel-shuffle is used in super-resolution, why the dimensionality remains the same after upsampling, and whether the authors provided limitations and societal impacts. These are all opinions or judgments about the paper.  \n2. **Assess Verifiability:** The claims are not well-supported. The review does not provide any evidence or justification for these opinions. For example, the author does not reference any external works or provide logical reasoning to support these claims.  \n3. **Helpfulness:** The review is somewhat helpful as it raises several concerns, but it lacks depth and specificity. The author does not provide any suggestions or solutions, which is a limitation for the authors in improving their work.  \n\nTherefore, the scores are:  \nactionability_label: 3  \ngrounding_specificity_label: 5  \nverifiability_label: 3  \nhelpfulness_label: 3  \n\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The presentation of this paper is hard to follow for the reviewer.\" I'm supposed to assess it based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Each has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review mentions that the presentation is hard to follow, but it doesn't specify what needs to be done. So, the reviewer is pointing out a problem, but they're not giving any actionable steps. That means it's not explicit or implicit because there's no suggestion on how to improve the presentation. Therefore, it's unactionable. So, actionability label is 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This looks at whether the review refers to a specific part of the paper. The comment just says the presentation is hard to follow without pointing to a specific section or issue. So, the reviewer isn't clearly identifying which part is problematic. It's not grounded because it's too vague. Hence, grounding_specificity is 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a judgment about the presentation being hard to follow. There's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's just a statement of opinion without backing. So, it's unverifiable. Verifiability label is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does identify an issue but lacks specifics. It tells the author that the presentation is unclear but doesn't suggest what changes to make. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps. So, it's barely helpful. Therefore, helpfulness is 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the review point is unhelpful and lacks both grounding and verifiability, while it's also not actionable. It's just a general statement without any real guidance for improvement.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

However, the suggestion is somewhat vague as it doesn't specify how to present the models in more detail. The reviewer would need to infer how to improve the paper based on this comment.  \n   - **Score**: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - The reviewer mentions specific models (DMM, DVBF, KVAE) and their differences with KVAE, which clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed. Additionally, the reviewer asks about the computation requirements of the three methods, providing specific details about what needs to be addressed.  \n   - **Score**: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   - The reviewer provides a claim about the computation requirements of the three methods and supports it by stating that KVAE is simpler with linear state space transitions but requires time-dependent LGSSM parameters. This is logical reasoning and specific examples, making the claim verifiable.  \n   - **Score**: 3 (Somewhat Verifiable)\n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   - The review point is clear and provides specific suggestions for the authors to improve their paper.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions including certain works and discussing differences from others. It doesn't specify exactly what changes the authors should make. So, it's explicit in suggesting improvements but lacks concrete details on how to implement them. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific works by Li et al. and He et al. by name, which is a strong point. It clearly identifies the parts of the paper that need comparison. So, this is fully grounded because it accurately points to the sections being addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests including specific works and comparing them. It provides references, which are external sources, making the claims verifiable. The reasoning is clear, and the references are specific, so this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions to include related work and discuss differences. It's actionable and provides meaningful feedback, which helps the authors improve their draft. This makes it highly helpful.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, the review is somewhat actionable, fully grounded, fully verifiable, and highly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the first quotation mark around \"in-between\" should be a forward quote. It explicitly tells the author to change the quotation mark, which is a clear action. Then, it explains exactly how to do it by specifying the correct type of quote. That seems pretty actionable. So, I'd rate this as highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"in-between\" uncertainty and specifies that the first quote should be forward. It's not just pointing out a problem but also giving a clear solution. The author can easily pinpoint where to make the change. So, this has strong grounding because it's specific about the part of the paper and what needs fixing. I'd give this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the author is using backward quotes instead of forward ones. It's suggesting a correction but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to back this up. It's just a statement of what's wrong, not why or how it's an issue. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification given. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does tell the author what to do, but it's quite brief. It doesn't elaborate on why this change is necessary or how it affects the paper. While it's a helpful suggestion, it lacks depth. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I'd rate this a 4 because it's clear and actionable but could be improved with more explanation.\n\nOverall, the review is clear and specific about the change needed, which is great for the author, but it doesn't provide enough justification, making it less helpful in terms of verifiability.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The new proposed dataset, DRRI, could have been explored more in the paper.\" The first thing I notice is that it suggests an improvement, but it's pretty vague. It doesn't specify what exactly should be done with DRRI. So, is this explicit or implicit? It seems like it's implying that more exploration is needed but doesn't give a clear action. Therefore, it's implicit. Since it's not explicit, the authors can't directly know what to do. So, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This looks at how specific the review is about the paper. The comment mentions DRRI but doesn't specify where in the paper it should be explored. It doesn't point to a particular section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the part of the paper. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is suggesting that DRRI could be explored more, but it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is important or beneficial. There's no reference to external literature or common knowledge supporting this suggestion. So, it's not verifiable. The claim is made without support, making it 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does suggest an improvement but doesn't specify how or why it's beneficial. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very helpful because it lacks clarity and direction. Therefore, helpfulness is also 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The comment asks the authors to provide references for two specific passages and to explain \"MLP\" in Figure 2. It's pretty clear what needs to be done, so that's explicit. The instructions are direct, so the authors know exactly how to respond. There's no ambiguity here, so I think this is highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment is asking for references and an explanation of \"MLP\". It doesn't specify which part of the paper these refer to, but it's clear which sections they're pointing to. So, the authors can identify the sections without guessing. That means it's fully grounded. Also, it's specific about what needs to be addressed. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment is making claims by suggesting that the authors provide references and explain a term. However, it doesn't support these claims with any evidence or reasoning. It's just asking for more information, which isn't helpful in terms of verifiability. So, this should be marked as X because there's no justification provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment is asking for references and an explanation, which is helpful. It gives clear directions, so the authors know what to do. However, it doesn't go beyond that; it doesn't suggest alternative approaches or deeper improvements. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not the most comprehensive.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the experimental results on two datasets aren't convincing and compares them to IRM. It does suggest looking into the problems mentioned above. So, the action is clear: evaluate the experiments. But the instruction isn't explicit on how to do that. It's vague on the steps, so it's not fully actionable. That makes it **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"the last two datasets\" and mentions \"performance is similar to IRM.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or figure this is referring to. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. It's more general, so it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the results aren't convincing and that the performance is similar to IRM. It doesn't provide any justification or references for why this is the case. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a weakness in the experiments and suggests looking into the problems mentioned.

It's more of a complaint than a suggestion. The second part, \"I would have like to see some experiments,\" is an implicit action, but it's vague. It tells the authors what to do but doesn't specify how to implement it, like suggesting where to add experiments or how to design them. So, it's borderline actionable because it hints at an action but doesn't give concrete steps. Therefore, I'd rate this as 2 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions wanting \"some experiments where the bounds are validated.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or where to add these experiments. The mention is general, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly what's needed. This means the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is a statement expressing a desire for experiments. There's no claim here; it's more of a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. So, it doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Figure 6: the font size is a little bit small.\" The user is pointing out an issue with the figure's font size. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. In this case, the reviewer is telling the authors to fix the font size. But is this explicit or implicit? It seems explicit because they're directly telling them which figure to look at and what to do. \n\nNext, is the action concrete? The reviewer is saying to make the font size smaller, but they don't specify how much smaller or how to do it technically. So, it's a bit vague. But since it's explicit, maybe it's still considered actionable. I think this might be a 5 because it's clear which part to fix, even if the specifics are missing.\n\nMoving on to grounding_specificity. The review mentions Figure 6, which is specific. They don't have to guess where it is; it's clearly stated. Also, they're pointing out a specific issue with the figure's font size. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That should be a 5 here.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting a change. The reviewer is claiming that the font size needs to be adjusted. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, it's a straightforward observation. The authors can verify by checking the figure themselves. There's no external reference needed, but it's clear and logical. So, it's fully verifiable, which would be a 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a clear issue and suggesting a fix. It's direct and gives the authors something to work on. It's not too vague, so it's helpful but maybe not the most detailed. I'd rate this a 4 because it's helpful but could be more comprehensive.\n\nWait, but for actionability, I initially thought it might be a 5, but maybe it's a 4 because the action is a bit vague. Let me reconsider. The reviewer says to make the font smaller, but doesn't specify how much or the method. So, it's explicit but not entirely concrete. Maybe it's a 4 for actionability.\n\nSo, adjusting the scores: actionability 4, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 5, helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests comparing CPEF with ExpertBert to make the comparison fair. It's explicit about the action, which is to recommend a comparison. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this\u2014like which specific changes to make or where to find ExpertBert. So it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions PMEF lacks a pre-training module and recommends comparing with ExpertBert. It doesn't explicitly name the section where PMEF is discussed, but it's clear enough about the issue. So it's **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it points to the problem without needing more context.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the comparison is unfair because PMEF doesn't have a pre-training module. It suggests adding a fair comparison, which is a claim. The justification is that ExpertBert is a pre-trained model, which is a common knowledge point. So it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because it's justified but could be clearer.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review provides a clear recommendation and explains why the comparison is unfair. It gives the authors a specific direction to improve, which is helpful. It's not the most detailed but is sufficient for improvement. So it's **Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. I should make sure each score aligns with the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
