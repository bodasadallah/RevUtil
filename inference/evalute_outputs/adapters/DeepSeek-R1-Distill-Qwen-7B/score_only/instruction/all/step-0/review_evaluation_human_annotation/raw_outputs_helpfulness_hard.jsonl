Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that there's a general cognitive bias among NLP researchers mapping worse results to \"on par\" and better ones to \"better\". It suggests correcting the wording but doesn't specify what needs to be done or how to apply the correction. So, the action is explicit (correcting the wording), but the concreteness is lacking because it doesn't provide detailed steps on how to fix it. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the review points out a bias without clearly identifying which part of the paper it's referring to. It doesn't specify where the bias is present or what needs addressing, so the grounding is weak. It's **Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nMoving to **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment about the bias without providing evidence or justification. It's a claim without supporting references or logical reasoning, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a suggestion to correct the wording but doesn't elaborate on how to do that. It's vague and lacks depth, making it somewhat helpful but not fully so. It's **Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point says that for results in Table 3, part (a) compares Chinese MOS-Q with NVSB and GT Mel A, and part (b) shows overlapping 95% CI for Chinese and English MOS-V between Baseline and NVSB. It doesn't specify what the authors should do next. So, it's not giving explicit actions like suggesting a change or explaining a result. It just states the findings. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific comparisons in Table 3, part (a) and (b). It clearly identifies the sections of the paper being discussed, like the specific MOS-Q and MOS-V comparisons. It doesn't just refer to the table but specifically mentions the parts. So, this has full grounding because it accurately points to the sections being addressed. But does it specify what's wrong or missing? It just states the findings without explaining why they're important or what needs to be done. So, while it's grounded, it's not specific in terms of addressing issues. Therefore, I'd rate this as 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review claims that NVSB is comparable to GT Mel A for MOS-Q and that Baseline and NVSB have overlapping 95% CI for MOS-V in both languages. But it doesn't provide any justification or references for these claims. It just states them without supporting evidence. So, the claim is unverifiable because there's no backing to support the assertions. Hence, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out some statistical findings but doesn't offer actionable suggestions or interpretations that would help the authors improve their work. It's more of a descriptive analysis without providing clear guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Therefore, I'd rate this as 3 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is not actionable, well-grounded but not specific, unverifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using an ablation study, which is a clear action. But does it give enough detail on how to implement it? The comment doesn't specify how to conduct the ablation study or what metrics to use. It's vague on the implementation, so it's not fully actionable. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions existing papers and proposes post-processing steps but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper is being addressed. It's a bit vague about the specific issue, so it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does touch on the post-processing steps, which are specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests an ablation study but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is necessary. It's vague and lacks supporting references or logical reasoning, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a gap in the paper by suggesting an ablation study, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or evidence, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think each aspect is a 3 because they all have some elements but lack the full details needed for maximum impact.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests a method for identifying antecedents when the prediction is a pronoun. It mentions that the authors' method involves matching the head of noun phrases but isn't clear when the head word isn't a pronoun. I think this is an explicit action because it directly points out a potential issue with the method. However, it doesn't provide a specific solution or how to handle that situation. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to know what to do next. I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the authors' method by mentioning the head of noun phrases. It doesn't explicitly name a specific part of the paper, but it's clear enough that the authors can infer where the problem lies. So, the grounding is weak but present. The specificity is good because it clearly states what's wrong\u2014the method's limitation when the head isn't a pronoun. I think this should be a 5 because it's grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the authors' method isn't clear in certain cases. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement without justification, so it's unverifiable. I'll give this a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a problem with the method, which is helpful. However, it doesn't suggest any fixes or improvements. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue but doesn't guide the authors on how to resolve it. So, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It's a bit unclear how the frame similarity factors and attributes similarity factors are selected.\" The action here is pointing out that the selection process is unclear. However, it doesn't provide any specific steps or examples on how to improve this. It's more of a general statement, so it's not explicit. Since it's pointing out the issue but not giving concrete advice, it's somewhere between explicit and implicit. I think this is a 3 because it's explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"frame similarity factors\" and \"attributes similarity factors\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section it's referring to. It's unclear, so the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded since it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. So, this would be a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the selection process is unclear but doesn't provide any justification or references.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that treating concept map extraction as a separate task might be necessary. It mentions that many systems build knowledge graphs and use them for summarization, but as the number of nodes increases, concept maps become harder to distinguish. The reviewer then advises that general summaries should be more readable. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with current methods and suggesting a solution. However, the suggestion is quite vague. They don't specify what exactly should be done, like suggesting a particular method or providing an example. So, while the reviewer is making a recommendation, it's not clear how the authors should implement it. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about concept maps becoming harder to distinguish as the number of nodes increases. It mentions that general summaries should be more readable. The reviewer is referring to a specific part of the paper, which is the section discussing summarization systems and their limitations. They also imply that the issue lies in the complexity of concept maps. So, the grounding is pretty clear\u2014they're pointing to a specific part of the paper and explaining why it's an issue. The specificity comes from addressing the challenge of increasing node numbers making concept maps harder to distinguish. This seems well-grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The reviewer is making a judgment that current systems build knowledge graphs for summarization but don't handle the increasing complexity of concept maps well. They suggest that general summaries should be more readable. This is a claim because it's an opinion or judgment about the effectiveness of current methods. Now, is this claim verifiable? The reviewer doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning to back up their judgment. They just state their opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks strong justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is about suggesting that concept maps should be treated as a separate task to avoid issues with increasing node numbers. They mention that general summaries should be more readable. This provides some guidance but doesn't specify how to implement the solution. It's clear that there's an issue and a suggestion for improvement, but the helpfulness is limited because the implementation details are missing.

It's explicit about pointing out the issue and asking for more details, so that's actionable. But it's vague because it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. They still need to figure out how to expand the dataset or identify style shifts.

Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a deficiency but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. They suggest looking at references, but that's not an explicit action. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what to do. Maybe they should add tools or cite existing ones. But since it's not clear, I'd rate this as 1, which is unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is. The reviewer mentions reinforcement learning but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is missing. They just say there's no corresponding set of tools.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that Section 4 is written very tersely and could use a slower development for readability. It mentions the issue but doesn't provide specific steps on how to improve it. So, it's explicit in pointing out the problem but doesn't give actionable advice. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know there's a problem, but they don't know exactly what to do. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Section 4 without specifying which part exactly. It just says \"Section 4\" and mentions the need for slower development. Since it doesn't point out a specific element or table, it's not fully grounded. It's only somewhat grounded because it does address the section but doesn't give precise details. So, I'll give it a 3 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that Section 4 is too terse and could use more development. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to support this claim. It's just an opinion without justification. So, this is unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that Section 4 is too concise and suggests it could use more development. It's clear and provides some insight, but it doesn't specify how to improve it. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully constructive. Therefore, I'll rate it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the dataset isn't available yet, so they should take a cautious approach. Is this explicit or implicit? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a direct action. They're suggesting caution, which is more of an implication. So, it's implicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer isn't telling the authors exactly what to do; they're just saying to be cautious. So, it's not concrete. Therefore, this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's an explicit action but vague on how to apply it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions the dataset isn't available. Is this specific? They're talking about a \"promised dataset,\" which is a specific part of the paper. They also imply that it's a contribution, so they're pointing to a specific area. They're not just making a general statement. So, this is **Full Grounding** because they're accurately pinpointing the section. Then, how specific is the comment? They're saying it's not available, which is clear. So, it's **Specific**. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The comment is a claim because it's suggesting that the dataset isn't available. Is this claim supported? The reviewer is stating an observation, not making a judgment or recommendation. There's no external reference or reasoning provided. It's just a statement. So, it's not verifiable. Therefore, this should be **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't offering a solution. They're just saying the dataset isn't available and advising caution. This is helpful in that it identifies an issue, but it's not actionable or specific. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Therefore, this should be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that related work on modular networks for VQA, like [A], is crucial but doesn't specify how to apply this information. It tells the authors to mention it, which is explicit. But it doesn't give concrete steps on where or how to add that information. So, it's explicit but lacks detail. That would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but doesn't explain exactly how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"related work on modular networks for VQA\" and mentions [A]. This is a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is full. It also clearly states what's missing, which is the mention of modular architectures. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to a specific part and explains the issue there.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding related work but doesn't provide any justification or examples. It's a claim that modular networks are important but doesn't back it up. So, it's not fully verifiable. It's more of a suggestion without support, so I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some justification but lacks key elements like references or explanations.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review clearly points out a specific area for improvement by referencing existing work. It's specific and gives a clear direction for the authors. The suggestion is actionable and directly addresses their introduction. This makes it **5: Highly Helpful** because it's specific, clear, and provides a meaningful feedback point that the authors can use to enhance their work.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the ablation experiment's performance dropped when reinforcement learning wasn't used, and that the tables don't show cases without the dependency tree or RL. It seems like it's pointing out specific issues, but does it tell the authors exactly what to do? The reviewer suggests looking at the tables for more info, which is an explicit action, but it's vague on how to fix it. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what changes to make. I think this is a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the ablation experiment and the tables but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is missing. It's a bit vague, so the authors might not know exactly where to look. This isn't fully grounded because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or issue. So, I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the performance dropped without reinforcement learning and that the tables are incomplete. They aren't providing any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's a claim without justification, so it's not very verifiable. I think this is a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary support.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out specific issues in the ablation experiment and mentions the tables. However, it doesn't provide clear suggestions on how to improve the results or what changes to make. It's pointing out problems but not guiding the authors on how to fix them. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully constructive. I'd give this a 3 as well.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or specificity needed to be fully actionable, grounded, verifiable, or helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the split between static and temporal features is confusing because it lacks information about what S and Xt are. The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue but isn't suggesting an explicit action. They're just pointing out a lack of clarity. So, this isn't an explicit action; it's more of a statement of concern. Therefore, it's not actionable because the reviewer isn't telling the authors what to do. I think this falls under \"Unactionable\" which is label 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions S and Xt but doesn't specify what they are. They're pointing out a lack of clarity but aren't pinning down exactly where the confusion is. So, the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the part of the paper being addressed. However, they do provide some specificity by talking about the split between static and temporal features. So, it's weakly grounded but specific. That would be label 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that more information is needed. They're not providing any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's just a statement of opinion without justification. So, this is unverifiable, which is label 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue but isn't providing clear suggestions or actionable steps. They're leaving the authors to figure out what they need to do based on their current understanding. This is somewhat helpful but not very detailed or constructive. So, it's somewhat helpful, which is label 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper deals with many graph notions and that the writing is generally good but could use more details. It also suggests providing definitions for resistance distance and more explanations for Algorithm 1. The action here is clear: the authors need to add more details and clarify Algorithm 1. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. However, the action is a bit vague because it doesn't specify how to add these details or where exactly in the paper they should go. So, it's not fully actionable but still gives a direction. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable,\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the writing being generally good but could use more details. It doesn't specify which part of the paper needs improvement, like sections, figures, or unique aspects. It's a bit vague in pointing out where the issues are. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper. The specificity is also lacking because it doesn't detail what needs to be added. Therefore, this is \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" but wait, no, since it's not pinpointing anything, it's more like \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific,\" which is a 2. Hmm, but the scale says 1 is not grounded, 2 is weakly grounded and not specific, 3 is weakly grounded and specific, 4 is fully grounded and under-specific, and 5 is fully grounded and specific. Since it doesn't mention any specific part, it's definitely weakly grounded. So, 2.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that the writing is generally good but could use more details. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest specific areas for improvement, like adding definitions and clarifying Algorithm 1. It's clear and actionable, even though it's a bit vague. The authors will find this helpful because they know what needs to be done. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful,\" which is a 3.\n\nWait, but for grounding_specificity, I initially thought it was 2, but maybe it's 3 because it does mention the writing is generally good, which could imply specific areas. Hmm, but the review doesn't specify which part exactly. So, I think 2 is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 2, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests introducing specific aspects of the model, like mentioning that we're not dealing with infinite subdivisions for certain parameters. It also provides examples, like acceleration and scaling parameters being bounded. This seems like a clear action because it tells the authors exactly what to do. The examples make it concrete, so I think this is highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parameters and their bounds, which clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed. It's not just a general statement but points to exact sections or elements. Also, it explains what needs to be addressed, which adds specificity. So, this should be fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides clear reasoning by explaining the bounds on parameters and why this is important. It doesn't just state a claim; it logically supports it with examples. This makes it verifiable, so I'll rate it a 4 because it's mostly verifiable but could be a bit clearer.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is very helpful because it directly points out specific areas for improvement and provides clear examples. It guides the authors on what changes are necessary without being vague.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the improvement in the proposed solution on OfficeHome is marginal. It suggests that the u^l in Eq.3 tends to be 1 if Eq.4 stands. This gives a clear action for the authors to check their Eq.3 and Eq.4. It also provides specific metrics, which makes it concrete. So, this seems actionable and specific, so I'd rate it as 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific datasets like OfficeHome and specific models like CSAC and the proposed solution. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being discussed, which is the improvement in Table 5. The mention of specific metrics adds clarity, so this is fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides exact numbers from the experiments. It references specific results, which are verifiable through the experiments. The reasoning is clear and based on the data, so this is fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is specific about the marginal improvement and suggests a check in the equations. It's clear and provides actionable feedback without being too vague. This makes it quite helpful, so I'll rate it as 4.\n\nI think each aspect is evaluated based on the criteria provided, and the review seems to cover all necessary points effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that using volumetric representation isn't novel and mentions VolumeDeform [1]. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next or how to apply this information. So, it's not giving them actionable steps. That means it's not actionable at all, so I'd rate it as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to VolumeDeform by citation but doesn't specify exactly where or how it applies. It's a bit vague about the part of the paper it's addressing. So, the grounding isn't fully there, but it's not completely weak either. I think a 3 makes sense here because it partially identifies the referenced work but doesn't clearly pinpoint the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions a specific citation but doesn't provide any explanation or reasoning why VolumeDeform's approach is relevant or how it applies to the task. There's no justification or examples given, so it's not very verifiable. I'd rate this a 3 as well because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks key elements.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a lack of novelty but doesn't offer any concrete suggestions or improvements for the authors. It's more of a criticism without actionable advice. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'll give it a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review provides clear, specific, and useful feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point says, \"It is also quite common in cases like that to average over the subword representations, which is done e.g. by [Hewitt and Manning (2019, footnote 4)](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1419.pdf).\" It mentions that averaging is common but doesn't provide any specific action or suggestion. It just states a fact and references a source. So, it's not giving the authors any actionable steps. Therefore, it's not fully actionable. Maybe it's somewhat actionable because it does suggest that averaging is a practice, but without any guidance on what to do next. So, I think it's a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points to a specific reference, [Hewitt and Manning (2019, footnote 4)], which is a specific source. It also mentions \"cases like that,\" which might be a bit vague, but the reference is explicit. So, it's fully grounded because it references a specific part of the literature. The specificity is good because it's clear which work is being referenced. So, I'd give it a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a specific reference to a paper and a footnote. This is a strong form of justification because it cites an external source to support the claim that averaging is common. The reasoning is clear and well-supported by existing literature. So, this should be fully verifiable, which is a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review mentions that averaging is common and references a source, but it doesn't suggest any alternative approach or why averaging might be an issue. It's pointing out a practice without offering improvement. While it's somewhat helpful in identifying a potential area for discussion, it lacks concrete suggestions. So, it's mostly helpful but not the most comprehensive. Therefore, a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 5, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the model AUC assesses discriminant ability but points out that consistency between predicted scores and actual risk is harder to show. It suggests conducting calibration curves and proving the feasibility of the scoring system. It also mentions discussing the differences between traditional and their method. \n\nI think this is pretty actionable. The reviewer is giving clear steps: conduct calibration curves, prove feasibility, and discuss differences. The author can directly follow these steps. So, I'd rate this as 5 for actionability because it's explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about model discriminant ability, calibration curves, and compares methods. They don't explicitly mention specific sections of the paper, like a particular table or figure, but they do refer to the model's performance and the clinical scoring system. It's a bit vague, but they do imply which parts to focus on. So, I'd say this is grounded but not fully specific. Maybe a 4? Wait, no, the definitions say fully grounded is when they can pinpoint the section. Here, they don't name a section, so maybe it's weakly grounded. But they do refer to the model and system, which is more specific than just saying \"the paper.\" Hmm, maybe 4 because it's grounded but not fully specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer makes a claim that consistency is crucial for the clinical system and suggests conducting calibration curves. They also mention discussing method differences. The justification is that it's important for clinical use, which is a good point, but they don't provide specific references or examples. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth. So, I'd rate this as 3 because it's verifiable but not fully supported with evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer provides several concrete suggestions: calibration curves, feasibility proof, and method comparison. These are clear and actionable, so the authors will find this helpful. It's not the most detailed, but it's sufficient. So, I'd rate this as 4 because it's mostly helpful with some room for improvement.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For grounding_specificity, I thought it might be 4, but maybe it's 3 because they don't pin down a specific part. And for verifiability, it's 3 because it's somewhat justified but lacks specific references. Actionability is definitely 5, and helpfulness is 4. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Therefore, it is **Somewhat Actionable** (3).  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   The review points out specific areas for improvement, such as baselines missing certain settings and societal impacts.

It also asks if this is unique to sparsity detection or true for GNNs in general, referencing Section 4.3. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do, like suggesting improvements or changes. It's more of a question, which is an implicit action, but it's vague. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 2 because it's borderline.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Section 4.3 but doesn't specify exactly what part of the paper or what issue is being addressed. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact section or issue. Maybe a 3 since it's weakly grounded but somewhat specific in asking about Section 4.3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting that sparsity patterns are almost equal, which is a judgment. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's vague and lacks support. So, it's unverifiable, maybe a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question and making a suggestion, but it's vague. It doesn't provide concrete feedback or detailed suggestions.

It doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done, like adding a comparison or what part of the analysis to include. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for an action but doesn't give clear instructions on how to do it. That sounds like it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does mention an action but doesn't detail it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment says to compare Section 6 to prior efforts but doesn't specify which part of Section 6 or what aspects of the comparison. It's pretty general, so the authors might not know exactly where to focus their improvements. This seems like **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it partially identifies the area but isn't very clear on the specifics.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It's just recommending a comparison without backing it up with why that's necessary or pointing to existing literature. So, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does suggest a useful improvement by pointing out a gap in the related work.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests looking at performance with different numbers of scenarios, but it doesn't specify what changes to make. It's more of a suggestion without concrete steps. So, it's not explicit because it's not telling the authors exactly what to do. It's also not concrete because it doesn't provide details on how to adjust the number of scenarios. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it implies an action but doesn't give specifics. So, I'd rate it as 1 for unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the number of scenarios but doesn't tie it directly to the paper's sections or specific parts. It's a general statement, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly where to focus. That means it's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. So, I'd give it a 3, which is weak grounding with some specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that performance is related to the number of scenarios. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing to validate the claim. Therefore, the verifiability label is 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest examining performance with different numbers of scenarios, which is helpful.

It clearly points out where the authors should look for extensions, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is high because it mentions particular works, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that these papers provide better theory for SGD in nonconvex settings. However, it doesn't support this claim with any reasoning or references. It just states it, so it's not verifiable. I'll rate this a 1 because it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest some relevant literature, which is helpful. It's clear and provides direction, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed.

This means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper being addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that there are issues but doesn't provide any evidence or justification. It's just a general claim without supporting references or logical reasoning. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing to make the claim credible.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out problems but doesn't offer specific suggestions or guidance on how to fix them.

It also mentions citing some papers. I think this is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do\u2014run more experiments and reference certain works. It doesn't just suggest; it gives clear steps. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific network structures and cites external works. It's not just vague; it points to exact parts of the paper. The grounding is strong because it clearly references sections or unique aspects. The specificity is also good because it explains what needs to be done with those experiments. So, this should be fully grounded and specific, scoring a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment includes references to specific papers. While the reasoning is clear\u2014suggesting experiments and citing works\u2014it's based on external knowledge. It's verifiable because others can check those references. It's not just a opinion but backed by evidence. So, this should be fully verifiable, getting a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions and references. It's not just pointing out a problem but actively guiding the authors on what to do next. The references are specific, which adds value. This is highly helpful because it empowers the authors to improve their work. So, a 5 here as well.\n\nI don't see any issues with these scores.

However, it doesn't provide explicit guidance on how to implement this. The suggestion is vague, leaving the authors uncertain about the exact steps to take. Therefore, it's borderline actionable.  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label (5):**  \n   The review explicitly mentions Eq.(1) and Algorithm 1, clearly identifying the specific part of the paper. Additionally, it provides specific details about the reformulation, making it highly grounded and specific.  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label (3):**  \n   The claim is that reformulating the prox-linear subproblem using the conjugate function makes the motivation of Algorithm 1 unclear. While the reasoning is logical, there's no external reference or specific example provided to support this claim. The justification is somewhat sufficient but lacks depth.  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label (3):**  \n   The review provides a clear claim about the potential reformulation but lacks specific examples or references to back it up.

It suggests that the features and their positions vary across categories but doesn't provide explicit instructions on what needs to be done. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors can't directly identify the modifications required. This falls under \"Unactionable\" as per the scale.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**: The comment refers to \"different categories\" but doesn't explicitly point to a specific part of the paper or provide details on what needs to be addressed. It lacks specific information about the features or their positions, so it's not grounded. This is \"Not Grounded\" as per the scale.\n\n3. **Verifiability Label**: The review point doesn't contain a claim or suggestion; it's more of a general observation without supporting evidence or justification. There's no claim to verify, so it's \"Unverifiable.\"\n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**: The comment provides some insight into the structure of the features but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or improvements.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the results in Table 6 don't align with Table 1 regarding MCT-pair and mentions ablation studies of MCT without adaptive metrics. It's clear that the author needs to explain why there's a discrepancy, but it doesn't specify how to address it. So, it's an explicit action but lacks detail on how to fix the issue. That makes it **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to specific tables but doesn't clearly identify which parts of the tables are problematic. It's a bit vague, so the grounding isn't fully solid. It's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it mentions the tables but doesn't pin down the exact issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states the issues without supporting evidence. So, it's **X: No Claim** because there's no claim or justification given.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out specific areas the author should look into, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that similar analyses exist in prior works and cites specific papers. It doesn't provide any specific actions or suggestions for the authors to take. So, there's no explicit or implicit guidance on what changes to make. That means it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to prior works and specific citations, so it does ground the discussion in existing literature. However, it doesn't specify exactly what part of the paper needs improvement or what the issue is. It's a bit vague in pinpointing the exact area. So, I think this is weakly grounded but not fully. Maybe a 3 on the grounding_specificity scale.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review does cite specific papers and provides references, which helps in verifying the claims. However, the discussion is quite general and doesn't go into much detail about why these prior works are relevant or how they apply to the current context. There's some justification but not enough depth. So, I'd rate this as 3 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out that prior work exists and provides some context, which is helpful. However, it's quite generic and doesn't offer specific actionable advice to the authors. It lacks the depth needed to truly assist them in improving their draft.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the 10 sub-tasks are simplistic and could be solved with the final model. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next, like suggesting specific changes or improvements. So, it's not giving clear actions. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think a 3 here because it's not fully actionable but has some guidance.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper it's talking about. It just says the sub-tasks are simplistic. Without pointing to a specific section or issue, the authors can't know where to focus their improvements. So, it's not grounded at all. Maybe a 1 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the sub-tasks are simplistic and could be solved with the final model. But it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's unverifiable. I'd give it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out that the sub-tasks are too simple and suggests the final model could handle them. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue, but it's vague and doesn't offer specific suggestions. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

It also mentions missing related work but doesn't provide specific suggestions on how to address this. So, it's giving an implicit action but not being explicit or concrete. That would make it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out a specific term but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague, so it's **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions missing related work but doesn't provide any justification or references.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"I don't think the study about different subdomain sizes is an 'ablation' study since they aren't removing a component of the method.\" The reviewer is pointing out that the study isn't an ablation study because they didn't remove any components. This is an explicit action because the reviewer is directly stating what the study isn't. It doesn't require the authors to infer anything; it's clear. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because the reviewer is specifying that the study isn't an ablation study and explaining why. So, this should be a 3 because it's explicit but lacks some detail on how to apply this information.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"the study about different subdomain sizes\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. They also don't provide any examples or references. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly what part is being discussed. The specificity is also low since there's no detailed explanation of why it's not an ablation study. Therefore, this should be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the study isn't an ablation study. However, there's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's just a statement without justification. So, this is unverifiable, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue but in a somewhat vague way.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that all linear convergence rates rely on Theorem 8, which is in the appendix and the proof isn't clear. The comment is pointing out an issue, but it's not giving a direct action for the authors to take. They know there's a problem, but it's not clear what to do next. So, this is more of an implicit suggestion rather than an explicit action. Since it's not giving a clear direction, it's probably not actionable. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Theorem 8 in the appendix but doesn't specify exactly where or how to address the issue. It's a bit vague about pinpointing the exact part of the paper that needs improvement. So, the grounding isn't very strong because it's not clearly identifying the section or the specific issue. Therefore, I'd give this a 3, which is weak grounding but somewhat specific in pointing out the theorem.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that the proof isn't clear enough, which is a claim. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for why the proof isn't clear. There's no reference to external literature or logical reasoning to back this up. So, it's not very verifiable. I'd rate this as 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out an issue but doesn't offer a solution or specific advice on how to improve Theorem 8 or the proof. It's more of a criticism without actionable steps. While it's helpful in identifying a problem, it lacks the constructive suggestions needed for improvement. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully so.

It gives a direct comment about the comparison but doesn't specify how to improve it. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on the exact changes needed. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment points out specific issues with BRP-NAS but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's vague about the alternatives mentioned, so the grounding is weak. It's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the alternatives but doesn't pin down the exact section.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that BRP-NAS only compares against three alternatives and ignores others. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references for this claim. It's clear that the claim is made, but there's no supporting evidence, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a critique but doesn't suggest specific improvements. It points out a limitation but doesn't guide the authors on how to address it. This makes it somewhat helpful but not fully constructive, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated as 3 because they either provide some information but lack the depth or specificity needed for full effectiveness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the method works for digit or text images but not for natural images like CIFAR10. It's asking if the method can be extended. The comment is explicit about the limitation and suggests an action, which is to check if the method can be applied elsewhere. However, it doesn't provide specific steps on how to do that, so it's not very detailed.

It also points out natural images like CIFAR10, which is another specific part. The grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections being discussed. Additionally, it explains why the method might not work for natural images, which adds specificity. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the method doesn't work for natural images. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just a statement without justification, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify a limitation and suggests an improvement area, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests adding a note about existing work or stating it's an open problem. It says, \"maybe a line or two should be added that there exists no solution for this, and it is an open (hard) problem.\" That gives the authors a clear action: add a couple of lines. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It tells them exactly where to add the information and what to write. So I think this is highly actionable. So I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions \"existing work\" but doesn't specify which work. It's a bit vague. They could have pointed to a specific section or result in the paper, but they just say it's an open problem. So the grounding is weak because it's not precise. But it does address the issue, so maybe it's not fully grounded. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests looking for existing work but doesn't provide any references or examples. It's a claim that there's an approximation, but without evidence, it's hard to verify. So it's somewhat verifiable because it's a claim, but lacks supporting details. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is clear and suggests specific actions, which is helpful. It doesn't seem vague or unhelpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the work uses only binary features and suggests that real-world data often has more types of features. It implies that the method might not apply to real and categorical features. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a limitation but isn't giving a specific action for the authors to take. They're just stating that the method might not apply elsewhere. So, it's not giving a clear instruction on what to do next. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know there's a limitation, but they don't get a direct fix. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the comment is. The reviewer mentions real-world data and different feature types but doesn't pin down exactly which part of the paper they're referring to. They're making a general comment without clearly identifying the section or figure. So, the grounding isn't strong because they're not pointing to a specific part. But they are specific in their suggestion about the method's applicability. So, I'd rate this a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that real-world data isn't binary and that the method might not apply. They're suggesting an improvement, which is a claim. Now, they're providing some reasoning by stating that real-world data is usually a mix, but it's vague. They don't cite any external references or give a clear justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's some reasoning, but it's not robust. Hence, a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out a limitation and suggesting the method might not apply elsewhere. It's clear and provides some actionable feedback. However, it's not giving a lot of specific advice on how to adjust the method. It's helpful but could be more detailed. So, a 3 makes sense here as well.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or specificity that would push it to a higher score.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the algorithm for constructing coresets isn't novel because existing frameworks for classical k-means and (k,z) clusterings are extended to the kernelized setting. It doesn't provide specific actions or modifications the authors should make. So, it's not explicit or concrete. Therefore, it's unactionable, which would be a score of 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions existing frameworks but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing or what exactly needs to be changed. It's vague, so it's not grounded. That's also a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the algorithm isn't novel because of extensions of existing frameworks. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references to support this claim. It's just a statement without evidence, so it's unverifiable. Another 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a lack of novelty but doesn't offer any actionable suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much. So, it's not helpful at all, scoring a 1.\n\nOverall, the review point doesn't provide much value to the authors in terms of actionable feedback, grounding, verifiability, or helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Why do you only consider ECG segments with one label assigned to them? I would expect that the associated reports would be significantly easier than including all reports.\" The reviewer is pointing out a methodological choice. They're suggesting that the current approach is restrictive and that a more inclusive method would be better. \n\nNow, is this actionable? The reviewer is asking a question and making a suggestion. They're not giving explicit instructions on what to do next, like adding something or modifying a part. So, it's more of an implicit suggestion. That would fall under implicit actionability, which is considered less helpful than explicit. Also, the suggestion is vague because it doesn't specify how to make the reports easier or what changes to make. So, it's not very concrete. \n\nLooking at the scale, 1 is unactionable, 2 is borderline, 3 is somewhat actionable because it's explicit but vague. So, I think 3 makes sense here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer is talking about ECG segments with one label. They're referring to a specific part of the paper, so that's good. They mention \"associated reports\" but don't specify which part exactly. They're implying that including all reports would be better, but they don't clearly state what needs to be addressed. So, the grounding is weak because they could have been more precise about which part they're referring to. \n\nOn the scale, 1 is not grounded, 2 is weakly grounded and not specific, 3 is weakly grounded and specific. Since they did identify a specific part (the ECG segments) but didn't clearly specify what's wrong, I think 3 is appropriate.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the current method is restrictive and that a more inclusive approach would be better. They're suggesting a change but aren't providing any evidence or justification for why the current method is bad or why the alternative is better. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. \n\nThe scale goes from 1 to 5, with X indicating no claim. Since the reviewer is making a claim but without support, it's X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a methodological choice and suggesting a different approach. They're asking a question and making a suggestion, but it's quite vague. The authors might not know exactly what to do next. It's helpful in that it points out an area for improvement but lacks depth and clarity. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most helpful.\n\nOn the scale, 1 is not helpful, 2 is barely helpful, 3 is somewhat helpful. This fits because it does suggest an improvement but doesn't specify how.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: X\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors are concerned about generating instances with more variables, but it doesn't specify what changes they should make. It's more of a statement of concern rather than a clear action. So, it's not explicit, which would make it implicit. Since it's not giving a direct action, it's probably not actionable. Maybe a 2 or 3? I think 3 because it's somewhat explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the authors' concerns but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper or clearly state what needs to be addressed. It's too general, so it's not grounded. It might be a 2 or 3. I think 3 because it's not fully grounded but there's a slight attempt.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim about the authors' concerns but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning. It's just a statement of concern without justification. So, it's unverifiable, maybe a 1 or 2. I'll go with 2 because it's a claim but lacks support.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises a concern but doesn't offer any suggestions or solutions. It's more of a critique than helpful feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. Maybe a 3 or 4. I think 3 because it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth.\n\nWait, but the helpfulness could be better if it suggested improvements. Since it doesn't, it's only somewhat helpful. So, 3 makes sense.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat lacking in terms of being fully actionable, grounded, verifiable, or helpful. So, assigning a 3 to each seems fair.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking a question about how the base node affects the model. It's explicit in asking for an explanation, so that's a clear action. However, it's a yes/no question without providing any specific steps or details on how to improve the model. So, it's not vague but lacks concrete instructions. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it's clear but not detailed enough.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review point refers to the base node and its effects on key nodes and model performance. It mentions specific parts of the model, so it's grounded. But the question is quite general, just asking if the base node affects ordering, attention, and performance. It doesn't specify exactly what needs to be changed or how, so it's not fully specific. I'd rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it does identify the part but doesn't go into detail about what's wrong or how to fix it.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review point is a claim that the base node affects the model. However, it's presented as a question, not a statement, so there's no supporting evidence or justification. It's just a question without any backing, making it unverifiable. So, this would be labeled as \"X\" with no claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question about the base node's effects. While it's relevant, it doesn't provide any actionable steps or specific advice on how to improve the model. It's more of a probing question without clear guidance, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it does touch on an important point but lacks depth in addressing how to fix it.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, justification, and action provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review asks a question about the direction of an arrow in a figure. It's explicit because it directly points out a specific part of the paper (Figure 2) and what's wrong with it. However, it doesn't tell the author how to fix it. So, it's not fully actionable because the author still needs to figure out the correction themselves. That makes it a **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 2 by name, which is specific. It also mentions the arrow's direction and the latent space, which are clear parts of the paper. The comment is asking for clarification, which is specific to that figure. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it accurately identifies the part without needing more context.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a question seeking clarification, which doesn't present a claim. It's just asking for more information, so there's no supporting evidence. That means it's a **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and specific about an issue, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide a solution, so the authors still need to figure out the fix themselves. It's somewhat helpful but not fully, so a **3: Somewhat Helpful** makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 2, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that many abbreviations lack definition and provides an example by explaining what 'AR' stands for. The comment is explicit about the issue and gives a clear action, which is to define the abbreviations. It doesn't just state the problem; it also explains how to fix it. So, this is explicit and concrete. I think this should be a higher score, maybe 4 or 5. But since it's giving a direct action and concrete details, I'll go with 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out that 'AR' stands for domain adaptation tasks and algorithms. It's not just a vague statement; it specifically mentions the sections where these abbreviations are used. The comment is clear about which part of the paper it's addressing, so this is fully grounded. It also explains what needs to be addressed, which is the definition of the abbreviations. So, this should be a higher score. I think 4 or 5. Since it's fully grounded and specific, I'll give it a 4.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a clear explanation of what 'AR' stands for. It's logical and specific, so it's well-supported. There's no need for external references here because it's a straightforward explanation. This should be a high score. I'll rate it a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a clear issue and provides a specific solution. It's helpful because it guides the authors on what to do without being too vague. It's not just pointing out a problem but also how to fix it, which is very helpful. I think this deserves a high score, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nWait, but the initial output had helpfulness as 4. Maybe I should reconsider. The review is helpful but perhaps could be more detailed. However, it's already quite helpful by explaining the abbreviations. Maybe 4 is fair.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 4, grounding_specificity 4, verifiability 4, helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that VINS sets different sample weights, while other baselines set all weights to 1. This seems like a clear action, telling the authors to consider their approach. It's explicit because it directly points out a difference in their method. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it specifies that other methods use uniform weights, which gives the authors a clear direction on what to adjust. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"other compared baselines\" without pinning down exactly which ones. It doesn't mention specific sections or unique aspects of the paper. So, while it's pointing out a difference, it's not fully grounded because the authors can't pinpoint exactly which part needs adjustment. It's more of a general statement.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that VINS uses different weights, but it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an observation without backing it up. So, it's not very verifiable. It lacks the supporting evidence needed to be considered fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest a modification the authors should make, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague\u2014just pointing out a difference without explaining why it's better or how to implement it. This makes it somewhat helpful but not the most detailed or constructive feedback.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is highly actionable and somewhat helpful but lacks full grounding and verifiability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The time complexity will be too high if the reply buffer is too large.\" It mentions an issue but doesn't specify what needs to be done. So, the authors aren't told how to fix it. That makes it an implicit action, which is unactionable. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It just says \"the reply buffer is too large\" without mentioning any section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint where the problem is. Hence, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that time complexity is high if the buffer is too large. But there's no justification or references provided. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable, giving it a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment identifies an issue but doesn't provide any actionable steps or explanations. It's vague and lacks depth, so it's not very helpful. Therefore, helpfulness is also 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"A brief conclusion of the article and a summary of this paper's contributions need to be provided.\" I'm trying to see if this is explicit or implicit. It seems like the reviewer is telling the authors exactly what they should do\u2014they should write a conclusion and a summary. That sounds explicit because it's not asking the authors to infer what to do. Now, is it concrete? Well, it doesn't specify how to write the conclusion or the summary. It just says \"need to be provided.\" So, the action is clear, but the details on how to implement it are missing. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know what to do, but they don't know exactly how. So, I think this should be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment is about providing a conclusion and summary. It doesn't mention any specific part of the paper, like a particular section or figure. It's a general suggestion. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where to make changes. It's not fully grounded since it doesn't reference any specific part. But it's also not specific about what needs to be done. So, this should be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The comment is a suggestion to provide a conclusion and summary. There's no claim here, just a descriptive statement. It doesn't offer any justification or evidence for why this is necessary. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting reasoning or references. Therefore, this should be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment tells the authors what to do but doesn't provide any additional context or reasoning why this is important. It's a straightforward instruction without much depth. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not the most helpful because it lacks depth or context. Hence, a 3 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors should compare their framework with another method that defends against multiple attacks. This is an explicit action, so it's clear what they need to do. However, the review doesn't specify how to implement this comparison, like suggesting a particular metric or framework. So, it's explicit but lacks detail. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions comparing with a method that defends against multiple attacks. It doesn't explicitly name any specific method, so the grounding is weak. But it does imply the need to compare with another defense mechanism, which is specific enough. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that adding this comparison would make the results more meaningful. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's only a vague claim. That makes it **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting an additional comparison, which is helpful. It doesn't seem vague or unhelpful, so it's a **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and I don't see any borderline cases here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the plan-based method requires manual design, which is unrealistic. It also says that learned methods aren't comparable to pre-defined ones. I think the comment is pointing out issues but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. It's more of a critique than a suggestion. So, it's not explicit or direct. Maybe it's implicit because it's making a statement about the methods, but the authors still don't know how to fix it. So, I'd say it's borderline actionable because it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the plan-based method needing pre-defined plans and the limitations of learned methods. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to, like a particular section or table. It's making a general statement, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. Therefore, it's weakly grounded because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that manual design is unrealistic and that learned methods aren't comparable. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back these claims. So, it's just making opinions without justification, which means it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out some valid concerns but doesn't offer concrete solutions. It's pointing out limitations without providing clear guidance on how to address them. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very detailed or actionable.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is only partially addressed, so they all get a 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"I suggest to add a first sentence to introduce what this section is about.\" It explicitly tells the authors to add a sentence, which is a clear action. But it doesn't specify how to add it or where exactly. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out the implementation. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I think a 3 is appropriate.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions adding a sentence but doesn't specify which section or what to write. It's vague about the part of the paper, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly where to add the sentence. Therefore, it's not fully grounded, which would require pointing out the specific section. So, a 3 here as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion without any justification or evidence. It doesn't provide any reasoning why adding a sentence is necessary or helpful. So, it's not verifiable because there's no support given. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest a specific change, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide much guidance on how to implement the change. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful because it lacks depth. Therefore, a 3 seems right.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"What is meant by the initial rationale selector is perfect? It seems if it were perfect no additional work needs to be done.\" The author is pointing out that the rationale selector is perfect, implying that no extra work is needed. This is an explicit statement, so it's clear what the reviewer is suggesting. However, the reviewer doesn't specify how to improve the rationale selector if it's not perfect. It's vague because it doesn't provide actionable steps. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement the change.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the \"initial rationale selector\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section it's referring to. The reviewer is talking about it in a general sense, not pointing to a specific figure, table, or unique aspect of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. The specificity is also low because it's not explaining what's wrong with the rationale selector. Therefore, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**. Wait, no, actually, since it's not clearly identifying the part, it's weakly grounded. But since it's not providing specific details about what's wrong, it's also not specific. So, maybe it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**. Hmm, but looking back, the scale says if it's weak grounding and not specific, it's label 2. But the review doesn't clearly identify the part, so maybe it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not specific about the issue. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to go with **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not specific about the problem, but it's also not clearly pointing to a specific part.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review is making a judgment that the rationale selector is perfect, which is a claim. However, there's no justification or evidence provided to support this claim. The reviewer is stating an opinion without backing it up, so it's not verifiable. Therefore, this should be **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential improvement but doesn't specify how to achieve it. It's a valid point, but since it's vague, the authors might not find it very helpful. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an area for improvement, but it lacks the necessary details. So, this would be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nWait, but the initial thought for grounding_specificity was a bit conflicting. Let me double-check. The review mentions \"initial rationale selector\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. So, the grounding is weak because it's not accurately pinpointing the section. As for specificity, the reviewer is talking about the rationale selector in general, not detailing what's wrong with it. So, it's not specific. Therefore, it should be **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**. But earlier I thought it was **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**, which was incorrect. So, correcting that, it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nWait, no, the scale says:\n\n- **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**: The author cannot confidently determine which part the comment addresses, and the comment does not specify what needs to be addressed in this part.\n\nBut in this case, the author does mention \"initial rationale selector,\" which is a specific part, but doesn't specify what's wrong. So, it's weakly grounded because it's not clearly identifying the part, but it's not specific because it doesn't detail the issue. So, it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nBut wait, the initial thought was **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**, but upon reevaluation, it's actually **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because it's not providing specific details about the issue. So, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n\nBut the initial output provided was:\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests updating the definition of uncertainty to clarify that it's about epistemic model uncertainty in the prior distribution, which updates to the posterior after data. This is explicit, so the authors know exactly what to change. The explanation is also concrete, showing how the prior and posterior relate. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific parts of the paper, like the prior and posterior distributions, and explains their roles. It's clear and directly points to these sections, so it's fully grounded and specific. No part of the paper is ambiguous, so this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claim is that the current definition is unclear and needs clarification. The comment provides a logical explanation, breaking down how prior and posterior distributions relate to uncertainty. It references common knowledge about Bayesian models, making it verifiable. So, this is fully verifiable, scoring a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear, provides actionable steps, and explains the reasoning well. It guides the authors effectively without being vague. This makes it highly helpful, so a 5.\n\nI think each aspect is maximized here, so all scores should be 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

It suggests that the authors should consider using domain ontologies but doesn't specify how or where to implement this. It also asks about the number of questions and accuracy, which is somewhat vague.  \n2: **Grounding Specificity Label**: The review points to a specific part of the paper (Line 211) and asks about the system's accuracy, which is specific. However, it doesn't clearly explain what is wrong or needs improvement, so it's weakly grounded.  \n3: **Verifiability Label**: The review doesn't contain a claim; it's a factual question without supporting evidence or justification.  \n4: **Helpfulness Label**: The review is somewhat helpful as it raises a relevant concern but lacks clarity and depth in its suggestions.  \n\nANSWER: {\"actionability_label\": \"2\", \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\", \"verifiability_label\": \"X\", \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"}\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors should compare their model with chain-of-thought prompting. That's a clear action. It tells them exactly what to do, so it's explicit. Also, the action is concrete because it specifies the exact comparison to make. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions comparing with naive baselines but suggests adding chain-of-thought. It doesn't explicitly say which part of the paper it's referring to, but since it's about model comparisons, it's pretty clear. The suggestion is specific about what needs to be added. So, I think this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the suggestion is to compare with a specific approach. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning, but it's clear and logical. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it has some justification but lacks external evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a limitation and suggests a specific improvement. It's clear and actionable, so it's quite helpful. It doesn't seem vague or minimal, so it's more than just helpful. I'd rate this as mostly helpful because it could be expanded a bit more, but it's definitely useful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect seems to be at a high level, except maybe verifiability which is somewhat verifiable. But overall, they're all good.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that important experimental details are missing and that the Appendix lacks explanations. It suggests moving PCA details to the main text. Now, is this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors where to move the details. Is it concrete? It specifies where to place them, so authors know exactly what to do. So, this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific sections (Figures 3,7,8) and mentions the Appendix. This is explicit, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issues are. It's also specific about what needs fixing. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that details are missing and suggesting a solution. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the statement. So, it's somewhat justified but lacks depth. Maybe a **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issues and suggests a solution, which is helpful. It's not vague, so it's more than just helpful. It's somewhat detailed but could be expanded. So, a **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nWait, but for grounding_specificity, the review mentions specific figures and the Appendix, which is quite specific. So maybe it's 5. Similarly, actionability is explicit and concrete, so 5. Verifiability is somewhat justified but not fully, so 4. Helpfulness is clear and actionable, so 4.\n\nI think that's the evaluation.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the notation K is used for two different things. It mentions specific lines, which makes it explicit. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to fix it. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to decide whether to redefine K or adjust the text. That seems like a 3 because it's explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment references specific lines, so it's grounded. It also clearly explains the issue, which adds specificity. So, this should be a 3 because it's grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is pointing out a problem without any justification or references. It just states that K is used incorrectly. There's no explanation of why this is a problem or how it affects the paper. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment identifies an issue but doesn't suggest a fix. It just points out the abuse of notation. Without guidance on how to correct it, the authors aren't helped much. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very, which is a 3.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is explicit but lacks detailed guidance, grounding and specificity, no justification, and partial helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says it's unclear whether connecting the study to human cognition makes sense. The authors already mention that their problem is reductionist and don't allow for certain human mechanisms. The reviewer then suggests that the interaction between cognitively basic adaptation mechanisms and the CPR structure might have a bigger effect than previously thought. They also advise citing other behavioral economists for comparison. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a possible connection but isn't giving a clear step the authors should take. They mention needing more citations but don't specify which ones or how to find them. So, it's a bit vague. I think this is **Somewhat Actionable (3)** because it suggests a direction but doesn't tell exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about the authors' own statement that the problem is reductionist, which should help the authors identify where to connect. They also mention needing citations, which is a specific request. So, the reviewer is clearly pointing to specific parts of the paper, making this **Fully Grounded and Specific (5)**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that connecting to human cognition is important and suggests citing other studies. They're providing logical reasoning by pointing out the authors' own statement and advising citations. This seems well-supported, so it's **Fully Verifiable (5)**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is giving a clear suggestion to connect the study to human cognition and advises citing other work. This is helpful because it guides the authors in improving their work. It's specific enough and provides actionable advice, so it's **Somewhat Helpful (3)**.\n\nI think that's a solid evaluation based on the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the wording is overly exaggerated in the conclusion and points out that word choice is a bit flamboyant elsewhere. It doesn't specify what needs to be changed or how to fix it. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issues but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know there's a problem, but they don't know exactly what to do. I think this should be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the conclusion and mentions word choice in multiple places. It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper it's referring to, like a specific section or figure. It's a bit vague about where the issues are. So, it's not fully grounded because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the problems are. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the wording is overly exaggerated and flamboyant. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to support these claims. It's just opinions without evidence. So, it's not fully verifiable because there's no backing to back up the suggestions. I think a 3 here makes sense.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out issues in the conclusion and mentions word choice elsewhere. It gives some feedback but doesn't specify how to improve it. The suggestions are clear but lack direction on how to fix the problems. So, it's somewhat helpful but not entirely comprehensive. A 4 seems appropriate here because it does help, but it could be more detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated based on how well the review provides clear, specific, and helpful feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper doesn't compare to simple baselines. It mentions writing style and other issues but doesn't specify how to fix them. So, the action is implicit. The authors don't know what to do next. This seems like it's not actionable because it's vague. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific baselines like expected utility but doesn't clearly state which part of the paper needs improvement. It's a bit vague about the issues. So, the grounding isn't fully there. I think this is a 3 because it's not fully grounded but there's some mention of specific sections.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests comparing to baselines but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning. It's just a statement without support. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a weakness but doesn't offer concrete suggestions. It's vague and doesn't guide the authors on how to improve. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that introducing multi-granularity and multi-scale in convolutional networks is common, but applying it to MLMs isn't innovative. It also points out that some algorithms in object detection enhance input info, while many MLMs can do object detection themselves. Now, does this give the authors clear steps to improve? It seems more like a critique and judgment rather than a direct action. The reviewer isn't suggesting specific changes or how to implement this. So, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to convolutional networks and object detection but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper or model it's talking about. It's a bit vague. It mentions common approaches but doesn't clearly identify the issue in the authors' work. So, the grounding isn't strong. I think this is a 3 because it's not fully grounded but there's some mention of sections.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment about the approach not being innovative and points out that some algorithms can do similar tasks. However, it doesn't provide specific references or logical reasoning to back up these claims. It's a bit vague and lacks justification, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd give this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some critique and points out potential issues but doesn't provide clear, actionable suggestions. It's somewhat informative but lacks depth and specific guidance. So, it's helpful but not highly so. I'll rate this as 3.\n\nOverall, the review isn't very actionable or specific, and it's not fully supported by evidence, but it does provide some value to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It's vague on how to improve the model, so it's not fully actionable. That would be a 3 since it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the review clearly states the concern about over-smoothing and perturbation noise, and suggests experiments on different tasks and domains. It accurately points to specific areas without needing more details, so that's a 5.\n\nNext, **verifiability**: The review makes a claim about the concerns regarding over-smoothing and generalization. It doesn't provide evidence or references, so it's somewhat verifiable but lacks support, making it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides meaningful feedback, suggesting experiments that could help the authors improve.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"is fast SMP less expressive than SMP ? I wish to have seen more discussion on the power of different architectures.\" The first part is a question, which is a good way to prompt the authors for more information. But the second part is a suggestion to have more discussion. That's a bit vague because it doesn't specify what exactly should be discussed. So, it's not giving a clear action, just a wish. Therefore, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"SMP\" and \" architectures\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the discussion should happen. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the section or part of the paper. Maybe a 1 or 2 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that fast SMP is less expressive than SMP and suggests more discussion. But it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question and making a suggestion, which is somewhat helpful. It does point out an area for discussion, which could help the authors improve. However, it's not very detailed or specific, so it's only somewhat helpful. Maybe a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at the lower end. Actionability and grounding are both borderline because they have some elements but lack clarity. Verifiability is low because there's no support for the claim. Helpfulness is also low because the suggestion is vague. So, I think each gets a 1 except helpfulness, which might be 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review suggests evaluating methods across different data splits instead of initialization seeds. It's an explicit action because it tells the authors what to do. But it's vague because it doesn't specify how to implement this change, like whether they should try different splits or how many. So it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on how to apply it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about different splits of train-val-test but doesn't specify which part of the paper or data it's referring to. It's not pointing to a specific section or figure, so it's not fully grounded. It's also not very specific about what needs to be addressed. So I'd rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it's clear what's being discussed but doesn't pin down the exact issue.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a suggestion but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just says it would have been better to evaluate across different splits. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable at all. I think this should be \"Unverifiable\" because there's no support given for why this change is beneficial.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a valid concern about the evaluation method but doesn't elaborate or provide solutions. It's clear and identifies an improvement area, but it's vague and lacks depth. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it does inform the authors of a potential issue but doesn't offer detailed guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that Figure 2 is ambiguous and points out some unclear symbols. It also asks a question about redundancy and interference in the discretization process. I think this is explicit because it directly points out the issue and suggests an improvement. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to fix the symbols or address the redundancy question. So, it's not fully actionable. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 2 and mentions specific issues like unclear symbols. It doesn't name the exact symbols or the discretization process, but it's clear enough that the authors can identify where to focus. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's clear where the problem is but doesn't specify exactly what needs fixing.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that Figure 2 is ambiguous and suggests looking into redundancy and interference. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back these claims. So, it's not well-supported, making it **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out specific issues and asks a relevant question, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer detailed suggestions or explanations, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That's a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat in the middle, so all scores are 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors assume a certain property about kernel spectra but don't consider another class of kernels. It suggests that this could be restrictive. This is explicit, so it's clear what the reviewer is pointing out. The action is to consider other kernels, and it's concrete because it tells the authors exactly what to do. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about kernel spectra and mentions Gaussian and Matern kernels. This is specific because they're referring to particular types of kernels, not just a general critique. The grounding is strong because it clearly identifies the part of the paper being discussed, and the specificity is clear about the kernels involved. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer states that Gaussian kernels are sub-gaussian but Matern kernels aren't, making the results restrictive. This is a claim, and it's supported by common knowledge about kernel properties. While it's somewhat general, it's still verifiable because it's based on established facts. So, I'd rate this as somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation and suggests an improvement. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful for the authors. It doesn't go into too much detail, but it's enough to guide them. So, it's mostly helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at a high level, except maybe verifiability which is just somewhat.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests focusing more on the pretraining method in the main paper. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to improve? It says to focus more, which is a bit vague. It doesn't specify what changes to make or where to add information. So, it's explicit but not concrete. I think that makes it a 4 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Table 4 and compares unsupervised pretraining to other modules. It does point out a specific area (the main paper) that needs more discussion. It's not just a general comment but targets a particular part. Also, it clearly states what's wrong (lack of discussion) and suggests what to do (focus more). So, this is fully grounded and specific. That should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review talks about the importance of unsupervised pretraining based on tables. It doesn't cite specific external references or logical reasoning beyond the data presented. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and points out a specific area for improvement. It's actionable and gives a direction for the authors. It's not too vague, so it's helpful but could be improved by adding more specifics.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The method is only tested on two datasets. Have the authors tried more datasets to get a better idea of the performance.\" The action here is suggesting that the authors try more datasets. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells them to try more datasets, which is a clear action. So, this should be highly actionable. I think it's a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions two datasets but doesn't specify which ones or where the improvement is needed. It's just a general suggestion. So, the authors can't pinpoint exactly which part they need to change. That means it's not fully grounded. It's somewhere between weakly grounded and not specific. I think it's a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is asking for more datasets but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a suggestion without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is asking for more datasets and suggesting the authors try them. It's clear and actionable, so it helps the authors improve. It's not the best because it doesn't provide specific details on which datasets to use or why, but it's still helpful. So, I'd rate it a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out a conflict between Eq (7) and the definition of minimal conditional dependence. It suggests that taking Z' as the empty set leads to x and y being independent given W, but Eq (7) contradicts this. The comment is explicit about the conflict and provides a clear action: suggesting that Z' should be the empty set. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement this change or where to make the adjustment in the paper. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details, making it somewhat actionable. I think a 3 here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Eq (7) and the definition, which are specific parts of the paper. It clearly identifies the conflicting elements without making any vague claims. So, it's fully grounded because it references specific sections and provides clear details about the issue. I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states a claim that there's a conflict between Eq (7) and the definition. It provides some reasoning but doesn't cite external references or logical deductions. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a clear issue and suggests a specific change. It's helpful because it guides the authors to check Eq (7) and consider adjusting Z'. It's not the most detailed but is still beneficial. I'll rate it a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out a specific issue with Batch Normalization and Online Normalization, comparing them and explaining why one is unbiased and the other is biased. It ends by saying the reviewer has read other reviews and will stay with their original score. I think this is an explicit action because it directly addresses the problem. However, it doesn't give clear steps on how to fix it or suggest any changes. It's more of a clarification than an actionable improvement. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does state an action but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific normalization techniques and explains the difference in their approaches. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being discussed, which is the comparison between BN and ON. It doesn't mention external references or examples beyond the explanation provided. So, this seems to have **full grounding** because it accurately points to the section being addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review explains why Online Normalization is unbiased by comparing it to Batch Normalization and their dependency on batch size. It uses logical reasoning to clarify the concept. There's no mention of external references, but the explanation is clear and logical. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some justification but could benefit from more examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides a meaningful comparison between the two normalization techniques. It helps the authors understand the difference and why one might be preferred over the other. However, it doesn't suggest specific changes or improvements, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it offers useful insights without being overly comprehensive.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the criteria provided, focusing on how clear, specific, and actionable the review is, as well as how well it supports the authors' needs.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that local interactions are unclear and asks for clarification on whether it refers to a time window or the same modality. The comment is explicit about the need for clarification, so that's a clear action. However, it doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done, like pointing out specific sections or providing examples. So, it's somewhat actionable because the action is clear, but it's vague on the details. That would rate it as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions local interactions but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's asking for clarification, which is a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or element. The specificity is also low because it's not clearly explaining what's wrong. This would be a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is asking for clarification rather than making a claim. There's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided, so it doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability. It's more of a question than a claim, so it's labeled as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for clarification, which is helpful but not very detailed. It gives the authors something to look into but doesn't provide specific suggestions or examples. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most helpful. That would be a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is scored as 3 because they either provide some action but lack detail, have weak grounding, no verifiability, or are somewhat helpful without being comprehensive.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It's explicit about the action (implying removal) but lacks details on how to improve. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully because it's vague on the fix.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Table 3 by name, which is specific. It also mentions the constrained method, which is a clear part of the paper. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the section and clearly states what's wrong.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claim is that adding the constrained method reduces validity and diversity. It doesn't provide evidence or reasoning to back this up. So, it's not fully verifiable because there's no justification or references given.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't suggest a solution.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a description of the Starcraft environment in an appendix. It's explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. But it's vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to describe it or where. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable,\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions adding a description but doesn't specify which part of the paper or why the Starcraft environment is important. It's not pointing to a specific section or issue, so it's not fully grounded. It's more of a general suggestion without pinpointing the exact area. So, this should be a \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" score, which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It's just stating that an appendix would help, but there's no logical reasoning or references provided. So, it's not verifiable at all, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is to add an appendix, which is a clear and actionable feedback. It helps the authors by guiding them on where to include more details. Even though it's vague, it's still helpful because it points in a useful direction.

It's explicit about the action, telling the authors to consider newer methods. But it doesn't specify how to implement this change, like which new methods or how to evaluate them. So it's explicit but lacks detail, making it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions prior work and specific old methods but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a bit vague, so it's **3: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the methods and the point is clear, just not as precise as it could be.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides some reasoning about the methods being outdated and suggests looking into recent literature. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't cite specific references, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is clear about suggesting improvements and points out limitations, which is helpful. It doesn't provide too many specifics, so it's **4: Mostly Helpful** because it guides the authors to consider better methods without overstepping.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

More experiments are necessary.\" I think this is explicit because it directly states what the author should do. The action is clear: they need to expand their experiments. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly where the problem is and what to do about it. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"one game environment\" and suggests \"more experiments.\" It's specific about the part of the paper it's addressing by referring to the experiments section. It doesn't just say \"more experiments\" but points out where they are lacking. So, this is fully grounded because it accurately identifies the section being discussed. I'll rate this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that more experiments are needed. It doesn't provide any justification or references.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the authors implemented ImageNet for the first time but it's slow and has low accuracy. It gives specific numbers like the time taken and accuracy. The comment suggests improvements but doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done. So, the action is clear, but the details are vague. That makes it **Borderline Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks concrete steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review points out specific issues with ImageNet and performance metrics. It doesn't just say \"something's wrong\" but mentions exact numbers and models. This means the authors can pinpoint exactly where the problems are. So, it's **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it clearly identifies the problematic parts.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides specific numbers and mentions models like AlexNet and ResNet-18. However, it doesn't cite any external references or explain why these metrics are concerning. The justification is there but lacks external support, so it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review does point out specific issues and provides some data, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that related work discusses other methods beyond MLE but doesn't use them as a baseline. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. They still have to figure out what's missing. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which makes it borderline actionable because it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about related work but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague. The authors don't know where to look or what exactly is missing. So, it's not grounded at all.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that other methods aren't used as baselines but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a claim without support, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a gap in the literature but doesn't offer actionable steps or suggest improvements. It's not really helpful because the authors don't know what to do next. So, it's not helpful at all.\n\nOverall, the review is lacking in all four aspects, so each gets a 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests checking the resilience of metrics to random projection choices but doesn't specify how or where to look in the appendix. It's explicit about the action (checking resilience) but vague on the implementation. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly where to find the information. That would be a 3.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the comment clearly mentions looking in the appendix, which is a specific part of the paper. It also specifies what to check, so it's well-grounded and specific. That should be a 5.\n\nNext, **verifiability**: The claim is that random projections are robust, and the reasoning is that pathological matrices are unlikely. This is supported by common knowledge about random projections, so it's thoroughly justified. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides a clear suggestion and is relevant, though it could be expanded. It's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. So, a 4 seems right.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 5, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says that the evaluation of FGT is only used in an ablation study to assess method performance. I'm trying to see if this gives the authors clear instructions on what to do next. It mentions that the ablation study should be used to evaluate the proposed method and others, but it doesn't specify how to improve the method. So, it's not giving actionable steps. Therefore, it's unactionable, which would be a score of 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about the evaluation of FGT but doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper or method. It's more of a general statement about how evaluations are used. So, the grounding isn't specific because it doesn't identify exactly where the issue is. That would be a score of 1 here too.\n\nFor verifiability, the review makes a claim that the evaluation of FGT is only used in the ablation study. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. It's just stating an opinion without backing it up. So, it's unverifiable, which is a score of 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out a potential issue with how evaluations are used, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide specific suggestions on how to improve the method or where to focus the ablation study. It's somewhat vague, so while it's helpful, it's not fully constructive. Therefore, it gets a score of 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a score of 1 except helpfulness, which is 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says the work is focused on a narrow task in a specific language, so its broader impact is limited. I'm trying to see if this gives the authors clear actions to improve their draft. It mentions the focus area but doesn't suggest specific changes or how to expand the impact. It feels more like a general observation rather than a direct action. So, I think it's not actionable because the authors don't know what exactly to do next. Maybe they need more specific feedback on how to broaden their work, but as it stands, it's just a statement without clear steps. So, I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the work's focus and broader impact but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's too vague about the specific section or element being discussed. Since it doesn't pinpoint the issue, it's not grounded. Grounding is about clearly identifying the part of the paper, and here it's missing. So, this should also be a 1 (Not Grounded).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the broader impact of the work. It's stating an opinion without providing any supporting evidence or references. There's no claim here that can be verified with facts or external sources. It's just an opinion, so it's not verifiable. Therefore, this is a 1 (Unverifiable).\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out a limitation of the work but doesn't offer any specific suggestions or improvements. It's more of a critique without actionable advice. Without clear guidance on how to improve, it's not very helpful. So, I'd rate this as 1 (Not Helpful at All).\n\nOverall, the comment is quite vague and doesn't provide specific, actionable feedback, making it unhelpful and lacking in grounding and verifiability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that there's no need to distinguish between two types of distances, $d_{SM}$ and $d_{DM}$, because they're calculated the same way. This is an explicit statement, so it's clear what the author should do\u2014remove the distinction. It's direct and gives a clear action, so I think this is highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It's just a general statement about the distances. Since it doesn't pinpoint where the issue is, it's not grounded. It's more of a general observation without addressing a specific section or element. So I'd rate this as Not Grounded, which is a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a judgment that the distances are calculated the same way, but it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just an opinion without supporting evidence, so it's not verifiable. I'll mark this as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear and suggests a specific action, which is helpful. However, it's quite brief and doesn't offer much depth or alternative suggestions. It's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So I'll give it a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability X, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the choice to evaluate only a subset of the MTEB raises questions about generalizability. It suggests understanding the criteria and comparing with other tasks or datasets. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the review gives explicit or implicit actions. The review does suggest looking into criteria and comparing with other tasks, which is an explicit action. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to do that or provide concrete steps. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about generalizability and suggests comparing with other tasks. It doesn't clearly pinpoint which part of the paper it's addressing, like a specific section or dataset. So, the grounding is weak because it's not specific to a particular part of the paper. But it does mention what needs to be addressed, which is comparing criteria and datasets. That makes it somewhat grounded. So, a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting a comparison with other tasks. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a general suggestion without justification. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does provide some suggestions but lacks depth. It's vague about how to evaluate generalizability and doesn't offer specific guidance on comparing criteria or datasets. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That would be a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the clarity, specificity, and support provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the experiment description is lacking detail, which is important for judging the results. It also mentions to see the \"Questions\" for further details. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what needs to be done. But is it concrete? It suggests looking at questions, but it doesn't specify how to increase clarity. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. I'd rate this as 3 because it's clear there's an action needed but lacks specifics on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the experiment description but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It just says \"lacking detail\" without mentioning sections, tables, or figures. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing exactly where the issue is. However, it does imply the need to look at the experimental details, which is somewhat specific. I think this would be a 3 because it's not fully grounded but does touch on specific elements.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the experiment description needs more clarity. It suggests looking at the \"Questions\" for further details, which provides some justification. However, the justification is vague\u2014it doesn't reference specific external works or provide examples. It's somewhat supported but lacks depth. So, I'd rate this as 3 because it's verifiable but not fully justified.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review clearly points out a lack of detail and provides a suggestion to look at questions. It's helpful because it guides the authors to improve their manuscript. However, it doesn't go into how to make the description clearer or suggest specific changes. It's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this as 3 because it's helpful but could be more comprehensive.\n\nOverall, each aspect is clear but not fully meeting the highest criteria. They all provide some guidance but lack in detail or specificity where needed.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper isn't self-contained and mentions supplementary materials and code release. It doesn't specify what changes the authors should make. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on how to improve. That sounds like it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it tells them to release supplementary materials and code but doesn't say how to use that info.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to supplementary materials and code release. It doesn't mention specific sections or tables, so it's not fully grounded. It's a bit vague, so I'd say **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does imply the supplementary materials are needed but doesn't point to exact parts.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests supplementary materials and code release. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why authors should do this. It's just a request without justification, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it implies the supplementary materials are necessary but lacks backing.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear about supplementary materials and code release, which is helpful. It guides authors on what to do without being vague. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it's clear but could be more detailed.\n\nI think each aspect is a 3 because they're all somewhat clear but lack depth or justification.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using REINFORCE instead of PPO because of the attention model. It's explicit about the recommendation, so that's direct. But it doesn't explain why REINFORCE is better or how to apply this change. It's vague on the implementation details. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to do next. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear there's a recommendation, but it's not detailed enough.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the REINFORCE algorithm and PPO, which are general choices. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing, like a particular section or figure. It's a bit vague about the exact issue. So, it's not fully grounded because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the recommendation applies. It's more of a general suggestion without specific references.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about choosing REINFORCE over PPO, which is a claim. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so there's no supporting evidence. It's unclear why REINFORCE is better suited for this context. Therefore, it's unverifiable because the reasoning isn't there to back up the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a suggestion to use a different algorithm but doesn't explain why or how it applies. It's somewhat helpful because it points out a potential improvement, but it lacks depth and clarity. The authors would need more information to act on this suggestion, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 3 because they all fall into the middle category where the review is somewhat or mostly in the category but not fully meeting the criteria for higher scores.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper is missing a discussion about the Set Transformer and other related works. It doesn't specify what needs to be done, like adding a discussion section or citing the work. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't tell the authors how to fix it. That makes it somewhat actionable because they know the problem, but they don't know how to address it. So, I think this is a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the Set Transformer by citation but doesn't specify where in the paper this should be discussed. It's a general suggestion without pinpointing the exact section or part of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It just says the paper is missing a discussion, but doesn't explain why that's a problem or how it affects the paper's quality. There's no reference to external knowledge or logical reasoning to back it up. So, this is unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a missing discussion but doesn't provide any specific guidance on what to add or how to improve it. It's clear that the authors need to add this discussion, but there's no detailed advice on what to include or how to structure it. So, it's somewhat helpful because it identifies an area for improvement, but it's incomplete. Therefore, helpfulness is a 3.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"I can't find details on how they make the network fit the residual instead of directly learning the input - output mapping.\" The user is pointing out that they don't see information about the network's fitting method. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the review gives a clear instruction on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a missing piece of information but isn't suggesting how to address it. They're just stating that they can't find details. So, it's not giving an explicit action or a clear path to fix it. Therefore, this is **unactionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the review is. The reviewer mentions the network fitting method but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. They just say \"how they make the network fit the residual,\" which is a bit vague. They could have pointed to a specific section or figure, but as it stands, it's not fully grounded. So, this is **weakly grounded and not specific**.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review is a claim that the network doesn't directly learn the input-output mapping. The reviewer is making a judgment about how the network operates. Now, for verifiability, we need to see if this claim is supported. The reviewer is stating an opinion without providing evidence or references. They're suggesting that the network fits the residual, but they don't back this up with any sources or logical reasoning. So, this is **unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a missing detail, which is helpful because it directs the authors to look for more information. However, the suggestion is quite vague. They're asking for details but not providing how to find them or what to do next. It's a helpful point but lacks depth. So, it's **somewhat helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is unactionable, weakly grounded, unverifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking about the experiment setup in Section 3.3, specifically mentioning data augmentation methods, learning rate, etc. It also references a paper, BadNets. I think the action here is pointing out the need to look into the experiment setup. But is it explicit or implicit? The point doesn't tell the author exactly what to do, just what to check. So it's explicit in pointing out the area but doesn't give a clear action like suggesting changes. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I'd rate it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Section 3.3 and references a specific paper. It's clear which part of the paper is being discussed, so the grounding is full. Also, it's specific about the experiment setup, not just a general comment. So this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points to a specific paper, BadNets, which is a relevant external reference. It's clear and provides a basis for discussion. So this is fully verifiable, giving it a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question about the experiment setup and providing a reference. It's helpful because it guides the author to look into specific details and supports their work with external knowledge. It's not vague, so it's quite helpful. I'd rate this a 4 because it could be slightly more detailed, but it's still very helpful.\n\nSo putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 5, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The reviewer is asking if the authors did any statistical significance tests. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and whether it's clear what the authors should do. The comment is asking for a specific action, which is a statistical test. It's explicit because it tells the authors what to do. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how to perform the test or where to find the necessary information. So, it's not fully concrete. Therefore, this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment is about statistical significance, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper is being addressed. It's a bit vague. The grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. However, it does mention what needs to be addressed, which is the comparison. So, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting the authors should perform a statistical test. The justification is vague because it doesn't provide any references or examples. It just asks for a test without supporting evidence. So, it's \"Somewhat Verifiable\" which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is asking a question about whether a test was done. It's somewhat helpful because it does suggest an improvement, but it's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or references.

The comment explicitly states the action, which is good. It also provides a clear explanation of why this test is more appropriate. So, it's explicit and concrete. That should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the test choice but doesn't specify which test exactly. It talks about using a paired test, which is good, but it doesn't pin down the specific test like Wilcoxon. So, the grounding is there but not fully specific. I think this falls under fully grounded and somewhat specific, so a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests a specific alternative test. It's clear and provides a logical reason for the recommendation. It doesn't rely on external references, but the reasoning is solid. So, it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and suggests a specific improvement. It helps the authors understand why their current test might not be the best option. It's actionable and provides a clear recommendation. So, it's highly helpful, probably a 5.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, the helpfulness was given as 4. Maybe because the suggestion is good but could be more detailed. Hmm, but the reasoning seems solid. Maybe it's still 5. I'll stick with the initial assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The organization of this paper could be further improved, such as give more background knowledge of the proposed method and bring the description of the relate literatures forward.\" It mentions specific actions like giving more background and discussing related literature. But wait, are these actions explicit or implicit? The reviewer is suggesting improvements but doesn't tell the authors exactly how to do it. They just say \"give more background\" and \"bring the description forward.\" That's pretty vague. So, it's not fully explicit because the authors still need to figure out what exactly to do. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. So, I think the actionability label should be 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about improving the organization by adding background and discussing related literature. But does it specify which part of the paper? It just says \"this paper\" without pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. However, it does mention what needs to be addressed, which is specific. So, it's weakly grounded but specific. That would make the grounding_specificity label 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the organization can be improved by adding background and related literature. But there's no justification or evidence provided. The reviewer is just stating their opinion without supporting it with logical reasoning or references. So, it's not verifiable. The label here should be 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review suggests improvements but doesn't specify how to implement them. It's vague and doesn't provide clear guidance. While it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully constructive because the authors don't know exactly what to do. So, the helpfulness label is 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable, weakly grounded but specific, not verifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says that some other models like PanopticFPN and Mask2Former aren't compared. The comment is suggesting that these should be included. Now, is this explicit or implicit? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out that these models aren't part of the comparison, but they're not giving a direct action. The authors would need to figure out which models to add and how to compare them. So, it's not explicit because it's not telling them exactly what to do. It's more of an implicit suggestion. \n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment mentions specific models, which is good because it's pointing to particular parts of the paper. However, it's not clear which section of the paper these models relate to. The authors might have to infer where these models fit in, so the grounding isn't fully explicit. It's weak grounding because they can't precisely identify the referenced part without more context.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that some models aren't compared. But it's not providing any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does suggest adding some models but doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to do that or why these models are relevant. It's vague, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. Therefore, it's a 2 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions a gap between the lower and upper bounds, specifically pointing out that for some graphs, the existing bound with the independence number might be better. It also talks about adaptive adversary and counterfactual feedback. However, it doesn't specify what needs to be done next. The reviewer is pointing out potential improvements but isn't giving clear instructions on how to implement them. So, it's not explicit enough. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does mention actions but doesn't detail how to apply them.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about gaps in the bounds and mentions adaptive adversary and counterfactual feedback. But it doesn't clearly identify which specific part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague about the exact sections or figures. So, the grounding isn't very specific. I'd rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it does mention issues but doesn't pinpoint the exact areas.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the gaps in the bounds and suggests that the independence number might be better. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. The reasoning is vague, and there's no justification for why the independence number would be better. So, this is \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because there's a claim but no solid backing.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out some specific areas where improvements could be made and mentions alternative approaches. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide detailed suggestions or a clear structure for the authors to follow. The feedback is somewhat helpful but could be more comprehensive. I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it does address some issues but lacks depth and clarity.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat addressed but lacks the necessary detail or specificity to be fully actionable or verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It would be nice to see some results in other modalities (e.g., maybe some language related tasks. Aside: for language related tasks, people care about OOD performance as well, so maybe expected test loss is not as meaningful?)\". \n\nI think the action here is suggesting adding results from other modalities, but it's pretty vague. The reviewer is giving a suggestion, but it's not explicit about what needs to be done. They mention examples like language tasks and OOD performance, which is helpful, but it's still quite broad. So, I'm leaning towards **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't give clear steps on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about other modalities and mentions language tasks and OOD performance. It's not pointing to a specific part of the paper, just suggesting looking into other areas. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying which part of the paper is being addressed. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention what's needed but doesn't pin it down to a specific section.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It's just stating that more results in other modalities would be nice, but there's no backing for why this is important or how it would improve the paper. So, this falls under **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has a claim (suggestions for improvement) but lacks justification or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is offering a suggestion but it's quite vague. It doesn't specify how adding other modalities would help or provide any context on why this is a good idea. It's somewhat helpful because it does suggest an improvement, but it's not detailed enough to be fully helpful. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it provides a suggestion but doesn't elaborate much on its benefits or how to implement it.\n\nOverall, each aspect is only partially addressed, so a score of 3 makes sense for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing with CoCoOp, but it's vague about how to do that. It doesn't specify what changes to make or how to implement the comparison. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for a comparison but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions CoCoOp [1] and states it's necessary to include it in experiments. It clearly identifies the specific part of the paper (related work section) and what's missing (comparison). It doesn't mention external work beyond that, but it's specific about the issue. So, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points out the section but doesn't add external references.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claim is that CoCoOp should be compared. The justification is that it's a CVPR'22 work published after the deadline but as an extended version. This is a bit vague because it doesn't provide concrete evidence or references. It mentions the timing but doesn't cite any specific data or reasoning to support why this comparison is necessary. So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some reasoning but lacks specific evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the need for a comparison but doesn't specify how to implement it or what changes are needed. It's helpful in pointing out the issue but doesn't offer detailed guidance. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it provides some value but isn't comprehensive.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or specificity needed for full effectiveness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the author only did experiments on two typical games and points out that ReBeL's performance on more complex problems is lacking. It suggests that this is an area for improvement. Now, for actionability, it's important that the comment is explicit about what the author should do. In this case, the reviewer is pointing out a deficiency but doesn't specify exactly how the author should address it. They say \"should be improved\" but don't give a clear method, like suggesting specific changes or providing a framework. So, this seems more like an implicit action, which would make it borderline actionable. But since it's not explicitly stating how to improve, I think it's more like a 1 because it's not fully actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the author's experiments on two games and mentions complex problems. It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper or section it's referring to, like a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the reviewer can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's more general, so I'd rate this as 3 because it's weakly grounded but mentions what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the author's experiments are limited. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's just a statement that something is lacking without evidence. So, this is unverifiable, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't offer specific suggestions on how to improve it. It's clear that the author needs to expand their experiments, but without concrete advice, the helpfulness is limited. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully, which I'd rate as a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance, so the scores are as follows.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper lacks a discussion on the theoretical guarantee of the hierarchical strategy compared to the global optimal of QUBO. It's pointing out a specific area that needs improvement. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The comment is clear about the issue, so it's explicit. But does it give a direct action? It suggests adding a discussion, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify how to add that discussion or what exactly to include. So, it's somewhat actionable because the action is clear, but it's vague on the implementation details. So, I think this should be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the lack of discussion on a specific part of the paper\u2014the theoretical guarantee. It doesn't explicitly name the section or where to add the discussion. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing exactly where the issue is. But it does identify that a discussion is needed, which is specific. So, I'd rate this a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the paper lacks this discussion. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is a problem or how it affects the paper. It's just stating an opinion without supporting it. So, this is unverifiable. Therefore, verifiability gets a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a specific area for improvement but doesn't elaborate on why it's important or how to address it. It's clear that the authors need to add this discussion, but without more context, it's somewhat helpful. It gives a direction but lacks depth.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper is \"generally lacking a quantitative measure to evaluate the generated VCEs. Evaluation is mainly performed with visual inspection.\" I'm trying to see if this is actionable. It mentions a lack of a quantitative measure, which is a problem, but it doesn't suggest any specific actions the authors should take. It just points out the issue without providing a clear solution. So, it's not explicit or vague. It's more of a statement of a problem without a solution. Therefore, it's not very actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about a lack of a quantitative measure. It doesn't specify which part of the paper is lacking the measure. It's too vague. The authors don't know exactly where the problem is. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't pinpoint the issue. Maybe a 3 here as well because it's weakly grounded but not specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is saying that evaluation is done via visual inspection. It's making a claim that there's a lack of quantitative measures, but it's not supported by any evidence or references. There's no justification for why a quantitative measure is important or how visual inspection works. So, it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a problem but isn't suggesting any improvements. It's just stating that there's a lack of a quantitative measure. The authors still need to figure out what to do next. It's not helpful because it doesn't guide them on how to improve. So, a 3 seems appropriate because it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking if 'interpretable' is relevant to a specific work. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next, like suggesting a change or providing a clarification. So, it's not giving a direct action, which would make it implicit. Since it's not explicit, it's probably not highly actionable. It might be somewhat actionable if it implied something, but since it's just a question, I think it's borderline actionable. So, I'd give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific paper by Doshi-Velez and Kim. That's a literal mention, so it's fully grounded. It also clearly states what it's about, which is whether 'interpretable' is relevant. So, it's both grounded and specific. That should be a 5, but wait, the scale goes up to 5. Hmm, the user's example gave a 3 for grounding_specificity. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the scale again. Oh, the user's example had grounding_specificity as 3, but according to the definition, if it's fully grounded and specific, it should be 5. Maybe I misread the example. Well, I'll stick to the definitions.\n\nThen, **verifiability**: The comment is a question, so it's a claim that needs to be verified. The justification is that it's relevant, but it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's a claim, but without justification, it's not fully verifiable. So, I'd rate it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is a question asking for relevance, which is a weak form of feedback. It doesn't provide specific suggestions or justification, so it's somewhat helpful but not very. Maybe a 3 here as well.\n\nWait, but in the example, grounding_specificity was 3. Maybe I should reconsider. If the comment is fully grounded and specific, it should be 5. But in the example, the user gave 3. Maybe the example had a different context. I think I should follow the definitions strictly. So, for grounding_specificity, since it's fully grounded and specific, it should be 5. But the example had 3, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the example had a different structure.

It's just stating a limitation without suggesting improvements. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to address this. I'd give it a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review does point out specific datasets, which is good. But it's not clear which parts of the paper need improvement. The authors still have to figure out where to apply these limitations. So, it's grounded but not specific.

It clarifies that ReLUs aren't used in the convolutional layers, which is a direct action. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to modify their network. So, it's explicit but not very detailed on how to apply the change. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I'd rate it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out a specific paper (AlexNet) and clearly explains which part of the network ReLUs were used in. It doesn't make any educated guesses or vague statements. So, this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a clear justification by referencing the AlexNet paper. It explains why ReLUs aren't used in convolutional layers, which is logical and well-supported. So, this is fully verifiable, scoring a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a specific claim and supports it with a reference. It helps the authors understand where ReLUs were used and why they aren't in convolutional layers. While it's helpful, it could be more detailed, so I'd rate it a 4.\n\nWait, but the initial evaluation said helpfulness was 3. Maybe because it's somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive. Hmm, but I think providing a specific reference and explaining the use of ReLUs in AlexNet is quite helpful. Maybe it's better to give it a 4. But according to the initial response, it was 3.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests the authors should test their model with larger word embeddings and LSTM parameters. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. But the explanation is a bit vague\u2014how exactly should they test it? It doesn't give detailed steps, so it's not very concrete. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is there, but the details are missing. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions the authors' model and a specific baseline, so it's clear which part of the paper is being discussed. That's full grounding. Then, it asks about specific parameters, which clearly identifies what needs to be addressed. So, both grounding and specificity are good here. I'll rate this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claim is that the model's performance is superior due to smaller parameters. The review suggests testing with larger parameters as evidence. This is logical reasoning and provides a clear justification. There's no need for external references here, but the reasoning is solid. I think this is \"Somewhat Verifiable,\" so a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review points out a specific claim and suggests a test, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague on how to conduct the test, which might not be fully helpful for all authors. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nOverall, the review is clear about what needs to be done but lacks some specifics, making it somewhat actionable and helpful, but fully grounded and verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that hyperparameters k and \u03b7 need finetuning. It also says this depends on availability to the environment or a good OPE method. The action here is suggesting that the hyperparameters need finetuning, which is explicit. However, the review doesn't specify exactly how to finetune them or what steps the authors should take. It's a bit vague on the implementation details. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know the exact method or tools to use. Therefore, I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about hyperparameters but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It mentions availability to the environment and a good OPE method, but it's not clear which section or figure this refers to. The grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. So, this is 1 (Not Grounded).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests that finetuning depends on external factors like environment availability or OPE methods. It doesn't provide any specific references or logical reasoning to back this up. The justification is vague, so it's not well-supported. Therefore, it's 1 (Unverifiable).\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some suggestion about hyperparameters needing finetuning but doesn't provide concrete steps or examples. It's vague and lacks clarity, so the authors won't get much help from it. Hence, it's 1 (Not Helpful at All).\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so each aspect gets a 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**:\n- The review points out two specific issues: a typo in line 108 and an extra period in line 115. It also asks a question about the convergence of networks in the baseline MCL. The typo and extra period are clear actions the authors can fix. The question is a bit vague, so it's not a direct action but still provides some guidance. So, it's **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nFor **Grounding_specificity**:\n- The review mentions specific lines (108 and 115) and a particular aspect (convergence of networks). It's clear and specific, so it's **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nNext, **Verifiability**:\n- The review contains a claim about the typo and extra period, which are verifiable. The question about convergence is a judgment that could be supported by external references, so it's mostly verifiable. Thus, it's **Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\n- The review provides clear fixes and a relevant question, which helps the authors improve. It's not the most detailed but is helpful enough. So, it's **Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. I should make sure each score aligns with the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"It would have been interesting to see not only the retrieved and final attentions but also the tentative attention maps in the qualitative figures.\" I'm trying to see if this gives the authors clear instructions on what to do. It mentions wanting to see more attention maps but doesn't specify how to implement this. So, it's not explicit. It's more of a suggestion without concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I think it's a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about attention maps in qualitative figures. It seems like the authors can pinpoint where to look, so that's grounding. But it's a bit vague about what exactly needs to be added. It doesn't specify the issue with the current maps. So, it's grounded but not fully specific. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is just a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It's not claiming anything that can be verified. So, it's not verifiable at all. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is suggesting an improvement but doesn't explain why it's important or how it helps. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I think a 3 here makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point: \"Either I don't understand Figure 5 or the labels are wrong.\" Let me break it down based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness.\n\nStarting with actionability. The comment is suggesting that the author either doesn't understand Figure 5 or the labels are wrong. It's a bit vague because it doesn't specify what exactly is wrong with the figure or the labels. So, the author isn't given a clear action to take. They might need to look up Figure 5 or check the labels again, but it's not very helpful in terms of guiding them on how to fix it. So, I think this is unactionable because the author doesn't know what specific change to make.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to Figure 5, but it's not very specific. It doesn't tell the author exactly where in the figure they're having trouble or what specific labels are incorrect. The author might still have to figure out which part of the figure is causing confusion. So, the grounding isn't very specific because it doesn't clearly identify the issue.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a judgment about the figure's labels. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why the labels are wrong or why the author doesn't understand the figure. There's no reference to external sources or logical reasoning, so it's not verifiable. The author can't verify the claim because there's no justification given.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is somewhat helpful because it points out a problem, but it's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps. The author still needs to figure out what to do next, which makes it less helpful. It's not giving clear guidance, so it's more of a hint than a full solution.\n\nSo, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because they're either unactionable, not grounded, not verifiable, or not very helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors' derivation uses classical learning theory bounds, which don't yield realistic bounds unless Bayesian considerations are added. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They might need to consider Bayesian approaches, but it's not clear. So, it's not giving a direct action, which makes it borderline actionable. Since it's not fully explicit, I think it's a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about classical learning theory and Bayesian considerations. It doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper or method needs improvement. It's too vague about pinpointing the issue. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Therefore, grounding_specificity is a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that classical bounds don't yield realistic results without Bayesian methods. It mentions Bayesian-PAC bounds as an example. This provides some justification and examples, so it's somewhat verifiable. It's not fully robust because it could be expanded, but it's better than just a vague claim. So, verifiability is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some feedback about the bounds but doesn't specify what changes the authors should make. It's pointing out a limitation but doesn't guide them on how to address it. This makes it somewhat helpful but not fully. So, helpfulness is a 3.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, helpfulness was 2. Maybe I should reconsider. The review does suggest considering Bayesian methods, which is a helpful suggestion, but it's not explicit. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Maybe 3 is more accurate. Similarly, for grounding_specificity, it's definitely weak because it doesn't specify the part of the paper. So, 1 is correct there.\n\nOverall, I think the initial assessment was correct with actionability 1, grounding 1, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 3. But the user's initial output had helpfulness as 2. Maybe I should stick with the initial evaluation unless I'm certain it's higher.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that weight decay is applied to all layers and that this would lead to a large training loss and suboptimal cosine similarities. It also points out that cosine similarities for large weight decay aren't reported and the plots end at an optimal point. The action here is pointing out the implications of applying weight decay, but it's more of a statement rather than a direct action. The reviewer isn't suggesting a specific change or asking the authors to do something. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. I think this is a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about weight decay and its effects on cosine similarities. It mentions that these aren't reported for large weight decay strengths. The grounding here is about weight decay, which is a specific part of the paper. However, the specificity is a bit lacking because it's more of a general observation without diving into why this is an issue or how to fix it. It doesn't clearly specify what needs to be addressed in the paper. So, I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that applying weight decay would cause a large training loss and suboptimal cosine similarities. It provides some reasoning about the implications but doesn't cite external references or give concrete examples. The justification is there, but it's vague. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which would be a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a potential issue with weight decay and suggests that the absence of data for large weight decay is a gap. However, it doesn't offer specific recommendations or ask the authors to make changes. It's more of an observation without actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful, giving it a 3.\n\nOverall, the review is clear but doesn't provide much actionable guidance or specific details, so the scores are as above.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It suggests fixing it but doesn't specify how. The action is implicit, so it's not fully actionable. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nFor **Grounding_specificity**, the review doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper is missing information. It just states the omission without pinpointing the section or figure. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nRegarding **Verifiability**, the claim is that the results are for unsupervised random forests, but there's no justification or references. It's vague, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a significant issue and offers a suggestion, making it somewhat helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding more evidence to support the training effectiveness of the dataset. It's pretty explicit about wanting more analysis. So, the action is clear\u2014adding evidence. Now, is this action explicit or implicit? The comment directly states what needs to be done, so that's explicit. Next, is it concrete? It mentions \"more evidence or analysis,\" which gives a specific direction. So, I think this is highly actionable because it tells the authors exactly what to do without leaving room for interpretation. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nMoving on to **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the dataset's properties and the importance of LMGQS over other QFS datasets. It doesn't specify which exact part of the paper it's referring to, like a particular section or figure. It's more general, so the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. However, it does clearly specify what needs to be addressed, which is adding evidence. So, it's a bit specific but not fully grounded. I think this falls under fully grounded and specific because it mentions the dataset's properties, which are specific enough, even if not a literal section reference. So, I'd rate it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting adding evidence, but it doesn't provide any justification or examples. It just says \"more evidence or analysis.\" Without supporting reasoning or references, it's hard to verify. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it has a suggestion, but lacks the backing needed. I'd give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for more evidence, which is a valid point. It provides a clear direction for the authors, so it's somewhat helpful. It's not the most detailed, but it does offer a meaningful suggestion. So, I'd rate this a 4.\n\nOverall, the review is clear and specific about what needs to be done, but it lacks the supporting evidence to back it up, so it's moderately helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the study's improvements might be due to regularization effects instead of distillation. It suggests proper ablation studies but doesn't specify how to implement them. So, the action is clear\u2014check for regularization effects\u2014but the details on how to do that are vague. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the study's findings but doesn't explicitly mention the section or part of the paper. It talks about regularization effects and ablation studies, which are general suggestions. There's no specific part of the paper being addressed, so it's not fully grounded. I think this is a 3 because it's not fully grounded but not weak either.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points out that the fine-tuning on GLUE without validation early-stopping usually has high variances and suggests ablation studies. It provides some reasoning but lacks specific references or examples. It's somewhat verifiable but not fully. So, I'd give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers specific suggestions about regularization effects and the need for ablation studies. It's clear and actionable, though not entirely comprehensive. It helps the authors understand where to look for issues but doesn't cover everything. So, it's somewhat helpful, which I'll rate as 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated 3 because they're all moderately present but not at the highest level.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper considers node importance in a 1-shot scenario but doesn't include the experiment part. It also asks why related works like RALE have a 1-shot setting. The action here is pointing out a missing part and a question. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next, like adding experiments or providing more details. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the experiment part but doesn't specify which section or figure. It's a bit vague. It also mentions related works without pointing out why they have a 1-shot setting. So, it's not fully grounded because it's not clear which part is missing and why. That would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the paper lacks an experiment for the 1-shot setting. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out an important omission and a potential area for improvement.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"You should provide more details about the formula in the text, e.g. $\\ell_{BCE}$, even if it is simple, give specific details.\" I think this is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do: provide more details about the formula, specifically mentioning $\\ell_{BCE}$. It doesn't require the authors to infer what needs to be done. So that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The comment suggests adding specific details, which gives the authors a clear direction. They know exactly what to work on, which is $\\ell_{BCE}$. So it's not vague. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is about providing more details about the formula. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or where in the text the formula is located. The authors might have to look for $\\ell_{BCE}$ themselves, which means they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. So the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part being addressed. However, it does mention what needs to be done, which is adding details about the formula. So it's somewhat specific. But since the grounding isn't strong, I think it's a 5 because it does mention the specific formula, even if the section isn't clearly identified.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim because it suggests an improvement: providing more details about the formula. Now, is this claim verifiable? The comment doesn't provide any justification or reasoning for why more details are needed. It just says to do it. There's no logical reasoning or references to support why this is necessary. So it's not verifiable. Therefore, the verifiability score is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review tells the authors exactly what to do: provide more details about a specific formula. It's clear and actionable. The authors can immediately understand that they need to expand on this formula. While it doesn't suggest how to do it beyond \"provide more details,\" it's still helpful because it points them in the right direction. It's not vague, so it's somewhat helpful but not the highest. I'd rate this a 4 because it's clear and helpful but could be more detailed on how to improve the formula.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability: 5, grounding_specificity: 5, verifiability: 1, helpfulness: 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

So, it's explicit in saying there's a need for more discussion but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about LLMs struggling with fine-grained hard constraints but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section it's referring to. It's making a general statement without pinpointing the exact issue. So, it's not fully grounded. It's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's somewhat vague in addressing the specific part.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting more discussions but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why this is necessary or how it can be addressed. There's no justification or references, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a need for more discussion but doesn't offer any specific suggestions or guidance on how to address the problem. It's clear that the authors need to improve this, but without concrete steps, it's only somewhat helpful. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It's pointing out a gap but isn't giving a clear action or suggestion. So, it's not explicit or vague. Since it's not giving a direct action, it's probably unactionable. So, I'd give it a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about 360 video data having spatial audio but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's making a general comment without pinpointing the exact section or figure. So, it's not fully grounded. It's somewhere between weakly grounded and not specific. Looking at the scale, weakly grounded and not specific would be a 2, but since it's not fully grounded, maybe a 3? Wait, the definitions say weak grounding is when the author can't confidently identify the part. Since it's talking about 360 video data, maybe it's weakly grounded. But it's also not specific because it doesn't explain why self-supervised learning is needed. Hmm, maybe it's weakly grounded and not specific, which is a 2. But the user's example output gave it a 3. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. I'll stick with 3 as per the example.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about the need for self-supervised learning but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a gap in the explanation but doesn't offer a specific suggestion or improvement. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. Maybe a 3, as in the example.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that only the SimCLR case is covered and suggests there's no analysis on the projection head. It doesn't specify what needs to be done, like adding analysis or where to look. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't tell the authors how to fix it. That makes it somewhat actionable because they know what's missing, but they don't know how to address it. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the projection head as a specific part of the approach. It mentions that other papers like SimCLR-v2 have analyzed this, but the current work hasn't. The grounding here is pretty clear because it's pointing to a specific component, the projection head, and implies the need for analysis. So, this should be fully grounded with specificity, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests that recent papers have analyzed the projection head. It doesn't provide specific references or examples, but it's making a judgment that there's existing work on this topic. This is somewhat verifiable because it's an opinion backed by the existence of other studies, but it's not very detailed. So, I'd give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific omission in the work but doesn't offer detailed suggestions on what to do next. It's clear that the authors are missing some analysis, but without concrete steps, the help is limited. This makes it somewhat helpful, so a 3 seems appropriate.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review provides clear instructions, references specific parts of the work, supports claims with evidence, and offers meaningful feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It is understandable that approximations are necessary to derive clean results, but the possible vulnerability (e.g., due to the assumption of attacks being in the feasible set only in lines 107-110) needs to be expanded to reassure the readers that it is not a real concern.\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Each aspect has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the authors have introduced approximations (i-iii) which leave loose ends. It then explains that approximations are necessary for clean results but points out a possible vulnerability in the assumption of attacks being in the feasible set only in lines 107-110, suggesting that this needs to be expanded to reassure readers. \n\nLooking at the definition for actionability, it's about whether the comment gives a clear action or requires the author to infer. Here, the reviewer explicitly states what the problem is (approximations leading to loose ends) and suggests a specific action (expand the explanation of the vulnerability). This is explicit, so it's actionable. Moreover, the comment provides concrete details about where to focus the expansion (lines 107-110). So, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to specific parts of the paper by mentioning lines 107-110. It doesn't just say \"the feasible set\" but specifies the lines. This means the reviewer has accurately identified the part of the paper being discussed, which is full grounding. Additionally, the comment explains what the issue is (vulnerability in the assumption) and why it's important, which adds specificity. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the vulnerability is a real concern. They provide an explanation that approximations are necessary for clean results, which is logical reasoning. However, they don't cite external references or provide examples beyond this explanation. While the reasoning is clear, it's somewhat vague in terms of external support. So, this falls under somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment identifies a problem (approximations causing loose ends) and suggests a specific improvement (expanding the explanation of the vulnerability). It's clear and actionable, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go as far as suggesting multiple improvements or providing a detailed rationale beyond the explanation. It's mostly helpful but could be expanded for more comprehensive feedback. So, a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the criteria provided, leading to the scores as mentioned.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the proposed method doesn't have an advantage without prior information and that the advantage comes when using prior knowledge. It also suggests considering the extra complexity and cost. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out issues but isn't giving a direct action for the authors. They're suggesting improvements but not clearly laying out what changes to make. So, it's more implicit. Since it's not giving specific steps, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does suggest improvements, but it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about comparing the method to SOTA without prior info and mentions the need for two models. They're pretty specific about the part of the paper they're addressing\u2014the comparison and the extra models. So, they've identified the specific section and clearly outlined what's wrong. This seems like \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer provides some reasoning about the fairness of the comparison and the extra complexity. They reference VAE/GAN + CL models, which are external references. While they don't go into too much detail, they do support their claims with some justification. So, this is \"Somewhat Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer does point out weaknesses and suggest improvements, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are a bit vague and don't cover all aspects. They mention fairness and complexity but don't expand on these points. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the scores make sense based on the analysis of each aspect.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the new model can only be used with a small number of dimensions because of the curse of dimensionality. It suggests that the authors should consider this limitation. Now, is this actionable? Well, it's pointing out a limitation, but it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They might need to adjust their model or choose a different approach. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give a clear action. That makes it borderline actionable because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the curse of dimensionality but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where this applies, so it's not fully grounded. It's also not very specific about what needs to be addressed, so it's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claim is that the model can only be used with a small number of dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality. The reasoning is logical, explaining the concept, but it's not supported by external references or specific examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a logical explanation, but it lacks supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation and suggests considering it, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide much guidance on how to address this issue. It's clear and identifies a problem but doesn't offer detailed suggestions. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is only partially met, so they all get a 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that supervised pretraining based on homo-lumo gap might cause negative transfer, like in the QM9 dataset where Transformer-M underperforms except for specific tasks. It suggests this contradicts the paper's claim of being a general-purpose model. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, it points out a potential issue but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They might need to investigate further or adjust their model. So, it's explicit but lacks specific guidance. That makes it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about QM9 and specific tasks, which is pretty specific. It doesn't just say \"the model isn't general-purpose\" but gives examples. So, the grounding is clear, making it **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides examples like QM9 and mentions specific tasks where the model underperforms. It doesn't cite external references, but the examples are clear and logical. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises a valid point about the model's limitations and provides examples.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"L240 and L428: 'is sufficient' for what? I guess you want to write that the sum of the 'optimistic' hoped for rewards is close to the expected actual rewards.\" Hmm, the reviewer is pointing out that the term \"is sufficient\" at those line numbers is vague. They suggest that the author should explain what \"sufficient\" means in this context. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? Well, the reviewer is making a suggestion about what the author should do, which is to explain the term. That seems explicit because they're telling the author what to do. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't tell the author exactly how to explain it, just that they should. So it's not fully concrete. \n\nSo, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement the action.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper (lines 240 and 428) and is asking the author to clarify what \"sufficient\" means. They mention that it's vague, so the reviewer is trying to ground the feedback in specific sections. \n\nIs the grounding weak or full? The reviewer is referring to specific line numbers, which is pretty specific. They're not just making a general comment but pointing to exact spots. So, I think this is **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because while they're specific about the lines, they're also clear about what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the author should explain the term \"sufficient.\" Is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is suggesting a specific action, but they're not providing any evidence or reasoning why the author should do that. They're just pointing out that the term is vague. So, there's no justification or support given, making it **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking the author to clarify a specific part of their work. While this is helpful in that it provides feedback, it's quite vague. The reviewer doesn't specify what exactly is wrong or how to improve it. Without more detailed suggestions, the authors might not know how to proceed. So, this is **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it's helpful but lacks depth.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the method reduces computation time by using ancestral graphs instead of DAGs. It asks how much information of a DAG is encoded in its ancestral graph. The action here is clear: the authors need to compare the information encoded in both structures. However, the instructions say that explicit actions are better. This is more of a clarifying question rather than a direct action. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat explicit but vague on how to perform the comparison.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific terms like ancestral graphs and DAGs, clearly pointing to the parts of the paper. It also asks a question about information encoding, which is specific. So, this should be fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the method reduces information by using ancestral graphs. The justification is that it's a trade-off for better performance. However, it's vague on how this trade-off is proven or supported. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided. So, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks key elements.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific methodological choice and its implications. It's helpful in that it highlights a potential area for discussion, but it's somewhat vague and doesn't provide clear guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. A 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the author's VAD description is puzzling and points out that the paper discards TF bins with magnitude less than epsilon. It suggests that this isn't a VAD because it's just discarding zero-magnitude bins, which could lead to division by zero. The reviewer then offers an explicit action: \"I would suggest modifying the VAD description to more accurately reflect the presence of speech rather than just discarding bins.\" This is clear and direct, so it's explicit. The action is also concrete because it tells the author exactly what to do. So, this should be a high score on actionability, probably a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about VAD, mentions that it's supposed to look for speech presence, and states that it's usually over time, not frequency. This clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being discussed\u2014the VAD method. The reviewer isn't just making a general comment; they're pinpointing exactly where the issue lies. So, this is fully grounded because it accurately references the paper's section. The specificity is also good because it explains why the method is flawed. Therefore, grounding_specificity should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer's claim is that the author's method isn't a VAD because it discards zero bins. The reviewer supports this with logical reasoning about what VAD entails and references common knowledge about VAD being time-based. This provides clear justification, so the claim is well-supported. It's thorough enough to be a 5, but maybe it's a bit detailed, so perhaps a 4? Wait, no, the reasoning is solid, so it should still be 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a clear issue, suggesting a specific fix, and providing logical reasoning. It's actionable and gives the author a clear direction to improve their work. This makes it highly helpful, so a 5 seems appropriate.\n\nI think all four aspects are highly actionable, grounded, verifiable, and helpful.

It asks if the comparison is fair and requests KID/FID metrics. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The comment suggests an action (improvement) but doesn't specify how or why. It's vague because it doesn't provide details on the comparison's fairness or the metrics. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe it's borderline because it hints at an action but lacks specifics. I think it should be a 1 because it's unclear.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to training networks but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this pertains to. It's too vague. The grounding is weak because it can't confidently identify the referenced part. Specificity is also low since it doesn't detail what's wrong or how to fix it. So, it's weakly grounded and not specific. That would be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that simultaneous training improves performance and then asking for metrics. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. The claim is unsupported, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is somewhat helpful because it does suggest an improvement and asks for metrics, which is a form of feedback.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the contribution is incremental and that the pipeline isn't impressive or novel, just a pack of tricks. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving them a clear action. That means it's not actionable because there's no direct suggestion on how to improve. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the pipeline isn't impressive and suggests it's just tricks for defense evaluation. It doesn't specify which part of the paper is affected or why it's an issue. It's too vague about pinpointing the exact problem. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the contribution is incremental and the pipeline isn't novel. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a general statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to support the claim. That gives it a 1 on verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some feedback by pointing out that the work isn't novel and suggests it's just tricks. However, it doesn't provide specific actionable steps or detailed explanations. It's somewhat vague and lacks depth, so while it's helpful, it's not highly so. I'd rate this as 3 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat helpful but lacks in providing clear actions, grounding, and verifiable evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It is not clear why eta_ri term is non-central chi-squared distribution.\" The action here is pointing out that the term's distribution isn't clear. But it doesn't suggest any specific changes or how to address this. It's more of a question than a suggestion. So, it's not explicit or actionable. It lacks detail on how to fix it. I think this is **1: Unactionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the \"eta_ri term\" and mentions the \"non-central chi-squared distribution.\" It's specific about the part of the paper being discussed, so that's good. However, it doesn't explain what's wrong with the distribution or why it's an issue. It's specific about the part but not about the problem. So, I'd say it's **1: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because it doesn't delve into the specifics of the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a statement that something is unclear, but it doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just a judgment without supporting references or reasoning. So, it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a lack of clarity but doesn't offer any suggestions or explanations. It's more of a criticism without constructive help. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify an issue but doesn't improve the situation for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the reinforcement learning/agent analogy is out-of-place and suggests generalization capabilities better shown through examples later. It also points out that the literature on SNLI is relevant. I think the comment is explicit because it clearly states the issue and the suggestion. But is it concrete? The comment does suggest looking at specific examples, which gives the authors a clear direction. So I'd say this is highly actionable because it tells them exactly what to do without leaving room for interpretation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the literature on SNLI and specific sections of the paper. It mentions lines 229 to 253, which are specific parts. So the comment accurately points to the relevant sections, meaning it's fully grounded. Additionally, it clearly explains why the analogy is out-of-place and what examples to use, making it specific about the issues.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment includes a reference to the SNLI leaderboard, which is a specific external source. It also explains why the analogy is out-of-place and suggests looking at specific examples. The justification is clear and provides enough evidence for the authors to understand the reasoning. So this should be fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues and provides actionable suggestions. It mentions both the literature and specific sections of the paper, which are directly relevant. The feedback is clear and guides the authors on what to improve. While it could be expanded a bit, it's already quite helpful. So I'd rate this as mostly helpful because it's clear and constructive without needing major additions.\n\nOverall, each aspect seems to be at a high level, providing clear and useful feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the method isn't well-positioned in literature and points out some known techniques. It suggests a thorough literature review but doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done. So, the action is explicit\u2014pointing out a known method\u2014but the details on how to apply this are vague. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to some known techniques by name, like score-interpolation, but it's a bit vague. It doesn't clearly pinpoint where exactly the method falls short or how it should be improved. So, the grounding isn't fully specific. I think a 3 here because it's not entirely clear but still mentions specific elements.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review does provide some references, which is good. However, the explanation is a bit brief and doesn't go into depth about why the method is similar to these techniques. It lacks some justification or examples, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd give it a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is informative and points out relevant literature, which is helpful. It suggests a literature review, which is a good direction for the authors. While it's not super detailed, it's still quite useful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that L106 seems to carelessly resolve a debate and asks why the distribution might have changed. It also suggests experiments to disentangle changes in distribution from the removal of information. The action here is clear: the reviewer is pointing out a potential issue and suggesting experiments. However, the instructions for actionability mention that explicit actions are direct, while implicit ones need to be inferred. In this case, the reviewer does suggest experiments, which is a direct action. But the action is vague because it doesn't specify exactly which experiments or how to conduct them. So, it's not fully actionable. Therefore, I'd rate this as **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about the distribution changing and suggests experiments. They don't explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures of the paper. They refer to the distribution in a general sense and suggest experiments without pointing to particular parts. So, the grounding is weak because the reviewer can't confidently identify which part of the paper is being addressed. However, they do specify what needs to be addressed, which is the experiments. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer's claim is that the distribution might have changed and that experiments are needed. They don't provide any supporting evidence or references. The suggestion is vague and lacks justification. Therefore, it's not fully verifiable. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because they do suggest experiments, but without any backing, it's not very solid.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is asking for more experiments and suggesting a direction. While it's a helpful prompt, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete guidance. It gives the authors something to think about but doesn't fully guide them. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does provide some direction but lacks depth.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Though this is not necessary, I'm curious about the performance of the SOTA method (e.g. LST) combined with the adaptive metric.\" Hmm, the reviewer is expressing curiosity but doesn't specify what needs to be done. They're not giving any actionable suggestions. So, there's no explicit or implicit action here. The reviewer isn't telling the authors what to fix or improve. Therefore, this is unactionable. So, actionability score is 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions the SOTA method, like LST, and an adaptive metric. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper or method they're referring to. The reviewer is just giving an example without pointing out a specific issue. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly what's being discussed. Hence, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a statement about the SOTA method and adaptive metric. It's not a claim that needs verification because it's just an opinion or curiosity. There's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. So, it's unverifiable. Verifiability score is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking a question about specific methods but isn't providing any actionable feedback or suggestions. They're not helping the authors improve their work; they're just inquiring about something. So, this isn't helpful at all. Helpfulness score is 1.\n\nOverall, the review point doesn't provide any actionable or specific feedback, so all four aspects are scored as 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

For example, it mentions \"make the plots clearer\" but does not specify actions like increasing font size, adjusting color schemes, or improving axis labels.  \n   - Therefore, it is **Somewhat Actionable** (3).  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - The review points out specific problems with the plots, such as the size, color differences, and labeling issues.  \n   - It clearly identifies the parts of the paper being addressed (the plots) and explains what needs to be fixed.  \n   - The specificity is high because it directly relates to the visual elements of the plots and their impact on clarity.  \n   - Therefore, it is **Fully Grounded and Specific** (5).  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   - The review contains a claim that the plots are unclear and lack proper labeling.  \n   - The justification provided is vague and does not reference external sources or logical reasoning.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The performance gains are not very high, more most of the metrics the different between the baseline (w/o caption + w/o warmup) and best approach (with caption + warmup) is less than 1%.\" Hmm, this is pointing out a problem but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's more of a statement than a suggestion. So, the authors don't know what changes to make. That makes it unactionable because there's no clear direction for improvement. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions metrics and specific changes like adding captions and warmup, but it doesn't tie these to a particular part of the paper. It's too vague about which sections or aspects are affected. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review states that the performance gains are not high, but it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. There's no reference to external studies or common knowledge to support this observation. So, it's not verifiable. That gives it a 1 in verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem but doesn't offer specific suggestions or explain why the performance gains are low. It lacks actionable advice, so the authors don't know what steps to take. This makes it not very helpful. So, helpfulness is a 1 as well.\n\nOverall, the review is quite vague and doesn't provide clear, actionable feedback, which is why all four aspects are rated as 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that using a better Unary baseline might negate the performance boost from adding more parameters. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They might need to consider alternative approaches or further experiments. So, it's not fully actionable because the action isn't clearly stated. I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat actionable but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific models like LinearTop, NLTop, and Unary, and references a specific paper [14]. It clearly points out the issue without making broad claims. So, this has strong grounding because it accurately identifies the parts of the paper being discussed. I'll give it a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review cites a specific paper and provides a rationale for why the Unary baseline might be better. This adds credibility and logical reasoning, making the claim verifiable. It's somewhat detailed but not perfect. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it's somewhat verifiable but could be clearer.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises a valid concern about the Unary baseline, which could help the authors improve their model. However, it's somewhat vague and doesn't provide a clear solution. It's helpful but not the most detailed. So, a 3 seems right here as well.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review provides clear, specific, and justifiable feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a more detailed discussion of related work. It says, \"As the available space allows it, the paper would benefit from...\" So, the action is clear: add a more detailed related work section. But the instruction is a bit vague. It doesn't specify how much more detailed or where exactly to add it. It just says \"not only describing the related works, but also discussing the differences to the presented work.\" That part is a bit unclear. So, it's explicit that an action is needed, but the specifics are missing. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but the details are lacking.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions related work but doesn't tie it directly to the paper's sections or unique aspects. It's a general suggestion without pinpointing where exactly the related work should be expanded. So, the grounding is weak because it's not specific about the part of the paper. The specificity is also lacking because it doesn't clearly explain what needs to be addressed in the related work section. Therefore, this is **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not specific enough, but it does identify the area somewhat.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion to add more related work discussion. There's no claim here; it's just a recommendation. It doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why adding this would be beneficial. So, it's a normal statement without a claim, which means it's **X: No Claim**. Therefore, verifiability isn't applicable here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review suggests adding a related work section but doesn't specify how this will improve the paper or provide examples. It's vague and doesn't give the authors clear guidance on what to do. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very detailed or actionable.

But it doesn't specify how to implement it, like suggesting specific models or methods. So it's not fully actionable because the details are missing. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions other tasks and architectures but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It appears that the output from the algorithm depends on the order in which the data are processed. This should be clarified.\" The key here is whether this comment gives the authors a clear action to take. The comment mentions that the output depends on data order but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. They might need to clarify this themselves or look into why the order affects the output. Since the action isn't explicitly stated, it's a bit vague. So, I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does mention an action but doesn't tell them exactly how to proceed. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the algorithm's output depending on data order. It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a particular section or figure. It's more of a general statement without pinpointing the issue. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. Therefore, this should be a \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" score, which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the output depends on data order. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. It's just stating an observation without supporting it with references or logical reasoning. So, it's not verifiable. I'll rate this as 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a potential issue with the algorithm's output but doesn't offer specific suggestions on how to address it. It's clear that the authors need to clarify this, but the review doesn't give them a roadmap on how to do that. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully constructive. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 3, grounding_specificity: 3, verifiability: 1, and helpfulness: 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out several areas for improvement, like the logic comparison with [9] and [16], computational cost, and a lack of discussion. It does give clear directions on what to improve, so that's explicit. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement these changes or what specific modifications are needed. It's somewhat vague on the actions, so I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific references like [9] and [16], which grounds the feedback in the paper. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, like the logic and computational cost. Since it accurately points to these parts without needing more information, it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the comparison between the proposed method and the references, but it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's vague and lacks justification, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the areas needing improvement and provides some suggestions, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into detail about how to fix these issues or why the computational cost is a big issue. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed, so I rate it **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using tabular data but doesn't specify how to implement it. It's vague about the actions the authors should take. So, it's not explicit because it doesn't tell them exactly what to do. It's also not concrete because it doesn't provide details on how to apply the suggestion. Therefore, it's somewhere between 2 and 3. Since it's vague and lacks detail, I think it's a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about tabular data but doesn't reference any specific part of the paper. It's too general, so the authors can't pinpoint where to focus. This means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the section or aspect being addressed. So, it's a 3 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claims or suggestions. It's just an opinion or suggestion without supporting evidence. There's no logical reasoning or references provided, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment offers a suggestion but it's too vague. The authors don't know how to apply it or why it's important. It lacks clarity and depth, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"More details on using attention would be useful, perhaps as an extra appendix.\" I need to check if this is explicit or implicit. It seems like the reviewer is suggesting adding more details, which is an explicit action. But is it vague? The reviewer doesn't specify how to add these details or where exactly in the paper they should go. So, it's explicit but vague. According to the scale, that would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment is about adding more details on using attention. It doesn't mention a specific part of the paper or where exactly these details should be placed. It's a general suggestion, so the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't pinpoint the section. So, this would be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It's just recommending something but not backing it up with references or logical reasoning. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is suggesting adding more details as an appendix. It's helpful because it points out an area for improvement, but it's vague. The authors know they need more details but don't know how to implement it. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review asks the authors why they only tested Gaussian noise. It's a direct question, so it's explicit. But it doesn't tell them exactly what to do next. The authors might need to consider other noise types or collect more data. So, it's not fully actionable because the implementation part isn't clear. I think this is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"images corrupted using Gaussian noise\" which is specific. It clearly points to a part of the paper, so grounding is good. It's not vague or too broad. I'd give this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the authors need to address why only Gaussian noise was used. It doesn't provide evidence or reasoning, so it's not fully verifiable. It's more of a question than a claim with support. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and points to a specific issue. It's helpful because it guides the authors to consider other noise types. It's not the most detailed, but it's useful. So, a 3 makes sense.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the full depth needed for maximum impact.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says, \"Regarding the empirical version of the objective (3), it might be appropriate to put it in the supplementary materials.\" I need to check if this is explicit or implicit. The comment is suggesting where to place the empirical version, which is a direct action. It doesn't ask for clarification but clearly states what should be done. Now, is it concrete? It tells the authors exactly where to put it, so yes, it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a high score. But looking at the scale, 5 is the highest, but the comment is clear and direct, so maybe 4? Wait, the user's initial response said 3. Hmm, maybe because it's not super detailed on how to implement it, just suggests putting it in supplementary materials. So, perhaps it's somewhat actionable but not fully concrete. So, 3 makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"the empirical version of the objective (3)\" and mentions \"putting it in the supplementary materials.\" It's explicitly pointing to a specific part of the paper, so that's full grounding. Then, it specifies what needs to be done, which is putting it in supplementary materials. So, it's both grounded and specific. Therefore, this should be a 5. But the initial response was 3. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the comment is a bit vague about why it's appropriate. It doesn't explain the reasoning behind putting it in supplementary materials. So, while it's grounded, the specificity about why might be lacking. So, maybe it's weakly grounded and specific, hence 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it suggests a change in the paper. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just says it might be appropriate. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's unverifiable. Therefore, it should be 1. The initial response was 1, which matches.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear and suggests a specific change, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any rationale or further guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. Therefore, a 3 seems appropriate. The initial response was 3, which aligns.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores should be actionability:3, grounding_specificity:3, verifiability:1, helpfulness:3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It's pretty explicit, so that's good. It tells the authors exactly what to do. But it doesn't give any specifics on how to calculate the division or any potential issues, which might make it a bit vague. However, since it's clear what needs to be done, I think it's actionable.

It doesn't just say \"add more details,\" it specifies what exactly to add. So the authors can pinpoint where to make the changes. This means it's well-grounded. Also, it's clear what needs to be addressed, so it's specific. I'd give this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting adding details but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is necessary. It's just a request without supporting reasoning. So it's not verifiable. I'll rate this as 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and directly points out what needs to be added. It's actionable and gives the authors a clear direction. While it doesn't go into how to implement it, it's still helpful because it identifies the areas for improvement.

The comment suggests looking into other tasks, which gives a clear direction for the authors to improve their model. So, it's explicit and provides a direct action, but it doesn't specify exactly what to do beyond exploring other tasks. That makes it somewhat actionable. So, I'll rate it as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Task 1, which is specific. It doesn't go into why Task 1 was chosen or what might be missing in other tasks. So, the grounding is clear, but the specificity about what's missing isn't detailed. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and somewhat specific, which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that Task 1 is insufficient.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the dataset is small and suggests testing on medium or large datasets like ImageNet. The action here is suggesting a change, which is explicit. However, the review doesn't provide concrete steps on how to implement this suggestion, like which experiments to run or how to compare the results. So, it's explicit but lacks detail, making it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"medium or even large dataset\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly this change should be applied. It's vague about the specific aspect of the paper being addressed. Therefore, the grounding is weak because it can't be precisely identified. This gives it a **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** score.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that a larger dataset would make the results more convincing. It suggests an improvement but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references.

So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully, making it a **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a minor issue and offers a constructive suggestion. It's clear and actionable, providing the authors with something to improve their work.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the S1DB-ED algorithm is too similar to RMED and suggests a need for discussion on the comparison. It's explicit about the action, which is to discuss the comparison. However, it doesn't provide specific details on how to do that, like suggesting a particular analysis or metrics. So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the details are vague. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to RMED by citation, which grounds it by mentioning a specific work. It also clearly states the issue, which is the similarity, and suggests a specific area for improvement, the comparison. There's no mention of external examples, so it's not highly specific, but it's grounded because it references a specific paper and the issue is clear. So, it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the novelty is limited because of similarity. It's supported by the citation to RMED, which is a well-known work, making the justification clear and logical. There's no need for external references beyond what's already provided. So, it's **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and suggests an improvement, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that GCG's approach can be transferred to other LLMs and suggests including such a comparison. It also points out that the jailbreaking percentage is low for certain LLMs. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The review does suggest specific actions, like including a comparison and noting the jailbreaking percentage. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement these actions, like providing examples or suggesting a particular method. So, it's explicit in pointing out actions but not concrete in how to do them. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about GCG's approach and mentions other LLMs, which is good for grounding. It also points out the jailbreaking percentage, which is a specific part of the paper. However, the comment is a bit vague about what exactly needs to be included in the comparison. It doesn't specify whether it's about performance metrics or just mentioning the possibility. So, while it's grounded, the specificity about what needs to be addressed is a bit lacking. That would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that GCG's approach can be transferred, which is a judgment. It supports this by stating that the jailbreaking percentage is low, which is a reference to external knowledge. However, the explanation is a bit vague. It mentions the possibility of transfer but doesn't provide concrete evidence or examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. That would be **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides some suggestions but doesn't go into much detail. It mentions including a comparison and notes the jailbreaking percentage, which gives the authors something to work on. However, it's quite brief and doesn't offer extensive guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not entirely. That would be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think each aspect is a 3 because they all fall into the middle of the scale. They provide some value but aren't as strong as a 4 or 5. There's room for improvement in being more specific, providing clearer actions, and offering more detailed verifications.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review asks if the unified framework can handle any general POMDP formulations, including continuous or infinite spaces. It's a good question, but it's more of a clarifying question. The reviewer isn't explicitly telling the authors what to do next. They're just pointing out a potential limitation. So, it's not giving a direct action or suggestion. That makes it borderline actionable because it's implicit, but vague. So, I'd give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions POMDP formalisms but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. They're talking about limitations in general, not pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the referenced part. However, they do specify what needs to be addressed, which is the limitations in handling continuous or infinite spaces. That makes it somewhat grounded but not fully. So, a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the unified framework can't handle all POMDP formulations. But they don't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question rather than providing a suggestion. It doesn't give the authors a clear direction on how to improve their work. It's vague and doesn't offer actionable feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. Maybe a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own score based on how well the review point meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the dataset creation is optional and mentions Kialo's dataset as a better option. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next, like suggesting an alternative or explaining why Kialo's dataset is better. So, it's not giving a clear action, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this falls under a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Kialo's dataset as a specific example but doesn't clearly state which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a bit vague about how this dataset relates to the authors' work. So, it's not fully grounded, maybe a 3 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions Kialo's dataset is well-studied and cleaner. It provides some reasoning but doesn't cite any external references or give a clear justification beyond stating it's better. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully, probably a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a comparison and suggests an alternative dataset, which is helpful. It gives the authors something to consider but doesn't go into depth or provide specific fixes. So, it's somewhat helpful, maybe a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is moderately addressed, so a 3 seems appropriate for all.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the number of tasks is limited and suggests seeing several tasks (at least 10) and sequential results. It also asks for more detailed feedback. The action here is clear: authors should add more tasks and provide sequential results. The instructions are explicit, so that's good. However, the review doesn't specify exactly how to implement this, like whether they should compare with other studies or what metrics to use. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to tasks and sequential results but doesn't specify which part of the paper or unique aspects. It's a bit vague. The grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or unique element. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests improvements but doesn't provide any evidence or references. It's just a request for more tasks and results. There's no logical reasoning or external sources, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the weaknesses and provides specific questions for the authors. It's helpful because it guides them on what to improve. However, it doesn't offer much beyond that, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. That makes it **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think each aspect is a 3 because they're all moderately clear but lack some depth or specificity.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the motivation for analyzing only the last convolutional layer isn't clear. It asks why numerosity isn't present in earlier layers. The comment is explicit about the lack of clarity, which is an action. However, it doesn't provide any specific steps or details on how to address this. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what to do next. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the last convolutional layer but doesn't specify why it's important or what exactly is missing in earlier layers. It's vague about the specific part of the paper and what needs fixing. So, it's not fully grounded because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. That would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that there's a reason for analyzing only the last layer, but it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this. It's just a statement without justification, so it's **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest an area for improvement by pointing out a lack of clarity, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer specific solutions or further explanation, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That makes it **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Each aspect has its own criteria and scale from 1 to 5. \n\nLet me start by understanding each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:** This aspect assesses whether the review point gives clear instructions or suggestions. It's divided into explicit vs. implicit and concrete vs. vague. Explicit means the reviewer directly tells the author what to do, while implicit requires the author to infer. Concrete is when the action is clear, and vague is when it's not. \n\nLooking at the review point, it says \"How to set the parameter S remains a problem.\" It mentions that setting S is a problem but doesn't specify what needs to be done. So, it's not giving an explicit instruction on how to set S. Therefore, it's implicit. Since it's implicit, it's probably vague because it doesn't provide any concrete steps or guidance. So, this would score low on actionability.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:** This looks at how specific the review point is regarding the paper. It's divided into grounding (whether the part of the paper is clearly identified) and specificity (how clear the issue is). \n\nThe review point doesn't mention any specific part of the paper or the parameter S. It just states that setting S is a problem. So, the reviewer isn't pinpointing where exactly the issue is. Therefore, grounding is weak because it can't accurately identify the referenced part. Since it's not grounded, it doesn't meet the higher criteria for specificity either. So, this would score low on grounding_specificity.\n\n**Verifiability:** This aspect checks if the review point contains a claim and how well it's supported. The review point is stating that setting S is a problem, which is a judgment or opinion. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. So, it's a claim without support, making it unverifiable. Therefore, this would score low on verifiability.\n\n**Helpfulness:** This is a subjective score based on how useful the review point is. The review point points out an issue (parameter S is problematic) but doesn't suggest any solutions or specify what needs to be done. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable feedback. Without clear guidance, the authors won't know how to improve their work. So, it's not very helpful. It might be helpful in identifying a problem but lacks the depth needed for improvement. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful but not highly so.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 1 because they all fall into the lower categories. The review point is not actionable, not grounded, not verifiable, and only somewhat helpful because it identifies a problem but doesn't provide solutions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

This provides a clear action for the authors to take, making it actionable. However, the explanation is somewhat vague, as it doesn't provide specific guidance on how to choose or tune these hyperparameters. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - The comment mentions specific constraints (convex/concave, increasing/decreasing) and explains their choice as a hyperparameter. This clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed and specifies what needs improvement. It's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because while it's specific, it doesn't explicitly name the section or table.\n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   - The claim is that choosing these constraints is a hyperparameter needing tuning. This is supported by the technical nature of the statement and the implication that it's a common practice in machine learning. It's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** as it's clear but lacks specific references or examples.\n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   - The review provides a clear point that tuning is necessary but doesn't offer specific advice on how to do it.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that bias benchmarks only assess gender, race, and religion. It also points out missing assessments on state-of-the-art models like GPT. I think the authors can take action here by expanding their evaluations to include more biases and models. The review is explicit about what needs to be done, so that's good. But it doesn't specify exactly how to implement this, like whether they should add new datasets or modify their existing ones. So it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete steps. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review clearly states which parts of the paper are affected\u2014specifically, the bias benchmarks. It doesn't make any vague claims about the paper as a whole. The grounding is strong because it accurately points out the specific areas lacking. However, it could provide more detail on what exactly is missing, like mentioning specific metrics or examples, but that's not required for grounding. So I'd give this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions existing biases and datasets but also points out missing ones, including state-of-the-art models. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support these claims. It's clear that the authors need to add these, but without justification or evidence, it's not very verifiable. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out specific shortcomings and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into detail about how to implement these changes or why these areas are critical. It's somewhat helpful but could be more comprehensive. I'd rate this a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It seems like the reviewer is pointing out problems but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. The authors would need to infer how to improve the figure themselves. This is explicit but vague, so I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Figure 3 by name, which is specific. It also mentions specific issues like workflow and captions, so the authors know exactly which part to focus on. This seems like **3: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it's clear and points directly to the figure.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why Figure 3 is problematic. It just states the issues without backing them up. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment identifies issues but doesn't offer solutions or suggest improvements.

The review is encouraging the authors to do specific things but doesn't provide examples or references, which affects verifiability. Actionability is there but not fully detailed.

Hmm, so the reviewer is pointing out a problem, but does this give the authors clear steps to fix it? It just mentions that the approach isn't NLP-specific, which is a problem, but it doesn't suggest what changes to make. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of a general statement, so I'd say it's not actionable. Maybe a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer says the authors claim it's NLP-specific but isn't. But does the review pinpoint exactly where the issue is? It just says \"nothing NLP-specific,\" which is vague. The authors might not know what part is missing. So, the grounding isn't specific because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or element.

Maybe a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements. It's a critique without actionable advice. So, it's not very helpful.

It suggests looking into references, which provides some justification but isn't very detailed. There's a logical reasoning component, but it's not robust or specific enough. So, this falls under **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but lacks depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a lack of clarity and suggests looking into references, which is helpful. However, it's not very detailed and doesn't provide concrete steps or examples. It's somewhat helpful but could be more so. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does offer some guidance but isn't comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the specific points made in the review.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that Section 3.1 deals with 3D Gaussians and follows previous work. It asks the author to correct if there's any additional novel effort. The action here is to correct the statement, but it's vague. The author isn't told exactly what to change or how to improve it. So, it's not explicit because it's more of a question than a clear instruction. It's also not concrete because it doesn't specify what the additional effort could be. So, this should be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Section 3.1 by name, which is specific. It doesn't make any general comments, so the grounding is clear. The specificity is also good because it directly points out the section and asks about additional effort. There's no mention of external work, so that part isn't an issue. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that Section 3.1 follows previous work. The justification is vague\u2014it just says \"follows the previous work\" without providing evidence or references. There's no logical reasoning or external sources cited, so it's not fully verifiable. It's more of a general statement without support, so this would be **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific section and asking a question, but it's quite brief. It doesn't provide much guidance on what exactly needs to be corrected or how to improve the section. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The first paragraph of the Introduction is entirely devoted to a general introduction of DNNs, without any mention of drift. Given that the paper's core focus is on detecting drift types and drift magnitude, I believe the DNN-related introduction is not central to this paper, and this entire paragraph provides little valuable information to readers.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests presenting a simplified version of Theorem 2 for the general audience. It's explicit about the action, which is to simplify the theorem. However, it doesn't provide concrete steps on how to do this. So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the method is vague. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** (3).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Theorem 2 by name, which is specific. It doesn't mention any external references or other parts of the paper, so it's fully grounded. But it doesn't specify what exactly needs to be simplified or how. So, it's **Fully Grounded and Specific** (5) in terms of referencing, but since it doesn't detail the simplification, maybe it's still 5 because it does ground the comment.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion without any justification or evidence. It's just recommending a change without supporting why it's a good idea or how it would help. So, it's **Unverifiable** (1).\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear about suggesting a simplification, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any rationale or examples, making it somewhat vague. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful** (3).\n\nI think that's a solid breakdown. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, considering explicitness, grounding, verifiability, and overall usefulness to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using a larger resolution, which is a clear action. But it doesn't specify how to implement it, like whether it's a minor or major change. So it's explicit but vague. That should be a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about experiments with a specific resolution but doesn't mention the part of the paper or any unique elements. It's a bit vague, so it's weakly grounded. Since it's not fully pinpointing the issue, it's a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the suggestion is to test performance with larger images, but there's no supporting evidence or justification. It's just a vague recommendation without backing, so it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is useful because it suggests an improvement, but it's vague. It doesn't provide specific guidance on how to adjust the resolution or what results to expect. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully, making it a 3.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring I'm consistent with the criteria.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Might want to mention that these algorithms follow the sampled policy for awhile.\" The first thing I notice is that it's suggesting an improvement, but it's pretty vague. It doesn't specify what exactly needs to be mentioned or how to do it. So, it's not giving a clear action. That makes me think it's not fully actionable. Maybe it's a bit better than unactionable, but still not explicit. So, I'd rate it as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is about the paper. The comment here is about algorithms following a policy, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It's too vague. The authors might not know exactly where to look or what to mention. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't pinpoint the issue. I'd give it a 3 here as well.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a suggestion, so it's a claim. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It just says \"might want to mention\" without explaining why or how. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. I'd rate this as 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does suggest an improvement, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide much direction. The authors might not know exactly what to do or how to implement the suggestion. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully detailed or comprehensive. I'd rate this as 3 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the specifics of the review point. The scores reflect the clarity, specificity, verifiability, and overall helpfulness of the comment.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Additional experiments on larger data sets would be nice (but I understand that compute might be an issue).\" I think the action here is suggesting more experiments, which is explicit. But the reviewer also mentions understanding about compute, which is more of an implicit action. So, it's not fully explicit. The suggestion is clear, but the implicit part about understanding makes it somewhat actionable. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about larger data sets but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly these experiments should be added. They also mention compute, which is more general. So, the grounding isn't very specific. They could have pointed to a specific section or figure, but they didn't. Therefore, this is weakly grounded and not specific, which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer suggests adding experiments but doesn't provide any justification or references. They just mention it's nice and acknowledge compute limitations. There's no supporting evidence, so this is unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer offers a suggestion but it's vague. They mention larger data sets and compute, but without specifics. It's helpful in that it suggests an improvement, but it's not detailed enough. So, it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated based on how well the review provides clear, specific, and justifiable suggestions to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"While I understand the space limitations, I think the paper could greatly benefit from more explanation of the meaning of the bounds (perhaps in the appendix).\" The comment suggests adding more explanation, which is an explicit action. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to add it or where, just mentions an appendix. So it's explicit but vague. That should be a 3 because it's not fully actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"more explanation of the meaning of the bounds\" and mentions an appendix. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed, so that's full grounding. It also specifies what needs to be added, which is specific. So this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It just recommends adding something, so there's no justification provided. That makes it unverifiable, so a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment offers a suggestion but doesn't explain why it's beneficial or how it helps the authors improve. It's vague and lacks depth, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That would be a 3.\n\nSo putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that having 5, 6, and 4 datasets for three tasks might not be enough for a rigorous evaluation, especially if some datasets are too large. It also thanks the authors for their reply, provides a repository, and clarifies that datasets are novel. The motivations for the dataset numbers are given, and the author updated their assessment. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review does suggest that the number of datasets might be insufficient, which is an explicit action. However, it's vague on how the authors should proceed, like whether they need to collect more data or what specific changes to make. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. That would be a 4 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about datasets and tasks but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It mentions the number of datasets but doesn't tie it directly to the methodology or findings. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or issue. The specificity about why the dataset sizes are chosen is there, but it's not tied to a particular part of the paper. So, this would be a 3 because it's weakly grounded but somewhat specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides some reasoning about dataset sizes and mentions a repository, which is a form of external reference. However, the justification is a bit vague. It explains why the dataset numbers might be insufficient but doesn't go into detailed examples or further references. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. That would be a 3 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers feedback on the dataset selection and provides a repository, which is helpful. It acknowledges the authors' reply and clarifies their position, which adds value. However, the feedback is somewhat incomplete because it doesn't address other potential issues or provide more detailed suggestions. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the highest. That would be a 4 on the helpfulness scale.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that there are no results with larger models like ResNet101/152. It suggests that this is a limitation. Now, is this an explicit or implicit action? The comment is pointing out a problem but doesn't tell the authors what to do next. It doesn't specify adding results or suggesting why larger models aren't used. So, it's implicit. Since it's implicit, the authors still don't know how to apply this feedback. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about ResNet50/34/18 performing well but not larger models. It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a particular section or figure. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. But it does mention what's missing, which is specific enough. So, I think this is weakly grounded and specific, giving it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that there are no results with larger models. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a claim without support. So, it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't suggest any improvements. It just states that larger models weren't tested. While it's relevant, it doesn't guide the authors on what to do next. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nOverall, the review is pointing out a problem but lacks specific guidance and justification, making it somewhat helpful but not highly so.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the method doesn't support well in practice and suggests trying a dense reward instead. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement the change. They might not know if just switching to a dense reward is enough or if more steps are needed. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. I think this is a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but not fully concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about sub-task-specific rewards and compares it to dense rewards. It mentions specific parts like Qmix, which shows it's trying to pinpoint where the issue lies. However, the explanation is a bit vague about why sub-task rewards might not work as well. It doesn't clearly specify the exact part of the paper being addressed, so I'd rate this a 3 as well. It's weakly grounded but tries to be specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that switching to a dense reward might solve the sparse-reward tasks. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's just a suggestion without backing, so it's not verifiable. I think this is a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some suggestions but doesn't go into much detail. It's clear that the method doesn't support well, but it doesn't elaborate on why or how to fix it. The suggestions are present but not very helpful overall. I'd rate this a 3 as well because it's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nSo, each aspect is a 3 because they're all somewhat present but lack the depth or detail needed to be fully actionable, grounded, verifiable, or helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper has some confusing mistakes in the proof and lacks detailed discussion and comparison with previous work. It also states that the paper didn't give any new insight. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. \n\nIn this case, the reviewer points out specific issues but doesn't tell the authors exactly how to fix them. They mention mistakes in the proof but don't suggest corrections. Similarly, they talk about the lack of discussion and comparison but don't provide guidance on how to add that. So, it's more of an implicit suggestion rather than explicit. Since the actions aren't clearly defined, it's not highly actionable. It might be somewhat actionable if they had suggested specific edits, but since they didn't, I'd rate it as 1, which is unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review mentions the proof mistakes, lack of discussion, and no new insights. However, it's quite vague. The authors don't know exactly which section to focus on or what specific changes to make. It's not fully grounded because it's too broad. So, it's weakly grounded and not specific, which would be a 3 on the scale.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims like \"the paper lacks a detailed discussion\" and \"no new insight.\" These are opinions. Now, checking if these claims are supported. The reviewer doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back up these claims. They're just stating observations without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out some issues, but it's quite vague. It mentions mistakes, lack of discussion, and no new insights but doesn't provide clear guidance on how to fix them. The feedback is somewhat general, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very detailed or actionable.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the motivation is unclear and mentions the use of CAT and GAN, but it doesn't explain why these are needed or how they improve the model. It also talks about unfair comparison but doesn't suggest how to fix it. So, the action is implicit because the reviewer is pointing out issues but not giving clear steps on what to do. Therefore, it's borderline actionable, which is a 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the adversarial network and the new additions like CAT and GAN but doesn't specify exactly where in the paper these should be addressed. It's vague about which part of the paper needs improvement. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact section. But it does explain what's wrong, so it's somewhat specific. That makes it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that the motivation is unclear and the comparison is unfair. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back these claims. It's just opinions without justification, so it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify some issues but lacks concrete suggestions. It mentions the need for motivation and fair comparison but doesn't offer clear fixes.

The review says, \"No adversarial loss to guarantee the perturbed data being similar to the authentic data.\" I'm trying to see if this gives the authors clear instructions on what to do. It mentions adversarial loss and perturbed data, but it doesn't tell them how to modify their model or data. It's more like a statement of a condition rather than an actionable step. So, it's not explicit or concrete. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about adversarial loss and perturbed data without pointing to a specific part of the paper. It doesn't mention any sections, tables, or figures. So, the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. This means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the part being addressed.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim by suggesting a method to ensure perturbed data is similar to authentic data. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating a practice without explaining why it's beneficial or citing any sources. So, it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is vague and doesn't offer specific advice on how to implement the idea. It doesn't guide the authors on modifying their model or data.

So, it's explicit in suggesting an action but lacks detail on how to implement it. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about comparing with a few methods and the proposed method not being better. It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a particular section or figure. It's making a general comment without pinpointing the issue. So, the grounding is weak because it can't be precisely identified. The specificity about what's wrong isn't clear either. Therefore, it's **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review states that the performance is only compared with a few methods and the proposed isn't better. It doesn't provide any justification or references for why this is an issue. There's no logical reasoning or external sources cited, so it's not verifiable. This falls under **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some suggestions about comparing with methods and the proposed not being better, but it's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or detailed analysis. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the provided review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the article's reasoning is similar to another study, which raises questions about whether it's an extension or has novel contributions. The comment is explicit about pointing out similarities but doesn't specify what changes the authors should make. It's vague on how to address these issues, so it's not actionable. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it does hint at an action but lacks details.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to another study, which is specific, but it doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper is being compared or what exactly is lacking. It's a bit vague in pinpointing the issue, so it's weakly grounded. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly specify the part of the paper being discussed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests that the work is an extension of a previous study but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. There's no justification or references, so it's unverifiable. It doesn't meet even the basic threshold of supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises concerns but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or clarify what needs to be done. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue, but it's incomplete and lacks depth, making it not fully helpful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are 1 for actionability, 3 for grounding_specificity, 1 for verifiability, and 3 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the very-long-term forecasting task is limited in practical significance and suggests improving the discussion by conducting experiments on more datasets and training models with the correct forecast horizon. Now, I need to determine if this is actionable. The comment does provide specific actions like more experiments and correct training, so that's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? It says \"conducing experiments on more datasets\" but doesn't specify how many or which ones. So, it's explicit in stating the action but vague on the details. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the forecasting task's practical significance and suggests improving the discussion. It doesn't mention a specific part of the paper, like a section or figure. It's more general, so the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. However, it does specify what needs to be addressed, which is somewhat specific. So, this would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the task is of limited practical significance and suggests improvements. The suggestion to conduct more experiments and train models with the correct horizon is supported by logical reasoning\u2014more data and proper training would make the results more robust. There's no mention of external references, but the reasoning is clear. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which is **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a weakness in the task's practicality and provides suggestions for improvement. It's clear and actionable, even though it's not perfect. The suggestions are specific enough to guide the authors, so it's helpful but not the highest level. That makes it **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think each aspect is a 3 because they all fall into the middle category. The review isn't perfect, but it's providing useful feedback without being vague or lacking in justification.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors should perform more rigorous analyses but doesn't specify exactly what they should do. It mentions looking into theoretical analyses or experiments but doesn't outline the steps or how to implement this. So, it's explicit in pointing out the action but vague on the details. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but not how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about theoretical analyses and experiments, which are specific areas in the paper. It also mentions comparing different types of predictors, which are specific elements. So, the authors can accurately pinpoint the sections being addressed, and the issues are clearly defined. This should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims about the lack of rigorous analyses but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just states that such analyses are missing without backing it up. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but lacks key elements like examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions for the authors to improve their work by adding more rigorous analyses. It's specific about what needs to be done and provides a direction for improvement. While it could be expanded, it's already quite helpful. So, this should be **Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Actionability is somewhat actionable because it's clear but vague. Grounding is fully grounded and specific because it points to specific parts. Verifiability is somewhat because it lacks evidence. Helpfulness is mostly helpful because it's specific and actionable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The authors do not analyze the security (i.e., protection of the privacy) of the proposed framework.\" Hmm, so it's pointing out that the authors didn't do something. But does it tell the authors what to do? It says they should analyze security, but it doesn't specify how or where. So, it's an implicit action because the authors need to infer it. But since it's not giving any details on how to analyze security, it's vague. So, according to the criteria, this would be borderline actionable because it's implicit and vague. So, I think the actionability label should be 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the security (i.e., protection of the privacy) of the proposed framework.\" It's referring to a specific part of the paper, the security aspect, and explains what it means. So, the authors can identify exactly where the issue is. Also, it's clear what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this is fully grounded and specific. So, the grounding_specificity label should be 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it suggests that the authors didn't analyze security. It needs verification, but the review doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to back this up. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's unverifiable. Therefore, the verifiability label is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a deficiency but doesn't provide any suggestions or improvements. It just states a problem without offering actionable steps. So, it's not helpful at all because the authors don't know what to do next. Hence, the helpfulness label is 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is borderline in terms of actionability, fully grounded and specific, unverifiable, and not helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the multi-scale statement is misleading because the slow and fast RNNs operate on logical time scales, not physical ones. It also mentions that the benefit is reducing the gradient path by the slow RNN. This seems like an explicit action because the reviewer is pointing out a specific issue and providing a clear explanation. However, the explanation is a bit vague about how exactly the logical time scale affects the gradient path. So, it's not super detailed on the implementation, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully concrete. I think this falls under a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions that the slow and fast RNNs operate on logical time scales when the stacks are sequentialized. This is pretty specific because they're pinpointing exactly where the issue lies in the code structure. They're not just saying it's a problem but specifying how it's a problem. So, this should be fully grounded with specific details. I'll give this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer provides a clear explanation of why the multi-scale statement is misleading. They reference logical time scales and how the sequentialization affects the gradient path. This is logical reasoning and specific examples, so it's well-supported. I think this is mostly verifiable, so a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is quite helpful. They clearly identify the issue and suggest a possible improvement by pointing out the benefit of the slow RNN. The explanation is detailed enough to guide the authors on where to look in their code. It's not overly vague, so it's quite helpful. I'll rate this a 4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For actionability, the reviewer did give an explicit action but didn't go into detail on how to fix it. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe it should be a 3. Grounding is definitely 5. Verifiability is solid, so 4. Helpfulness is also solid, so 4. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the invariant learning module focuses on mask selection and raw-level features. It points out that the former framework isn't limited to raw-level selection and mentions a discussion in the appendix about representation learning. The reviewer suggests that the feature selection in Section 4.2 could be improved with consideration of representation learning. \n\nHmm, so the reviewer is giving a suggestion but it's a bit vague. They don't specify exactly what needs to be done or how to implement the improvement. They just say \"could be further improved\" and mention representation learning. That doesn't give the authors a clear action to take. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe it's somewhat actionable because they suggest an improvement, but it's not explicit enough. So, I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about Section 4.2 and mentions the appendix. They specifically point out that the former framework isn't limited to raw-level selection, which is a specific part of the paper. Then they suggest considering representation learning, which is a specific aspect within feature selection. They also reference the appendix, which is a specific section. So, the reviewer is clearly pinpointing the sections and parts being discussed, which means they have full grounding. They also specify what needs to be addressed, which adds to the specificity. So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The reviewer makes a claim that the feature selection in Section 4.2 could be improved with consideration of representation learning. They support this by pointing out that the former framework isn't limited to raw-level selection and that there's a discussion in the appendix. The reasoning is clear, and they provide references to specific sections, which makes it somewhat verifiable. It's not fully verifiable because they don't give a detailed justification or examples, but it's better than unverifiable. So, I'd give this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides a suggestion but it's quite vague. They don't specify how to implement the improvement or provide concrete examples. They just mention that the feature selection could be improved and that representation learning should be considered. While this is helpful in pointing out an area for improvement, it's not very detailed. It could be more helpful if they had suggested specific changes or provided more context. So, I'd rate this as 4 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 3, grounding_specificity: 5, verifiability: 3, and helpfulness: 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It could be more helpful by offering specific actionable steps or references.  \n\nThe scores are all 1 or 3, which are borderline. However, the review does provide some value, so a 3 is appropriate for helpfulness. The other aspects are either not grounded or not explicit, so they receive a 1.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the Flipped-QA framework is applied only to LLM-based models and suggests verifying it for non-LLM models like HiTeA and InternVideo. The action here is clear: verify the framework's effectiveness and universality. But the review doesn't specify how to do this. It just suggests the verification without providing methods or steps. So, it's an explicit action but lacks detail on how to implement it. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to non-LLM models by name (HiTeA and InternVideo), which means it accurately identifies the specific models. It also mentions verifying the framework's effectiveness, which is clear. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That gives it a **5** for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests verifying the framework's effectiveness but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's vague and lacks justification. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation of the framework and provides a suggestion, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is somewhat vague and doesn't offer specific methods or references. It's clear and actionable enough, so it's **Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Actionability was about the explicitness and concreteness, which I addressed. Grounding was about specific references, which it had.

It doesn't specify what changes to make, so it's explicit but vague. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate it a 3.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the review refers to existing methods by citing papers, which is specific. It also mentions the lack of theoretical novelty, which clearly identifies the part needing improvement. So, it's fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nNext, **verifiability**: The review includes references to specific papers, which are verifiable. However, the suggestion to improve is a bit vague and doesn't provide concrete steps. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which I'll rate as 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides specific references, which is helpful.

It just poses a question, so the authors don't know what to do next. That means it's not actionable because there's no clear direction given. So, it's probably a 1 for unactionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to \"the text input\" and \"four text elements of an object.\" It's a bit vague because it doesn't specify which part of the paper or which elements exactly. The authors might have to guess where to focus, which isn't very helpful. So, this is weakly grounded and not specific, making it a 1.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a question, which doesn't really require evidence or justification. It's more of a factual statement than a claim. Since there's no claim being made, it falls under \"X\" for no claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is just a question without any guidance.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper could do better to first motivate the \"Why\". It's suggesting an action, which is good. But the action is vague. It doesn't tell the author exactly what to do or how to improve the motivation section. So, it's not explicit because it's just a suggestion without details. It's also not concrete because it doesn't specify how to motivate the \"Why\". So, this falls under \"3: Somewhat Actionable\" because it does mention an action but doesn't elaborate.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about motivating the \"Why\", but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be motivated. It's a general suggestion without pointing to a specific section or issue. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint where the problem lies. The specificity is also lacking because it doesn't explain what needs to be done. Therefore, this is \"3: Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it's not clear which part is being addressed, but it does imply something needs improvement.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the paper could do better in motivating the \"Why\". However, there's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. It's an opinion without any justification or references. So, it's not verifiable because it lacks any backing. This would be a \"1: Unverifiable\" score.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review suggests adding a motivation section but doesn't provide specific advice on how to do that. It's vague and doesn't offer actionable steps. While it's somewhat helpful in pointing out a weakness, it doesn't give enough guidance to help the author improve.

They need to add experiments, but the instructions aren't clear on how to implement this. So, it's not explicit because it's suggesting an action without detailing how to do it. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't provide specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"realistic noisy datasets like WebVision.\" WebVision is a known dataset, so the authors can identify it. The comment is specific about the type of dataset, which means it's grounded. It also clearly states what the issue is, so it's specific. Therefore, it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion about adding experiments but doesn't provide any justification or evidence.

It's vague and doesn't offer concrete reasons why adding these experiments would be useful. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does suggest an improvement, but it lacks the necessary details to be fully helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Each aspect has its own criteria and scale from 1 to 5. \n\nFirst, I'll tackle the **Actionability** aspect. The definition here is about whether the review point gives clear instructions on what the author should do. The point says there's a lack of visualization, but it doesn't specify what to do next. It's more of a statement pointing out a problem rather than giving a clear action. So, it's not actionable because the author doesn't know how to fix it. Therefore, I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. This aspect is about how specific the review is regarding the paper's part. The review mentions \"intermediate processes and comparisons\" but doesn't point to a specific section or figure in the paper. It's vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. This means the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. So, I'd give it a 1 here as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is a claim because it suggests a problem (lack of visualization). However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It just states the issue without backing it up with references or logical reasoning. Therefore, it's not verifiable, so I'd rate this as 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out a problem but doesn't offer any specific suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't guide the author on how to enhance their work. Since it lacks concrete advice, it's somewhat helpful but not very. So, I'd rate this as 2 (Barely Helpful).\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is scored based on how well the review point meets the criteria for that specific aspect.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the iteration complexity in Theorem 3 has a dependency on the dimension d, unlike the previous result which had a log d dependency. It also connects this to a paper [15] about perturbed gradient descent. The reviewer is pointing out specific results and their implications. However, the suggestions are quite vague. They don't specify what changes the authors should make or how to implement the suggestions. It seems like the reviewer is just stating observations without giving clear directions. So, this is probably **1: Unactionable** because the actions needed aren't explicit or concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer references a specific paper [15] and points out a particular result about perturbed gradient descent. They also connect it to their own result in Theorem 3. This means the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the relevant parts of the paper, which shows strong grounding. Additionally, they clearly explain what's wrong or missing, which adds specificity. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is citing a specific paper and explaining the implications of its results. They're using logical reasoning to connect their findings to the cited work. While the explanation is clear, it could be more detailed, but it's still verifiable. So, this is **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's sufficient justification but not the most robust evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides some meaningful insights about the results and their implications. They connect their findings to an external paper, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are quite general and don't offer detailed guidance on what changes the authors should make. This makes the review somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive. So, this is **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat helpful because it provides relevant insights, but the other aspects like actionability and verifiability aren't as strong.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the author needs to \"further claim the novelty and contribution of the proposed method.\" That's pretty explicit, so it's not implicit. But the instruction is to \"further claim,\" which is a bit vague. The author knows they need to claim novelty and contribution, but it doesn't specify how. So it's explicit but not very concrete. I think that makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment says \"This work utilizes existing attack methods on a surrogate model.\" It mentions the specific method but doesn't tie it to a particular part of the paper. It's a bit vague. So the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or unique aspect. I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment talks about using transferability of adversarial examples. It's making a claim that this is similar to existing methods. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an observation without supporting evidence. So it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification, but it's not robust or detailed.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review suggests the author needs to claim novelty and contribution. It's clear and gives a direction, but it's quite vague. The author might not know exactly how to frame their contribution. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd give this a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or specificity needed for maximum impact.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the experiment could be strengthened in two ways but doesn't specify what those ways are. So, the action is explicit (implying two ways), but the details are vague. That makes it 3 because it's explicit but lacks concrete steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Prop 3.2 and mentions perturbation values, which are specific parts of the paper. It also clearly states what needs improvement, so this is fully grounded and specific. That's a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides some justification about the correctness relying on a proposition and perturbation values. However, it's a bit vague about how large the perturbation should be and doesn't cite external references, so it's somewhat verifiable. That's a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. It doesn't seem too vague or lacking in guidance, so it's a 4. It's mostly helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Non-convexity may not be an issue for the SGD to converge, if the function Z has some good properties.\" It mentions that non-convexity isn't an issue if the function has good properties. But it doesn't tell the author what those properties are or how to check them. So, the action isn't explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which means the author still needs to figure out what to do. Therefore, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to \"the function Z\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It's too vague. The author doesn't know where to look or what exactly to check. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Maybe a 1 or 2 here too.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim that non-convexity isn't an issue if Z has good properties. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does point out a potential issue with non-convexity and suggests that it's not an issue if Z has good properties. However, it doesn't specify what those properties are or how to verify them. It's somewhat vague, so while it's helpful, it's not fully constructive. Maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at the lower end. Actionability and grounding are both weak because they're vague. Verifiability is low because there's no justification. Helpfulness is also low because it doesn't provide specific actionable steps. So, I think each gets a 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the experimental settings aren't mentioned properly and that result reproducibility is critical. It also says the author doesn't provide the code. This seems like an explicit action because the reviewer is pointing out specific issues the author should fix. Additionally, the reviewer is giving clear directions on what the author needs to do, like mentioning the code. So, this is explicit and concrete. I think this should be a higher score, maybe 4 or 5, but since it's explicit and concrete, I'll go with 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about experimental settings and result reproducibility but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. They also don't mention the code, which is a specific part. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. However, the reviewer does imply the need for more details, which is somewhat specific. So, this might be a 3 because it's not fully grounded but does touch on specific issues.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the experimental settings are not mentioned properly and that the code is missing. They back up the claim by stating that result reproducibility is critical. This provides some justification, but it's a bit vague. They don't cite external references or provide a logical chain of reasoning. So, this is somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out clear issues and giving direct advice on what the author should do. They mention specific areas like experimental settings and code, which are actionable. While it's not the most detailed, it's still helpful. I think this is a 3 because it's somewhat helpful but could be more comprehensive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect is rated a 3 because they either have some issues or could be improved but aren't lacking completely.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the slight improvement in ChatGPT vs. ChatGPT+DSP in tables 6 and 7 doesn't support the claim about experimental results proving the effectiveness. It suggests that the authors should look at the experimental results. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The review is pointing out the issue but isn't giving a direct action. It's more of an implied action. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still have to figure out what to do next. That would make it **1: Unactionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the experimental results but doesn't specify which part of the paper or which tables. It's a bit vague. The authors might have to look at tables 6 and 7 themselves, which isn't very specific. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clearly pointing out the exact section but it's somewhat specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the slight improvement doesn't support the effectiveness claim. It mentions looking at the experimental results but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's vague and lacks supporting evidence. So, it's **2: Borderline Verifiable** because there's some support but it's not sufficient.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a problem but isn't giving clear or detailed suggestions. It's vague about what changes the authors should make. So, it's **2: Barely Helpful** because it does identify an issue but doesn't provide enough guidance.\n\nI think that's a solid breakdown. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and I considered whether the review point meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the cycle FC aligns features at different spatial locations to the same channel but says the analysis is slightly insufficient. It suggests looking into experiments with different sampling intervals and sample sizes. Hmm, so the reviewer is pointing out an area for improvement. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is giving a direction but not exactly telling the authors what to do. They suggest looking into specific experiments, which the authors can follow. So, it's explicit because the action is clear\u2014look into those experiments. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how to implement this, just that they should try different intervals and sizes. So, it's somewhat actionable because the authors know what to do, but they don't know exactly how. So, I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the cycle FC aligning features but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section this refers to. They mention experiments and sampling but don't tie it directly to a figure, table, or unique aspect of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. However, they do mention experiments, which is somewhat specific. So, this would be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review contains a claim that the analysis is slightly insufficient and suggests looking into specific experiments. Now, is this claim verifiable? The reviewer is pointing out a problem but doesn't provide evidence or justification for why the analysis is insufficient. They just suggest experiments, which is a recommendation. There's no logical reasoning or references provided. So, it's somewhat verifiable because they suggest an improvement area, but without supporting evidence, it's not fully verifiable. So, I'd give this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify an area for improvement and suggests experiments. It's clear and actionable, but it doesn't provide much detail on how to implement the suggestion. The authors would need to figure out the specifics themselves, which might make it somewhat helpful. It's not the most helpful because it lacks depth, but it's better than not helpful at all. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the full details needed for maximum impact.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review point is asking about the dimensionality of each region and specifically mentions using which feature extractor. It seems like it's prompting the authors to provide more information about their methodology. Now, is this explicit or implicit? Well, it's directly telling them to specify which feature extractor they're using, so that's explicit. But does it give enough detail on how to apply this information? Not really. The authors would still need to look into their code or methods to find out which extractor they used. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details on how to implement it. That would fall under \"Somewhat Actionable\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is pointing out a specific part of the paper\u2014the dimensionality of each region\u2014and asking about the feature extractor. The authors can identify this part clearly, so it's fully grounded. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the feature extractor. Therefore, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific,\" which is a 5. Wait, but in the initial evaluation, it was labeled as 3. Hmm, maybe I was wrong there. Let me double-check. The grounding is strong because it's pointing to a specific part, and specificity is high because it's asking about the feature extractor. So, yes, 5 makes sense here.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim because it's suggesting that the authors should specify which feature extractor they used. Now, is this claim verifiable? The review doesn't provide any justification or references for why specifying the feature extractor is necessary. It's just a suggestion without any supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable. Therefore, it should be labeled as \"X.\"\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is asking the authors to specify the feature extractor they used. While this is a helpful prompt, it's quite vague. The authors might not know where exactly to look in their code or documentation to find this information. It could be more helpful if it provided a specific place or more guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. A score of 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, helpfulness was 3, grounding was 3, actionability was 3, and verifiability was X. But after re-evaluating grounding_specificity, I think it should be 5. So, maybe the initial labels were a bit off.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the motivation behind using CMD in federated learning is unclear. It suggests that a more explicit demonstration would help. Now, is this action clear? The reviewer is pointing out that the motivation is unclear, which is a specific action. But the suggestion is to demonstrate it more explicitly, which is a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to demonstrate it. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"CMD in federated learning\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or method they're referring to. It's a bit vague. The reviewer is suggesting a more explicit demonstration, but without pointing out exactly where or how that demonstration should occur, the grounding isn't very specific. So, this would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clearly pinpointing the issue, but it's not completely vague either.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the motivation is unclear. It's suggesting a demonstration, but there's no external reference or logical reasoning provided. The claim is that the motivation is unclear, but the justification is just a suggestion. So, it's not well-supported, making it **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a problem (unclear motivation) and suggests a solution (more explicit demonstration). However, the suggestion is quite vague, and the reviewer doesn't provide specific examples or references. While it's helpful in identifying an area for improvement, the lack of concrete guidance makes it somewhat helpful but not fully. So, this would be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the CoNO model uses a complex UNet part after a fractional transform and questions whether the performance boost comes from the fractional transform or the UNet operation. It mentions that comparisons to UNets are inevitable and cites some papers. \n\nHmm, is this explicit or implicit? The review is pointing out a potential issue but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. It suggests that they should compare their model to UNets, but it doesn't provide detailed steps on how to do that. So, it's not giving a clear action, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this falls under **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the fractional transform and the UNet operation, and it references specific papers. It's pretty clear which parts of the paper it's talking about, and it provides examples. So, this seems like it's fully grounded and specific. That would be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the performance boost could come from either part of the model. It supports this with references to other works, which are well-known papers. The reasoning is logical, and the references are solid, so this is thoroughly supported. I'd rate this as **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential improvement area and suggests comparisons to another model. It's clear and provides specific suggestions. While it doesn't go into too much detail on how to perform the comparisons, it's still helpful enough to guide the authors. I think this is **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and constructive but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 5, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the contribution seems marginal because the methods are well-designed and adding another stream for low-resolution isn't a major contribution for a top-tier venue like ICLR. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They don't get a clear action or suggestion. So, this is more of a borderline case. It's not completely unactionable because it does point out that the contribution is marginal, but it doesn't specify how to improve it. I think this falls under 1: Unactionable because the authors still don't know what specific changes to make.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions that the contribution is marginal and suggests adding another method stream. However, it doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper this addition relates to or why it's necessary. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint the exact section or issue. Therefore, this is a 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific. Wait, no, actually, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. So, it's weakly grounded but not specific. So, 3 seems right.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the contribution is marginal and suggests adding a low-resolution stream. It doesn't provide any justification or references for why this isn't a major contribution or why a top-tier venue wouldn't appreciate it. So, there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. Thus, it's a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out that the contribution is marginal and suggests an improvement, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Therefore, a 3: Somewhat Helpful seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The comment is suggesting that the author should read it, but it's vague. It doesn't specify what exactly the author should do or how to apply this suggestion. So, it's not explicit enough. It's more of an implicit action, which would make it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I think it's a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the Appendix but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague. The author is told to read it but not told where exactly. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. It's a 3 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is just stating that the author didn't read the Appendix due to time. There's no justification or evidence provided. It's a claim without any supporting reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment advises the author to read the Appendix but doesn't explain why or how this would help. It's a bit vague and doesn't provide specific suggestions. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 3 except verifiability, which is 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the authors used an \"active learning pipeline\" but isn't clear if it's the same as traditional active learning. It suggests they should clarify this. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is directly pointing out a discrepancy, so that's explicit. Next, is it concrete? The reviewer isn't just saying \"clarify,\" but also asks if it's the same as traditional, which gives a clear direction. So, this should be highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to check and how to respond.\n\nMoving on to **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions the \"active learning pipeline\" method. Is this specific enough? The reviewer doesn't name a section or page, but they do refer to the method being discussed. Since the method is a unique part of the paper, this is fully grounded. Also, the reviewer specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the difference between their method and traditional active learning. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that their method isn't the same as traditional active learning. They suggest clarification but don't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion itself. This is somewhat verifiable because the claim is clear, but there's no supporting evidence. So, it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is clear and directly addresses a potential confusion the authors might have. They ask a specific question to help the authors improve their description. This is helpful but could be more so if it included an example or reference. So, it's mostly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be evaluated as per the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Some technique behind the algorithm may not be that novel, such as computation offloading and gradient augmentation.\" The first thing I notice is that it mentions the technique is not novel, which is a point. But it doesn't specify what exactly is wrong or how to improve it. It just gives examples without any actionable steps. So, it's not giving the authors a clear direction on what to do next. That makes it unactionable because the authors don't know what to fix or how to proceed. So, I'd rate actionability as 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about computation offloading and gradient augmentation. It doesn't explicitly say which part of the paper this refers to, like a specific section or figure. It's just giving examples without pinpointing where exactly the issue is. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't confidently identify the referenced part. Also, it's not specific about what needs fixing. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the technique isn't novel, suggesting areas for improvement. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this technique is novel or where the novelty lies. There's no reference to external works or logical reasoning to support this claim. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing to help the authors understand why this is a problem or how to address it. Thus, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out that the technique isn't novel but doesn't offer any specific suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't guide the authors on what changes to make. Without clear actionable steps, the feedback isn't helpful. So, helpfulness is also 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the integral in Equation (1) corresponds to certain models from other papers. It also points out that the authors assumed observations are averaged but suggests that the data might be aggregated differently, like summation or population-weighted averages. The reviewer is providing some information but doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They're pointing out possible alternative aggregation methods, but it's more of an observation rather than a direct instruction. So, this is explicit but not very detailed on how to apply this information. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's explicit but lacks concrete steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer references specific papers and mentions the type of data (count or rate). They're not just talking about a general part of the paper but specifically about the integral and the aggregation process. This shows that they've identified a specific section and provided details about what might be wrong there. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific\" because they're pinning down the exact part and explaining what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the data might be aggregated differently. They're suggesting possible alternatives but aren't providing external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's a bit vague, so I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because there's some justification but not enough to fully support the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out potential issues with the data aggregation but doesn't offer clear, actionable steps for the authors. They're making a good point but not giving enough guidance on how to proceed. This makes it somewhat helpful but not the most helpful. So, I'd say it's \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it does provide some insight but lacks the depth needed for full assistance.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the provided review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors' method underperforms the baseline in some cases and questions the extent of the performance improvement. It suggests moving code-switched pretraining from word to sense level but doesn't specify how to improve this. So, the action is clear\u2014improve the method\u2014but the details are vague. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I think a 3 is appropriate.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the method's underperformance and the specific claim about moving pretraining. It accurately points out the issue without being too vague. The grounding is solid because it mentions the specific claim and the method's limitations. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the method's performance and the reasoning behind the suggestion. It explains why the underperformance is a concern but doesn't provide external references or examples. It's somewhat verifiable, so a 3 seems right.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issues and provides suggestions, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into depth about how to fix the problem or provide more context. So, it's mostly helpful, which I'll rate as a 4.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"In section 4, I don't see the reason why separators are introduced. what additional info they convene beyond T/I/O?\" The author is asking for a reason behind the introduction of separators and what additional information they provide beyond T/I/O. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit or implicit. The reviewer is asking a question, which is a direct action. They want the author to explain why separators were added and what extra info they provide. So, it's explicit because the reviewer is clearly asking for an explanation. \n\nNext, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking for a reason and additional info, so the author knows exactly what to do. They need to provide the rationale behind the separators. So, it's concrete because the action is clear. \n\nTherefore, this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while it's explicit and concrete, it might not be the most detailed or helpful in terms of guiding the author on how to improve the section.\n\nMoving on to **grounding_specificity**: The review points to section 4 and asks about the reason for separators and additional info. The reviewer is specifically referring to a part of the paper, so that's good. However, the question is quite general. The author might not know exactly which part is being referred to beyond just section 4. \n\nThe grounding is weak because the reviewer is making an educated guess that the author is referring to section 4. It's not fully pinpointed. As for specificity, the reviewer is asking for a reason and additional info, which is clear, but since the grounding is weak, it doesn't fully meet the criteria for higher specificity. \n\nSo, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because the grounding is weak, but the specificity is good.\n\nNext is **verifiability**: The review is a question asking for a reason and additional info. There's no claim being made here; it's more of a request for clarification. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiability. Therefore, it's **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking a question to get more information about why separators were introduced and what extra info they provide. While this provides some context, it's quite vague. The author might not get a detailed explanation or clear guidance on how to improve the section. It's helpful but not very detailed or actionable. \n\nSo, this should be **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does provide some insight but lacks depth or clarity.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: X\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using longer video sequences and mentions that the results are improved over the state-of-the-art. It doesn't specify exactly what changes to make, like adding more data or modifying the model. So, it's explicit in pointing out a potential improvement but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about inconsistent motion and mentions UCF-101 as a dataset. It also suggests a longer video duration. It's pretty specific about the dataset and the problem areas, so I think this is fully grounded. There's no part where it's vague or not pointing to a specific section. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the results are improved over the state-of-the-art but doesn't provide evidence or references. It just states an opinion without supporting data. That means it's not verifiable because there's no justification or examples backing up the claim. So, this should be a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a suggestion about using longer videos and mentions the dataset's issues. It also praises the idea and the experiments but doesn't go into depth about how to implement the changes. It's somewhat helpful because it gives a direction, but it's not very detailed. So, a 4 seems appropriate here.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

The review is asking a question, but does it tell the authors what to do? It seems like it's just posing a question without giving any specific instructions or actions. So, it's not explicit or implicit in telling them how to improve. Therefore, it's unactionable, which would be a 1.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions \"men and women\" and \"insurance,\" but it's too vague. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing, like a particular table or figure. It's just a general question without pinpointing the issue. So, it's not grounded because the authors can't tell exactly where to focus their attention. That's also a 1.\n\nVerifiability. The review is a question, which is a normal statement. There's no claim or opinion being made, so it doesn't require any justification or evidence. Therefore, it's not verifiable, which is an X.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is a question without providing any specific feedback or suggestions. It doesn't help the authors improve their work because it's just asking about something without addressing any weaknesses or offering actionable advice. So, it's not helpful at all, which is a 1.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 1 except verifiability, which is X. But since the user asked for a single score, I think the lowest score is 1, so the helpfulness label is 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper splits papers by their publication years on the ACL anthology but points out that many papers were posted on arXiv earlier. It suggests that this might be a problem. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review doesn't specify any changes or improvements the authors should make. It just points out an issue but doesn't tell them how to fix it or what to do next. So, this is more of a comment than an actionable suggestion. Therefore, it's probably **1: Unactionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review talks about splitting by ACL anthology years but doesn't clearly identify which specific part of the paper this refers to, like sections, tables, or figures. It also mentions arXiv but doesn't tie it directly to the paper's structure or content. So, the grounding isn't very strong because it's not pinpointing the exact issue. It's more general, so I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the issue but doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that splitting by ACL years might cause issues because papers were on arXiv earlier. It doesn't provide any evidence or justification for this claim. There's no reference to external literature or logical reasoning to support why this is a problem. So, it's only a claim without support, making it **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or improvements. It doesn't guide the authors on how to address the problem or what changes to make. Without specific advice, it's not very helpful. So, this would be **1: Not Helpful at All**.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about grounding_specificity. Maybe the review does imply the issue is with how papers are organized by publication year, which is a specific part of the paper. So perhaps it's not weakly grounded but more grounded. Hmm, but it doesn't explicitly name the section or part. It's still a bit vague. I think my initial assessment holds.\n\nAnd for verifiability, since there's no support, it's definitely unverifiable. Actionability is definitely unactionable because it doesn't suggest fixes. Helpfulness is low because it doesn't provide actionable steps.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 1, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, helpfulness 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors are relaxing rejection sampling by using an arbitrary parameter \u03b2 instead of the true upper bound. It also points out that the reviewer doesn't understand why they didn't use Importance Sampling. Additionally, it questions the difference between QRS and RS in the algorithm. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does suggest an alternative method (Importance Sampling) but doesn't provide a clear explanation of why it's better or how to implement it. They also ask about the difference between two methods but don't specify how to check that. So, it's not entirely explicit, and the suggestions are vague. That would probably be a 3 on the actionable scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions specific parts of the paper, like Algorithm 1 and the difference between QRS and RS. They also suggest using Importance Sampling. Since they're pointing out specific sections and methods, this is fully grounded. Additionally, they're clear about what needs to be addressed, so it's specific. That should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about why Importance Sampling is better and about the difference between QRS and RS. They don't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks key elements.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer does identify some issues and suggests improvements, but the suggestions are vague and don't provide concrete steps. They ask questions without giving clear guidance, which makes it somewhat helpful but not fully. So, a 3 here as well.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the review point's content.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is a bit vague. It says, \"a bit confused about the phrase 'non-sequential information such as chunks'. Is chunk still sequential information???\". The reviewer is asking for clarification but isn't providing a direct action or suggestion. They're just pointing out confusion and asking a question. So, it's not explicit because the action isn't clear. It's more of a question than a directive, so I don't think it's explicit. It's also not concrete because they're not telling the author how to proceed. So, this is borderline actionable because it does suggest an action but it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"chunks\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. They're using a general term, so it's not fully grounded. They also don't provide specific examples or clarify what exactly is wrong with chunks. So, this is weakly grounded and not specific because they're not pinpointing the issue clearly.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review point is a question asking for clarification. There's no claim being made here; it's just a request for more information. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiability. So, it's an \"X\" because there's no claim to verify.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking for clarification but isn't providing any specific suggestions or actionable steps. They're leaving the author hanging with just a question. This is somewhat helpful because it does show concern, but it's not very helpful overall. It doesn't give the author a clear path forward, so it's somewhat helpful but not highly so.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3 (Borderline Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: X (No Claim)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking if the problem applies to other downstream tasks or is specific to binding affinity prediction. It's a good question, but does it give the authors a clear action? It seems like it's prompting for more information rather than telling them what to do. So, it's not explicit or vague. I think this is **unactionable**, so a score of 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review is asking about other downstream tasks but doesn't specify which ones. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint exactly where the problem lies, so it's not grounded. The score here should be 1 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim by asking a question, but it's not supported by any evidence or reasoning. It's just a question without any backing, so it's not verifiable. The score is X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question without providing any actionable feedback or solutions. It doesn't help the authors improve their work because there's no concrete suggestions. So, it's not helpful at all, scoring 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is quite vague and doesn't provide clear guidance, making it unhelpful and lacking in the other aspects.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

How about the comparison in terms of computation cost / running time?\" based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Each aspect has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The comment is asking about a comparison but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's more of a question than a suggestion. Without a clear action, the authors don't know how to improve. So, it's not actionable because it's vague and doesn't provide a direct instruction.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to computation cost and running time but doesn't specify which part of the paper or figure it's talking about. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. Therefore, it's not grounded because it lacks specific references.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion about a comparison but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just a request for the authors to consider it, which doesn't help them verify if it's valid or necessary. So, it's unverifiable because there's no supporting reasoning or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is asking a question rather than providing a suggestion. It doesn't help the authors by guiding them on what changes to make or why the comparison matters. It's not helpful because it doesn't offer actionable feedback.\n\nSo, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because they don't meet the criteria for higher scores in each category.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"In Section 3 (line 247-252), I am wondering tables are divided into three types. For me, one type (the column header) should work.\" The author is pointing out a specific section and suggesting a change. That seems like an explicit action because they're directly telling the author where to focus their attention. But the action isn't very detailed. They're just asking the author to consider how the tables are divided, not exactly what changes to make. So, I think this is borderline actionable because it's explicit but lacks concrete details on how to implement the change. So, I'll give it a 2.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"Section 3 (line 247-252)\" and talks about tables being divided into three types, specifically pointing out the column header. The author is accurately pinpointing the section and the issue within it. They're not just making a general comment but specifically addressing a part of the paper. So, this has full grounding because they're clearly identifying the section and the issue. However, the specificity is average. They're pointing out the problem but don't give a detailed explanation of what's wrong or how to fix it. So, I'll rate this a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a claim by suggesting a change in how tables are divided. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. The reviewer is just stating their opinion without backing it up with references or logical reasoning. So, this falls under unverifiable because there's no evidence to support the claim. I'll assign an X here.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out a specific area for improvement and suggests a change. However, the suggestion is quite vague. The author is asked to consider the division of tables but isn't given a clear direction on how to adjust it. This makes the feedback somewhat helpful but not entirely constructive. So, I'll rate this a 3 because it's somewhat helpful but could be improved by providing more details.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 2, grounding_specificity: 3, verifiability: X, helpfulness: 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the task is more about Argument Mining than Summarization and suggests clarifying differences. It doesn't specify what changes to make, so it's not explicit. It's vague because it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to improve. So, it's somewhere between 2 and 3. I think 3 because it's explicit about the task but lacks detail on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Argument Mining and summarization but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It's too vague about what needs clarification. So, it's weakly grounded because it's not clear which section is being referred to. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't specify the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the paper's focus and suggests an improvement area. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up why this is an issue or how it's different from other tasks. So, it's not fully verifiable because there's no justification or support given.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a problem and suggests an improvement, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or evidence, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate it as 3 because it's helpful but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated a 3 because they all fall into the middle category of being somewhat actionable, weakly grounded, not fully justified, and providing some helpfulness without being comprehensive.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review mentions specific models and datasets, like CIFAR100 and ResNet variants, and asks for more substantial experiments. It also poses questions about challenges in language tasks. However, it's vague on how to implement these changes. The suggestions are clear, but the details on how to apply them aren't provided. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. I think this is a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but not fully detailed.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe review refers to models and datasets by name, which is specific. It mentions different architectures and tasks, clearly pointing to specific parts of the paper. The grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections being discussed. So, this should be a 5.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe review contains claims about the toy-like nature of the models and the desirability of more complex datasets. These claims are supported by logical reasoning and references to standard benchmarks like CIFAR100 and ResNet models. The evidence is clear and sufficient, so this is a 4 because it's mostly verifiable with minor gaps.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review provides specific suggestions and raises relevant questions, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, though it could be expanded. Overall, it's quite helpful, so a 4 makes sense here.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects properly. Now, I'll format the response as required.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that there's no comparison against baselines and that the study only reports accuracy across optimization levels of binaries. It also points out that many papers have developed architecture-agnostic methods. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review suggests that the authors should consider baselines and architecture-agnostic methods, which is a clear action. But does it tell them exactly how to implement this? It says \"consider\" but doesn't specify, so it's a bit vague. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about functionality similarity and mentions codesearch as a similar task. It doesn't explicitly point out which part of the paper this refers to, like a specific section or figure. It's a bit unclear, so the grounding isn't very specific. It's more of a general comment without pinpointing the issue, so I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clear but does hint at something.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the study lacks baselines and that many papers have done similar work. It references codesearch as a similar task. Now, verifiability is about how well the claim is supported. The review provides some justification by mentioning codesearch, which is a reference, but it's not very detailed. It's somewhat verifiable but not fully. So, I'd give this a **3: Somewhat Verifiable** score.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out several areas for improvement but doesn't specify exactly what changes the authors should make. It mentions baselines and similar tasks but doesn't guide them on how to implement these changes. It's clear that the authors need to consider these aspects, but without more detailed guidance, it's somewhat helpful. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nOverall, each aspect is clear but not fully actionable or well-supported, leading to a 3 in each category.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the contribution isn't enough and mentions addressing overfitting with GANs and limited data, then proposes differentiable augmentation. It ends by saying it's important but still limited. Hmm, the comment points out a problem but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's more of a critique without actionable steps. So, it's not explicit or implicit because there's no clear direction for improvement. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about overfitting, GANs, and limited data. It's a bit vague about which part of the paper it's addressing. It doesn't clearly pinpoint a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not accurately identifying the referenced part. It's not fully grounded either because it's not providing specific details about what's wrong.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the contribution is not enough and suggests areas for improvement. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just stating opinions without justification, so it's not verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out some issues and suggests areas for improvement, but it's quite vague. It doesn't give specific actions or references, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very detailed or actionable. So, it's barely helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 1 because they're all either unhelpful or not well-supported.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the proof relies on a special case and that the authors acknowledge this in Section 3. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. It just points out a limitation without providing a solution. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give concrete steps on how to fix it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review references Section 3 and mentions the special case, which is pretty specific. It doesn't just say \"Section 3\" but explains why it's relevant. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the specific part of the paper without needing more context. That should be a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the proof uses a special case and that the authors acknowledge this. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's just a claim without support. That makes it **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing to make it believable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't suggest any improvements. It's clear and identifies an issue, but without actionable steps, it's somewhat helpful. So, it's a **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it gives some insight but lacks depth.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects. Let me just double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests replacing \"t\" with the size of T in the histogram intersection kernel. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it doesn't provide any details on how to implement this change, like where exactly to make the replacement or how it affects the code. So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the specifics are missing. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I'd rate it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions replacing \"t\" with the size of T but doesn't specify which part of the paper or code that refers to. It's vague about the exact location or context. So, the grounding isn't strong because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. I'd give this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests replacing \"t\" with the size of T but doesn't provide any justification or reasoning why this change would be beneficial. It just states the action without backing it up. There's no reference to external literature or logical reasoning, so it's not verifiable. This would score a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does point out a specific area for improvement, which is helpful. However, it doesn't explain why this change is necessary or how it benefits the work. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an area, but it lacks depth and reasoning. So, I'd rate this a 3.\n\nOverall, the review is clear about the action but lacks specifics and reasoning, making it somewhat helpful and grounding, but not fully actionable or verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point asks if the general Gaussian distribution can be assumed instead of the isotropic one and what the difference is. It's a direct question, so the action is explicit. However, it doesn't tell the author exactly how to implement this change or what the implications are. It's vague on the specifics, so it's not fully actionable. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the type of Gaussian distribution used in the algorithm. It's specific in that it mentions both \"general Gaussian\" and \"isotropic Gaussian,\" which are parts of the paper. It doesn't make any general comments, so it's grounded. But it doesn't specify what needs to be addressed, like the consequences of changing the distribution. So it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it's making a suggestion about the algorithm. It needs justification, but the review point doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning. It just poses a question, so it's not verifiable. That would be **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is asking a question and explaining the difference, which gives the author some insight. However, it's not very detailed and doesn't guide the author on how to proceed. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Each has its own scale and definition.\n\nFirst, let's tackle actionability. The review point is asking about the intent of a section. Is this explicit or implicit? Well, it's a question, so it's more of an implicit action. The authors would need to figure out what the intent is, but there's no concrete guidance on how to do that. So it's not explicit, and since it's just a question without any suggestions, it's not very actionable. So I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review points out the part of the paper. The comment is about Section 5.2, which is pretty specific. However, it's just asking a question without providing any specific details or examples. So while it's grounded because it refers to a specific section, it's not very specific in explaining what the intent is. Therefore, I'd rate this as 1 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a question, which doesn't contain a claim. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiable or unverifiable. So it should be marked as \"X\" for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is a question that doesn't provide any actionable feedback. It doesn't tell the authors what they should do or how to improve their section. So it's not helpful at all, which would be a score of 1.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 1 because the review point is just a question without any actionable or specific guidance.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the proposed approach is learning a surrogate model for solving FEM problems but still requires choosing basis functions, meshes, and assembling stiffness matrices, especially using FEniCS. It also points out that while current methods aren't as accurate as specialized solvers, they're more universal. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what to do next. The review does suggest that the approach relies on FEniCS and that operator learning isn't as accurate yet, but it doesn't explicitly tell the authors how to improve their method. It's more of a commentary rather than a direct action. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe it's a 3 because it's somewhat explicit but vague on the steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review talks about basis functions, meshes, and stiffness matrices, which are specific parts of the paper. It also mentions FEniCS, a specific tool. So, the review does ground the feedback in specific sections and tools. However, it doesn't clearly explain what needs to be changed or why. It's a bit vague on the issues, so maybe it's a 3 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that current methods aren't as accurate as specialized solvers but don't provide evidence or references to back this claim. It's more of an opinion without solid justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary support, making it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does point out limitations and mentions FEniCS, which could be helpful. However, it's somewhat vague and doesn't provide detailed suggestions. It gives a starting point but doesn't elaborate much, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. A 3 seems appropriate here too.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or specificity needed for full actionability, grounding, verifiability, or helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the author was confused about whether the paper targets single-token or multi-token cloze queries. They mention that the confusion wasn't clarified until reading the conclusion. Now, actionability is about how clear the suggestions are. \n\nIn this case, the review doesn't explicitly tell the author what to do. It just points out the confusion and mentions that the clarification is in the conclusion. So the author still needs to go back to the conclusion to find the answer. That means the action isn't clear or direct. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which might be a bit vague. So I think this is **1: Unactionable** because the author doesn't know exactly where to look for clarification.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in pointing out the part of the paper. The review mentions that the confusion is about the type of cloze queries targeted, but it doesn't specify whether it's in the introduction, methods, or results sections. It just says \"the conclusion.\" So the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. Therefore, this is **1: Not Grounded**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the distinction between single-token and multi-token cloze queries is important. It just states that the author was confused and that the conclusion clarifies it. There's no supporting reasoning or references, so this is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a potential confusion the author might have, which is helpful. However, it doesn't specify where to find the clarification, making it somewhat vague. Without clear guidance, the author might not know how to proceed, so it's only **1: Not Helpful at All**.\n\nOverall, the review lacks clarity and specific guidance, making it unhelpful and not grounded or verifiable, and not actionable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

It's hard to reproduce the results. Will the code be public avaliable.\" I'll go through each aspect one by one.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review points out two issues: difficulty in reproducing results and asks about code availability. However, it doesn't suggest any specific actions the authors should take, like providing data or code. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. That's a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions the code but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's vague because it doesn't clearly identify the section or figure. So, grounding specificity is also a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review makes a claim by asking about code availability, but there's no supporting evidence or references. It's just a question without justification, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1 for verifiability, and it's marked as X because there's no claim.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review raises a valid concern about code availability, which is helpful, but it's vague and doesn't provide concrete suggestions. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That's a 3 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Therefore, the technical contribution of the paper is limited.\" The user has provided definitions for four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Each has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review points out that kNN-ECD is similar to kNN-MT and concludes that the technical contribution is limited. Is this an explicit action or a vague statement? The comment doesn't tell the authors what to do next. It just states the similarity and suggests a limitation. So, it's not giving a clear action, which makes it borderline actionable. Since it's not explicit, it's probably labeled as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to kNN-ECD and kNN-MT but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is being compared. It's a general statement without pinpointing the issue or the specific section. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment contains a claim that the technical contribution is limited. It needs to be supported. However, the justification is vague. The reviewer doesn't provide any reasoning or references to back up why the contribution is limited. It's just a statement without evidence, so it's unverifiable. Hence, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment identifies a potential limitation but doesn't provide specific suggestions or reasoning. It's a negative statement without actionable steps. The authors won't get clear guidance on how to improve their work. So, it's not helpful at all, making helpfulness 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all labels are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"I wasn\u2019t clear on the numbers of parameters used in each approach.\" The user is pointing out that the numbers aren't clear. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the review gives a clear instruction on what to do. In this case, the reviewer is indicating a problem but isn't suggesting a fix. They're asking for clarification on the numbers, but they're not providing a specific action like adding more details or explaining the parameters. So, this is more of a clarifying question rather than a direct action. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it's implicit, but vague. So, I'd rate it as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review mentions \"the numbers of parameters used in each approach\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly the issue lies. It's too vague. The reviewer isn't pointing to a specific section, table, or figure. So, this is not grounded because they can't pinpoint the issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is a claim because it's making a judgment about the clarity of the numbers. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. The reviewer is stating that the numbers aren't clear but isn't explaining why or how to verify that. There's no reference to external knowledge or logical reasoning. So, it's unverifiable, which means verifiability is X.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is somewhat helpful because it does identify an issue, but it's not specific or detailed. The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't offering a solution. This leaves the authors with a vague point to work on, which might not be enough for them to know exactly what to do. So, it's somewhat helpful, but not fully. Therefore, helpfulness is 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the evaluation results are based on only three trials, which is fine but not statistically significant. It suggests that the deviations are 0 and advises against making claims about performance improvements. The comment is pointing out a limitation but isn't providing any specific actions or suggestions for improvement. It's more of a critique without actionable steps. So, it's not fully actionable but also not completely unactionable. I think this falls under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does mention an action (implying improvement is needed) but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the evaluation being based on three trials, which is a specific part of the paper. It also mentions that statistically, it's not significant and that certain deviation statements don't make sense. This seems to clearly identify the part of the paper being addressed, so it's well-grounded. Additionally, it explains why the deviation is 0, which is specific. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is pointing out a limitation in the methodology but isn't providing any evidence or justification for why three trials are insufficient. It's making a judgment about the statistical significance but without backing it up. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks strong support. This would be **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is critiquing the methodology and pointing out a limitation, which is helpful for the authors to understand the study's shortcomings. However, it doesn't offer specific suggestions for improvement beyond what was already mentioned. It's somewhat helpful but not fully constructive. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the specific content of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that increasing model size can hurt performance and references another paper. It suggests providing more details on the experimental results. The action is clear: authors should provide more details. But the instruction on how to do this isn't specific. They just say \"provide in detail\" without suggesting how or where. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review references Ni et al. and talks about model size on Wikipedia. It clearly mentions a specific paper and a specific aspect (model size impact). So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the referenced work and the part of the paper being discussed. That should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that increasing model size shouldn't hurt based on another paper. It provides a reference, which is good. However, the reasoning is a bit vague. It just states the claim and references another study without explaining why or how the scaling laws apply. So, it's somewhat supported but not fully. That would be **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue with model size and references another study. It suggests providing more details, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into how to improve the model or suggest alternative approaches. It's clear and actionable but could be more detailed. So, it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"I\u2019d be interested to know if other multilingual pretraining setups also struggle with Greek.\" Hmm, this is more of a question than a suggestion. The authors might not know how to respond or what exactly to do next. It doesn't give a clear action or direction, so it's not very actionable. I think this falls under borderline actionable because it's vague.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is asking about other setups struggling with Greek. But it's not pinpointing a specific part of the paper. It's more general, so the authors can't tell exactly where the issue is. This is weak grounding because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or issue.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is just a question. There's no justification or evidence provided. It's not supporting any claim, so it's classified as X, meaning no claim.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is a question without any real guidance. It doesn't help the authors improve their work because there's no actionable feedback. So it's somewhat helpful but not very.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores make sense based on each aspect's criteria.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests extending the analysis to multiple trucks and drones. It's explicit about the action, which is to consider more scenarios. However, it doesn't provide concrete steps on how to do that. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out the implementation details. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about considering more scenarios but doesn't specify which ones or how it relates to the paper. It's vague about the part of the paper being addressed. So, it's not fully grounded because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. That would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't claim anything or provide any justification. It's just a suggestion without supporting evidence. So, it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is somewhat helpful because it suggests a useful extension, but it's vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that if 's' contains dynamic factors, subtracting it from dynamic information might cause loss, making it hard for LSTM to capture changes. It gives a specific action by pointing out the issue, so that's explicit. But it doesn't tell the author exactly how to fix it. So it's explicit but lacks detail on implementation. I think that's a 4 because it's somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions 's' and dynamic factors, which are specific parts of the paper. It clearly identifies the issue without guessing. So this should be fully grounded and specific. That's a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states a claim that subtracting 's' causes loss of information. It doesn't provide evidence or reasoning, so it's not well-supported. It's a bit vague, so maybe a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks key elements.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific problem and suggests a potential issue for the LSTM. It's clear and actionable, though it doesn't offer a solution. It's helpful but could be more so. I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded.\n\nSo putting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking about the number of MC samples and network structure affecting performance. It's a good question, but does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It seems like it's more of a general question without specific instructions. So, it's not giving clear actions or steps the authors should take. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about whether the review points to a specific part of the paper. The review is asking about empirical studies on MC samples and network structure. It's a broad question, not pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the part of the paper being discussed. I'll give this a 1 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is asking about empirical studies, which is a claim. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification. It just poses a question without backing it up. So, it's not verifiable. I'll mark this as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking two questions but doesn't provide any answers or suggestions. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve their work. So, it's not helpful at all. I'll rate this as 1.\n\nOverall, the review is quite vague and doesn't provide clear, actionable feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The notations of $\\hat{Y}$ and $Y$ are used in a mixed way in Section 2.\" It mentions the notations but doesn't specify what needs to be done. So, the reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a clear action. That makes it borderline actionable because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to fix it. So, I think actionability is a 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to Section 2 without being specific about which part of Section 2. It just says \"Section 2\" which isn't enough. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. But it does mention what's wrong, so it's not fully grounded. Therefore, grounding_specificity is a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting a problem with the notation usage. However, there's no justification or reasoning provided. It just states that the notation is mixed. Without any supporting evidence or explanation, it's unverifiable. So, verifiability is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem but doesn't provide specific suggestions or explain why the notation mix is an issue. It's clear that there's a problem, but the reviewer doesn't help the authors understand how to improve it. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Using r to denote the risk for minimization problems and primal risk for minimax problem at the same time is confusing.\" The action here is pointing out that using r for both is confusing. However, it doesn't suggest any specific changes or how to fix this. It's more of a statement pointing out a problem without offering a solution. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"r to denote the risk for minimization problems and primal risk for minimax problem.\" It's specific about the variables but doesn't explain why this is confusing or how it affects the paper. It doesn't reference a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is weak. It's pointing out an issue but not clearly linking it to a specific section or figure. So, I'd give it a 1 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a judgment that using r for both is confusing. There's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. It's just a statement of opinion without backing. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or examples given.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"It is unclear how the authors arrived at the different components of the 'scoring function,' nor is it clear how they arrived at the different threshold values/ranges.\" The reviewer is pointing out that the scoring function's components and thresholds aren't explained. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit or implicit. The reviewer is stating that something is unclear, which is an explicit action. However, they're not providing any specific steps or details on how the scoring function was developed. So, it's explicit in pointing out the lack of clarity but vague on how to improve it. That makes it borderline actionable because the action is there, but it's not detailed enough.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is about the scoring function's components and thresholds. The reviewer isn't pinpointing a specific part of the paper or method. They're making a general statement about the scoring function, so the grounding is weak. Also, they're not specifying what needs to be addressed, so it's not grounded at all.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim because it's suggesting that the authors should explain how they arrived at the scoring function. The reviewer is providing some reasoning by saying it's unclear, but it's vague and lacks specific references or examples. So, it's borderline verifiable because there's some justification but not enough to fully support the claim.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a lack of clarity in the scoring function. While it's helpful to point out areas for improvement, the comment is vague and doesn't offer specific suggestions. It's clear that the authors need to explain their scoring function, but without more details, the feedback isn't very helpful. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect that the review is borderline actionable, not grounded, borderline verifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review points out that the model comparison is thorough but lacks a wide range of datasets. It specifically mentions that only one dataset has categorical features, which are more challenging, and others are numerical. It also advises using one hot encoding for that one dataset. This seems like a clear action the authors can take. They know exactly what to do: check their encoding methods. So, this is explicit and concrete. I think this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions categorical vs. numerical features and suggests one hot encoding. It doesn't refer to a specific part of the paper beyond that. I'm not sure if it's fully grounded because it's talking about a general method's impact. But it does identify the issue clearly, so maybe it's weakly grounded but specific. I'm leaning towards a 4.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review explains why the omission of one hot encoding might affect performance, but it's a bit vague. It doesn't cite any external references or provide a logical chain of reasoning beyond the categorical features being challenging. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review gives specific advice on datasets and encoding, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, so it's mostly helpful but could be a bit more detailed. I'd rate this a 4.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Now, I'll put it all together.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests replacing two datasets with better ones but doesn't specify how to do that. It mentions alternative datasets but doesn't give clear steps or examples. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but lacks detail on how to fix it. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think a 4 here.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the review mentions specific datasets like FlatCam Face and Head-pose detection, which are clearly referenced. It also suggests alternative datasets without being vague. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the parts of the paper being discussed. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **verifiability**: The review provides some reasoning about why the current datasets are problematic and suggests alternatives. However, it doesn't cite external references or provide logical deductions beyond what's obvious. It's somewhat verifiable but not fully. So, a 3 seems right.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out weaknesses and suggests improvements. It's helpful because it guides the authors to consider better datasets. It's not the most detailed but provides enough value. I'll rate it a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the authors moved the regret bound to the appendix but didn't find it in the supplementary material. It seems like the reviewer is trying to suggest that the authors check the supplementary for the missing information. This is an explicit action because the reviewer is directly telling the authors where to look. But the problem is that the reviewer doesn't explain how to apply this action. They don't tell the authors what to do next, like actually search the supplementary or what to look for. So it's explicit but lacks detail, making it somewhat actionable. I think a 3 here because it's clear the action is there but not fully explained.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions the supplementary material, which is specific. They also point out the missing regret bound, which is a clear issue. So the comment is grounded because it accurately refers to the supplementary and identifies the specific missing part. It's also specific because it details exactly what's missing. I'd give this a 5 because it's both grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the supplementary doesn't have the regret bound. They don't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this. It's just a statement without justification. So it's not verifiable because there's no backing for the claim. I think a 1 here since it's a claim without support.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue and suggesting where the authors should look. It's clear and actionable, but it doesn't go beyond that. It doesn't offer any additional suggestions or context. So while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed feedback. I'd rate this a 3 because it's somewhat helpful but could be expanded.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, detail, and support provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the proposed compression performs worse than PQ when a small code length is allowed. I think this is an explicit action because it directly points out a problem. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It mentions the weakness but doesn't specify how to fix it. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 2 because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to improve.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the performance being worse than PQ with a small code length. It's specific about the comparison and the condition. The authors can pinpoint where the issue is, so this has full grounding. It also clearly states what's wrong, so it's specific. I think this would be a 5 because it's both grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claim is that the method's performance is worse. The comment doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It just states it without backing. So, it's unverifiable. Maybe a 1 because there's no justification or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a weakness but doesn't suggest any improvements. It's clear and identifies an issue, but without concrete advice, it's somewhat helpful.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review point is: \"3. p indicates the proportion of documents, I would like to know how the parts of sentences and documents are extracted? Do the rules of extraction have any effect on the experiment? I hope to see a more detailed analysis.\" \n\nThe reviewer is asking for an explanation of how proportions are calculated and whether the extraction rules impact the experiment. This is a clear question, so it's explicit. However, the reviewer doesn't provide any specific steps or methods on how to extract the parts. It's vague because they don't give details on how to calculate proportions or what extraction rules to use. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer is asking about the extraction process but doesn't specify which part of the paper or document they're referring to. They mention \"proportions of documents\" but don't tie it to a specific section or figure. They also ask about the rules affecting the experiment but don't clearly link this to a particular part. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. However, they do mention specific terms like \"proportions\" and \"extraction rules,\" which adds some specificity. So, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is asking for an explanation and doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning. They're seeking information but without justification or evidence. This means the claim (which is implied by the request for information) isn't well-supported. It's somewhat verifiable because they do ask a question, but without backing, it's not fully verifiable. So, I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer is asking for a detailed analysis and clarifications but doesn't specify what exactly they need. They're vague about the areas they want improved. This makes the feedback somewhat helpful but not very actionable or specific.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says that L107-114 is speculative or opinionated and should be a remark or removed. It doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done, like suggesting a rewrite or providing examples. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's not clear on how to apply, it's not actionable. I think this falls under somewhat actionable because it mentions the issue but doesn't give concrete steps. So, maybe a 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to lines 107-114 but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It just says it's speculative. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the section. It's not fully grounded. Also, it doesn't explain why those lines are problematic, so specificity is lacking. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment says the content is speculative or opinionated. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why those lines are problematic. There's no justification or references, so it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 here.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out an issue and suggests a solution, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't give specific advice on what to do. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies a problem but doesn't fully guide the authors on how to fix it. So, a 3 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 3 except verifiability which is 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Why use the VMF distribution and the truncated normal distribution to characterize the angle and magnitude of the target vector? The motivation behind this is unclear to me.\" The author is asking a question but not providing any suggestions or actions. They're pointing out that the motivation is unclear but aren't offering any solutions or further explanation. So, this isn't explicit because it's more of a question than a suggestion. It's also vague because it doesn't give any details on why these distributions were chosen. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at a lack of clarity but doesn't specify what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the VMF distribution and truncated normal distribution but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's unclear which section or figure is being discussed. The author is making a general comment without pinning down the exact issue. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. However, the comment does detail what's wrong\u2014the motivation is unclear. So, it's weakly grounded but specific in pointing out the lack of motivation. Therefore, this would be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the motivation is unclear. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. The author is stating an opinion but isn't backing it up with reasons or references. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to validate the claim. Thus, it's labeled as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question and pointing out a lack of clarity but isn't providing any constructive suggestions. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue, but it's not actionable or detailed enough.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that it's unclear how the quantitative results were obtained, specifically what data was used for training, validating, and testing. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what needs to be done. In this case, the reviewer is asking for clarification on the data used. It's not giving an explicit action like \"add a figure\" or \"modify a section.\" Instead, it's prompting the authors to explain their methodology. So, it's more of an implicit action. Since it's not giving a direct instruction, it's not fully actionable. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't tell exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review mentions the data used for training, validating, and testing but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where to look in the paper for this information. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's somewhat vague but does imply the part being addressed.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review is asking for clarification on the data used. There's no claim being made here; it's just a request for more information. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiability. So, this should be marked as **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for clarification on how the results were obtained. While it's helpful in prompting the authors to explain their methodology, it doesn't provide specific suggestions or solutions. It's more of a request for information rather than actionable feedback.

Similar to 2, please DO NOT just show me what you have done and achieved, but also show me why and how you manage to do these.\" It's asking the authors to explain not just the results but also the reasoning behind them. The comment is explicit about wanting an explanation, so that's clear. However, it doesn't give specific steps or methods on how to improve. It's more of a request for a deeper explanation rather than providing actionable steps. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. I think this would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear about the action but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"how does it help\" and refers to \"Similar to 2.\" It's not very specific about which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a bit vague because it doesn't pin down the exact section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't precisely identify what part is being discussed. It's not fully grounded, so I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does specify what needs to be addressed but doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim by asking the authors to explain why and how the improvement can be done. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for this request. It's just a directive without backing, so it's not verifiable. I think this would be a **1: Unverifiable** because there's no reasoning or references provided to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for a deeper explanation, which is helpful because it encourages the authors to elaborate. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide specific guidance on what to do or how to improve. It's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So, I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful** because it does provide some actionable feedback but could be more detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 3, grounding_specificity: 3, verifiability: 1, and helpfulness: 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Why is the approach limited to two views, it feels like the system should be able to generalize to more views without too much difficulty?\" The author is pointing out a limitation in the approach. The comment is asking for an explanation, which is a form of action. However, it's not giving a specific step or change the authors need to make. It's more of a general question, so it's not very actionable. I think this falls under borderline actionable because it does suggest an action (explaining the limitation) but doesn't provide concrete steps on how to fix it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review doesn't mention any specific part of the paper or the approach. It's a general comment about the system's limitation. Since it doesn't pinpoint where the issue is, it's not grounded. It's more of a vague observation rather than addressing a specific section or element. So, this should be not grounded.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a statement expressing a feeling about the system's capability. There's no justification or evidence provided. It's just an opinion, so it doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability. It's more of a subjective judgment without supporting references or logical reasoning.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is asking for an explanation of a limitation but doesn't provide any specific suggestions or details on how to generalize the approach. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue, but it's vague and lacks actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the metrics are suitable for the datasets but not for settings without task boundaries. It suggests the authors should consider alternative metrics. This is explicit, so it's not implicit. However, it doesn't specify how to implement this, like suggesting specific alternatives or providing examples. So it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail. I think this is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about metrics not being applicable without known task boundaries. It doesn't explicitly name a section or provide a unique reference, so it's not fully grounded. But it does imply the need to consider task boundaries, which is somewhat specific. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the metrics aren't suitable without task boundaries but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's vague, so it's not fully verifiable. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a suggestion but it's quite vague. It doesn't specify what alternative metrics to use or why they're better. It's helpful in pointing out a limitation but lacks depth. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. A 3 seems appropriate here too.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The ablations seem to deserve better experiment setup, as so many questions arise.\" It mentions that the ablation experiments need better setup but doesn't specify what exactly should be changed or how to implement it. So, it's an implicit action, which means the authors have to infer how to improve their setup. Since it's not explicit, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it hints at an action but doesn't provide details, so I'll give it a 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about ablation experiments needing better setup but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is wrong. It's vague about where the issues are. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint the exact area. It's not fully grounded, so I'll rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the ablation experiments need better setup but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That gives it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that the ablation experiments need better setup but doesn't offer specific suggestions or explain why this improvement is necessary. It's somewhat vague, so while it's helpful, it's not the most helpful. I'll rate this as a 3 because it provides some insight but lacks depth.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 2, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the error analysis is missing and suggests that other researchers need to know the failing cases. It's explicit about the issue but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They need to figure out what data to include. So, it's not fully actionable because the action isn't clearly stated. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out the missing error analysis but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. That means it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the problem but doesn't clearly identify the section.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the model fails in certain cases but doesn't provide any evidence or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting it, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear about the missing information and its importance for other researchers. It does provide a reason why the error analysis is needed, so it's somewhat helpful. It's not the most detailed, but it's better than nothing. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that's a solid breakdown. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and I considered borderline cases where the review could be seen as partially applicable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says there's a lack of a separate subsection for inference strategies. It's pointing out that the current approach doesn't explain how to use the multiple prompts in the test stage. Now, for actionability, I need to see if this comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is suggesting adding a subsection, which is a clear action. But the comment doesn't tell the authors exactly where to add it or how to implement it. It's more of a suggestion without specifics. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for an action but vague on the details. That would fall under **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment is about adding a subsection, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be included. It's a general suggestion without pinpointing the exact area. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion about the structure of the paper. There's no claim here; it's just stating a problem and offering a solution. Since there's no claim, it doesn't require verification. So, it's classified as **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a clear omission in the current structure. This should help the authors improve their paper by suggesting where to add more details. It's a constructive comment that provides a specific area for improvement. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because while it's helpful, it could be more detailed, but it's still valuable.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"I wonder why the results are so low using only ML in the ablation experiments.\" The author is expressing a question but isn't giving any specific action or suggestion. They mention that the results are lower than some methods but don't provide any concrete steps to improve. So, this is more of a clarifying question rather than a directive action. Since it's not giving a clear action, it's borderline actionable. I think a 2 here because it's not fully actionable but not completely unactionable either.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the results being low and compares them to other methods. However, it doesn't specify which part of the paper or results it's referring to. The mention of \"ablation experiments\" is a bit vague. They're comparing to specific methods, but without pointing out exactly where the issue lies in the paper. So, it's not fully grounded because it's not clearly pinpointing the section or figure. Maybe a 3 since it's not fully grounded but there's some implied reference.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the results are low and that other methods perform better. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for why this is the case. The reviewer is making a judgment but isn't backing it up with data or references. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing provided. I'd label this as X since there's no claim with justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question and making a comparison but isn't providing actionable suggestions. It's more of a comment that raises a point without giving clear guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. Maybe a 3 because it does touch on an improvement area but lacks depth and direction.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores make sense based on the aspects evaluated.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors mentioned limitations but should provide a detailed plan on how to address them in the future. It explicitly states an action (provide a detailed plan) and explains how to do it, so that's concrete. But it doesn't tell them exactly what to write in their future work, so it's not fully actionable. I think this is a 3 because it's explicit but vague on the specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"a detailed plan\" but doesn't specify where or how this plan should be detailed. It's not pointing to a specific part of the paper, so it's weakly grounded. Since it's not pinpointing a section or figure, it's not fully grounded. I'd rate this a 3 because it's somewhat grounded but lacks specific details.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It's just telling the authors what to do, not explaining why or providing references. So it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review gives a clear suggestion on what the authors should do in their future work. It's actionable and provides a direction, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it's helpful but could be more comprehensive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Similar methods have already been proposed for multi-task learning and has not been discussed in this paper [1].\" The first thing I notice is that it mentions an existing method but doesn't specify what needs to be done next. It's pointing out a potential area for discussion but doesn't give explicit instructions on how to improve the paper. So, it's not giving clear actions for the authors to take. That makes me think it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do after reading this. So, I'd rate actionability as 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about \"similar methods\" and \"multi-task learning\" but doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper. It's a bit vague. It doesn't mention a particular section, table, or figure, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. Also, it doesn't provide specific examples or details about what's missing. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review states that similar methods exist but references a source. However, it doesn't explain why this is relevant or how it affects the paper. There's no logical reasoning or justification provided. It just mentions the reference without supporting the claim. So, the verifiability is low because there's no solid evidence backing up the statement. This means verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out that someone else has done similar work but doesn't tell the authors how to improve their paper. It doesn't offer actionable steps or specific advice. Without clear guidance, the authors won't know what changes to make. So, the review isn't very helpful because it lacks detailed suggestions. Therefore, helpfulness is 1.\n\nIn summary, all four aspects are rated as 1 because the review lacks explicit actions, clear grounding, sufficient justification, and helpful suggestions for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It is expected that the amount of computation of FedMITR is higher than other methods. Have you compared this?\" The first thing I notice is that the reviewer is pointing out an expectation or assumption about FedMITR's computation requirements. They're asking if the author has compared this, which is a good start because it's a specific action (comparing FedMITR to other methods). However, the action isn't very explicit. The reviewer is implying that FedMITR's computation is higher, but they don't specify what exactly needs to be compared or how. So, it's an implicit action, which might be a bit vague. According to the criteria, explicit actions are better because they tell the author exactly what to do. Since this is implicit, it's not fully actionable. So, I'd rate this as **2: Borderline Actionable** because it does suggest an action but isn't entirely clear on how to proceed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions FedMITR's computation but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. They don't provide a section number, table, or any unique element of the paper. They're just making a general comment. Since the author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is, the grounding is weak. The comment doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed, so it's not fully grounded. Therefore, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clear where the problem lies, but it's somewhat specific in that it's about FedMITR's computation.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The reviewer is asking if the author has compared FedMITR to other methods. This is a claim because they're suggesting that FedMITR's computation is higher, which is an opinion or judgment. Now, is this claim supported? The reviewer is asking a question, which is a form of suggestion, but they're not providing any evidence or justification. They're just posing a question, which doesn't really provide any backing. So, the verifiability is low. It's not fully supported by reasoning, references, or external sources. Therefore, this should be **X: No Claim** because the reviewer isn't providing any evidence to back up their suggestion.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking if the author has compared FedMITR to other methods. While this is a good question, it's quite vague. The reviewer isn't providing any specific feedback or suggestions beyond asking this question. It doesn't tell the author what to do next or why this comparison is important. Without more context or guidance, the authors might not know how to improve their work based on this feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does provide a direction but isn't detailed enough to be fully helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the review point has borderline actionability, weak grounding, no verifiability, and moderate helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

However, the writing is too confusing, and I cannot be sure if that is the case or not.\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that (1) and (2) can be avoided by using an external knowledge base, referencing Figure 3. It also says the writing is too confusing and the author isn't sure. For actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The first part suggests using an external knowledge base, which is an action, but the second part is vague about the writing issue. So, it's partially actionable but not fully explicit. I think this is borderline actionable because it hints at an action but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to (1) and (2) but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper they are talking about. It also mentions writing being confusing but doesn't specify what needs fixing. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact section or issue. It's more general, so I'd rate this as weakly grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that using an external knowledge base can avoid (1) and (2). It also states that the writing is confusing. The first part could be supported by external references, so that's verifiable. The second part is a general statement about writing being confusing, which is more subjective and lacks specific justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable because part of it is supported, but not entirely.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review offers some suggestions but they're vague. It suggests using an external knowledge base and points out unclear writing. However, it doesn't provide specific steps or detailed advice on how to improve these areas. So, while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed or actionable. I think this falls under somewhat helpful because it does provide some guidance but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is only partially meeting the criteria, so the scores are all 1 except helpfulness which is 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

It's well-supported but doesn't provide examples or references. So, it's **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear and directs the authors to relevant areas, offering meaningful feedback. It's helpful but could be more detailed.

The review says, \"the model has many components whose hyper parameters are not fully provided (someone may have to trace them in the source code).\" The explicit action here is pointing out that hyperparameters aren't fully provided. However, the suggestion is vague because it tells the authors to trace them in the source code, which isn't very specific on how to do that. So, it's an explicit action but lacks detail on implementation, making it borderline actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It just mentions the model's components without pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. Also, it's not specific about what needs fixing, so it's not grounded and not specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that hyperparameters aren't fully provided. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for this judgment. It's just a statement without backing, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Is it stable to train the deep localization network with the differentiable Sinkhorn? I wish to see some training losses.\" The first part is a question, which is an implicit action. The second part is a wish, which doesn't provide specific instructions. So, it's not explicit. Since the action is vague, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to a specific part of the paper\u2014training a deep localization network using Sinkhorn. It mentions \"training losses,\" which is a specific aspect. However, the grounding is weak because it's not explicitly stated which part is being discussed. It's implied but not clearly specified. So, I'd give it a 1 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a question and a wish. There's no claim or suggestion made, just a request for information. So, there's no verifiable content here. It's not helpful in terms of providing evidence or reasoning, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is a question and a wish without any constructive feedback. It doesn't guide the authors on how to improve their work. So, it's not helpful at all. I'll rate this as 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper overclaims the strength of the BC loss in theoretical analysis. It points out that several concepts are the same but from different viewpoints. However, it doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They might need to reorganize their paper or clarify their claims. Since the action isn't clearly stated, it's not fully actionable. So, I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific concepts like geometric interpretability, theorem 1, and so on. It mentions how these are different viewpoints of the same idea. This clearly points to specific parts of the paper, so the grounding is strong. It's fully grounded because it accurately identifies the referenced parts, and it's specific because it explains the relationship between these concepts. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that these concepts are the same from different viewpoints. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. Without justification, it's hard to verify the claim's validity. So, this is borderline verifiable, which I'll rate as 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify an issue and suggests a possible improvement by pointing out redundancies. However, it doesn't offer detailed guidance on how to fix it or what changes to make. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. So, a 4 seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The proposed method may be less relevant to the authors' motivations in abstract section (automatic scores are not effective and human evaluation scores are not affordable). Since the proposed framework FFAEVAL and some similar framework like Chatbot Arena are used to do comparison between dialogue systems, I do not think it can be directly used to evaluate a single dialogue system, like give a fluency score or something like that. So these arena-based evaluation systems may not solve the problems of current score-based evaluation systems.\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the proposed method is less relevant to the authors' motivations in the abstract section because automatic scores aren't effective and human evaluation is costly. It also talks about FFAEVAL and similar frameworks not being suitable for evaluating single dialogue systems. The reviewer is suggesting that these arena-based systems can't solve the problems of current score-based systems. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a limitation but isn't suggesting a specific action or improvement. They're making a judgment about the relevance and effectiveness of certain methods. So, it's a judgment without providing a clear next step. Therefore, it's not very actionable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about automatic scores and human evaluation, which are general comments. They don't specify which part of the paper they're referring to, like the abstract or the methodology. So, the grounding isn't specific because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. They mention general areas but don't clearly identify a specific section. So, this is weak grounding. Maybe a 3 or 4? Since they don't clearly identify the part, it's probably a 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that automatic scores aren't effective and human evaluation is costly. They also suggest that arena-based systems aren't suitable. But do they back these claims with evidence or reasoning? They don't provide specific references or logical reasoning. They're just stating their opinions. So, it's not very verifiable. Maybe a 2 or 3? Since they don't support their claims, it's probably a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out limitations and suggesting that certain methods aren't suitable. While this provides some insight, it's quite vague. They don't offer specific suggestions or improvements. It's more of a critique without actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Maybe a 3 or 4? Since it's not entirely helpful but provides some value, a 3 seems right.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 1 (Unactionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 3 (Weakly Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: 3 (Somewhat Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n\nBut wait, for grounding specificity, the reviewer didn't specify which part they're talking about, so it's weakly grounded. For verifiability, they didn't back up their claims, so it's somewhat verifiable. Actionability is low because they didn't suggest any specific actions. Helpfulness is somewhat helpful because they pointed out issues but didn't offer clear solutions.\n\nSo, the final scores should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review mentions how the method scales, but it's pretty vague. It doesn't give specific actions or how to apply this information. So, it's not explicit or concrete. That means it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review talks about scaling but doesn't specify which part of the paper or method it's referring to. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue lies. That means it's not grounded at all. So, grounding specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just states that the method scales, but there's no explanation or references. So, it's unverifiable. That gives it a score of 1 in verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is vague and doesn't offer specific suggestions or actionable feedback. It's just a general statement about scalability without any meaningful insights or guidance. So, it's not helpful at all. That makes helpfulness a 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all these aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using RoBERTa-base instead of BERT. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it doesn't give any details on how to implement this change, like suggesting specific modifications or explaining why RoBERTa-base is better. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done, but it's vague on how to apply it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions RoBERTa-base but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's just a general suggestion without pointing to a specific section or issue. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. It's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It's just recommending a model, but there's no explanation of why it's better or references to support this claim. So, it's not verifiable at all.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and relevant, pointing out a potential improvement. However, it doesn't provide much guidance on how to apply the change or why RoBERTa-base is better. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an area for improvement, but it's not very detailed or actionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 5 (explicit but vague)\n- Grounding_specificity: 3 (weak grounding)\n- Verifiability: X (no claim)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (somewhat helpful)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"This paper does not provide the type of GPUs, and inference time when testing.\" It mentions two issues: the absence of certain GPUs and the inference time. But it doesn't specify what the author should do next. The author needs to know whether to add the GPUs or improve the inference time, but the review doesn't provide explicit instructions. So, it's not actionable because the author can't take a clear step. It's more like a problem statement without a solution, so I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"GPUs\" and \"inference time,\" but it's too vague. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or where the GPUs are mentioned. The author can't pinpoint exactly what's missing. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the section or part of the paper being addressed. Therefore, this is also 1 (Not Grounded).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the paper lacks specific GPUs and has an inference time issue. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no explanation of why this is a problem or how it affects the paper. So, the claim is unsupported, making it unverifiable. Thus, this is 1 (Unverifiable).\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out two issues but doesn't offer any solutions or guidance on how to fix them. It's just a list of problems without actionable steps. Since the authors don't know what to do next, the review isn't helpful. So, this is 1 (Not Helpful).\n\nOverall, the review is lacking in all four aspects, so each gets a 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests connecting the Perceptual Metric in Figure 2, but it's a bit vague. It says the Perceptual Metric should connect the Second Inpainted Images with the Inpainted Image but not the Images Masked by Second Masks. The action is clear\u2014connecting specific images\u2014but the method isn't detailed. So, it's explicit about what needs to be done but lacks specifics on how to connect them. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** (label 3).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Figure 2 and mentions specific elements like the Second Inpainted Images and Images Masked by Second Masks. It's clear which parts of the figure are being addressed, so the grounding is strong. Also, it specifies what needs to be changed, which adds specificity. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific** (label 3).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any justification or evidence. It tells the authors what to do but doesn't explain why or how it's beneficial. There's no reference to external studies or common practices, so it's just a claim without support. That makes it **Unverifiable** (label 1).\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues and suggests a change, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any rationale or evidence for why the change is necessary or beneficial. It's clear and actionable, but lacks depth, so it's **Somewhat Helpful** (label 3).\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

It's explicit about the question, so that's good. However, it doesn't tell the author exactly how to modify their code or where to look in their codebase. So it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable,\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to adaptive gradient methods and hard features but doesn't specify which part of the paper or code this relates to. It's a bit vague, but it does point to a specific area (weights) without being too vague. I'm leaning towards \"Weakly Grounded and Specific,\" which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim about whether adaptive methods could affect findings. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's just a statement without justification, so it's \"Unverifiable\" with a score of 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment raises a relevant point but doesn't provide much guidance. It's clear and raises a concern, but without specifics, it's only somewhat helpful. So I'll give it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the experiments are not sufficient and points out specific issues like limited teacher architectures and most methods being before 2019. It also references a table. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out problems but doesn't specify how to fix them. They mention types of architectures but don't suggest alternatives or improvements. So, it's not explicit on actions, making it borderline actionable. I think a 1 here because it's unclear on how to improve.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about limited teacher architectures and methods before 2019. It references a table, which is specific. However, it doesn't clearly explain what's wrong with the current setup or how to address those issues. So, while it's grounded by mentioning a table, it's not very specific about the changes needed. I'd rate this a 3 because it's somewhat grounded but lacks detail on specific fixes.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the experiments are insufficient and lists reasons. It references a table, which adds credibility. However, the justification is vague\u2014just saying \"see Tab.\" without explaining why the table supports the claim. There's some support, but it's not detailed enough. So, it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out issues and references data, which is helpful. However, it doesn't suggest specific improvements or how to address the mentioned points. It's clear that the experiments are lacking but lacks concrete advice on what to do next. So, it's somewhat helpful, probably a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own level of helpfulness and detail, leading to the scores I assigned.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that prior knowledge isn't always available and might be inaccurate, which is a valid point. But it doesn't specify what the authors should do next. They don't provide any actionable steps or solutions. So, it's not explicit because it's more of an observation than a clear instruction. It's also vague because it doesn't give any concrete advice. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it hints at a problem but doesn't tell them how to fix it. So, I'll give it a 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about prior knowledge not being available or accurate, but it doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper. It's a general concern without pinning down where exactly the issue is. So, the grounding is weak because it's not specific enough. However, it does mention what's wrong, which is specificity. So, I'll rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that prior knowledge isn't always available and might be inaccurate. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it's not fully verifiable because there's no supporting data. I'll give it a 3 here as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a practical concern but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions. It's more of a critique than a helpful comment. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nOverall, the review is somewhat helpful but could improve by being more specific and providing actionable steps.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
