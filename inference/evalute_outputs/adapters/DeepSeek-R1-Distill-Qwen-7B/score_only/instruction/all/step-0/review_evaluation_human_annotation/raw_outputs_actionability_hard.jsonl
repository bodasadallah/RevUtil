Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests a method for identifying antecedents when the prediction is a pronoun. It mentions that the authors' method involves matching the head of noun phrases but isn't clear when the head word isn't a pronoun. I think this is an explicit action because it directly points out a potential issue with the method. However, it doesn't provide a specific solution or how to handle that situation. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to address the lack of clarity. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the authors' method by mentioning the head of noun phrases but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper or what section they're talking about. It's a bit vague. Since it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed, it's not fully grounded. But it's not so weak that it's not grounded at all either. So, I'd rate this a 4 for grounding_specificity because it attempts to pinpoint the issue but isn't entirely clear.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the authors' method isn't clear when the head word isn't a pronoun. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's just a statement without any backing, so it doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability. That would be a 1 since it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a specific issue with the authors' method, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer a solution or suggest how to improve it. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies a problem, but it's incomplete. So, a 3 seems appropriate here as it's somewhat helpful but could be more comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 4, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says it's a straightforward extension of existing retrofitting work and suggests adding some additional baselines like character embeddings. The action here is clear: add baselines. But the instruction on how to do this isn't explicit. It just mentions \"some additional baselines,\" which is vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the user doesn't know exactly what steps to take. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions adding baselines but doesn't specify which part of the paper or exactly what needs to be done. It's too vague. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint where the issue is. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting adding baselines but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is a good idea. It's just a suggestion without backing, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a limitation and suggests an improvement, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is quite vague, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that it's easier to show attention in seq2seq MTL isn't working and instead focuses on changing the attention mechanism. It doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done or how to implement the change. So, it's not giving clear actions. I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it mentions an action (changing the mechanism) but doesn't provide details.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about why attention isn't working but doesn't reference any specific part of the paper. It's too vague about which section or element is causing the issue. So, it's not fully grounded. I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the problem but doesn't pinpoint the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why changing the attention mechanism would help. It just suggests it without backing it up. So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has a claim (implying the change is useful) but lacks justification or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is somewhat vague and doesn't give clear guidance. It suggests a change but doesn't explain why it's beneficial or how to do it. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does offer a suggestion but isn't very detailed or clear.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated 3 because they all have some elements but lack the necessary details or grounding.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"A number of claims from this paper would benefit from more in-depth analysis.\" Hmm, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out that some claims need more analysis but doesn't specify which ones or how to do that. So, it's not explicit, which would make it implicit. Since it's not explicit, it's probably low on actionability. I think this is borderline actionable because it suggests an action but doesn't give details, so maybe a 1 or 2. But since it's not explicit, I'll go with 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This looks at whether the review clearly references specific parts of the paper. The comment doesn't mention any specific sections, tables, or figures. It just says claims need more analysis. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint where the issue is. It's not grounded at all, so I'd rate this as 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that some claims need more analysis. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is necessary. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does suggest that claims need more analysis, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't specify how or why. It's not very detailed, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful. I think a 1 is appropriate here because it's not providing substantial guidance.\n\nSo, putting it all together, all four aspects are labeled as 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests modifying the substructure to be a sequence of words and questions whether \"knowledge\" is appropriate. It gives clear instructions on what to do, so that's explicit. The actions are also concrete because it tells exactly how to change the substructure and what not to use. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions specific parts like the substructure needing to be a sequence of words and questions about the term \"knowledge\". They also imply the use of AMR parsing. This is pretty specific, so I think it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer provides clear reasoning about why the substructure should be a sequence of words and questions about terminology. They don't cite external references, but their explanations are logical and precise. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and actionable, suggesting specific changes and addressing concerns about terminology. It's helpful because it guides the authors on what to do and what not to use. It's not the most detailed, but it's definitely helpful. So, a 5 seems right.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"However, there is no corresponding set of tools for the reinforcement learning setting.\" It mentions that this is false and cites some references. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a deficiency but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. They suggest looking at references, but that's not an explicit action. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what to do. Maybe they should add tools or cite existing ones. Since it's not clear, I'd rate this as 1, which is unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is. The reviewer mentions reinforcement learning but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is missing. They just say there's no corresponding set of tools. Without pointing to a specific section or issue, it's not fully grounded. So, I'd give this a 3, which is weak grounding with some specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer claims that there's no corresponding set of tools but then says it's false and provides references. So, there's a claim here, and it's supported by external references. That makes it somewhat verifiable. I don't think it's fully verifiable because the references are only in the submitted paper, which might not be well-known. So, I'll rate this as 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer points out a deficiency and provides references, which is helpful. However, they don't suggest specific improvements, like adding tools or citing existing ones. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the method is compared with other methods, but it's vague about what exactly is being compared. It also talks about potential societal impacts but doesn't specify how to address them. So, it's not giving clear actions for the authors to take. I think this is somewhat actionable but not very specific, so maybe a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to comparing with other methods but doesn't pin down exactly which ones. It also mentions societal impacts without pointing to specific sections or elements of the paper. The grounding here is weak because it's not clearly identifying the specific part of the paper being discussed.

It's making claims without justification, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that Section 4 is written very tersely and could use a slower development for readability. It mentions the issue but doesn't provide specific steps on how to improve it. So, it's explicit in pointing out the problem but doesn't give actionable advice. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know there's a problem, but they don't know exactly what to do. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Section 4 without specifying which part exactly. It just says \"Section 4\" and mentions the need for slower development. Since it doesn't point out a specific element or table, the grounding is weak. However, it does identify the area, so it's not completely ungrounded. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that Section 4 is too terse and could use more development. But it doesn't provide any evidence or references to support this claim. It's just an opinion without backing, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that Section 4 is too concise and suggests it needs more development for readability.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the pipeline method doesn't give better results for both datasets. It mentions baseline models aren't well introduced. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer points out a problem but doesn't specify how to fix it. They don't tell the authors what changes to make or how to improve their models. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. I'd rate this as 1 because it's unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is. The reviewer talks about the pipeline not performing well but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model needs improvement. They mention baseline models but don't point to a particular section or issue. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the problem is. I think this is a 3 because it's somewhat grounded but not fully specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the pipeline doesn't perform better and that baseline models aren't well introduced. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for why this is the case. The reviewer doesn't explain why the pipeline fails or why the baseline isn't well introduced. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing for the claims made. This would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out issues, but it's vague. It tells the authors that their method isn't working well but doesn't offer specific suggestions or explain why. Without clear guidance, the authors might not know how to proceed. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. I'd rate this a 3 because it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n\nOverall, the review lacks explicit instructions, doesn't clearly identify the problem, provides no justification, and doesn't offer detailed guidance. Each aspect reflects that the review isn't very helpful or specific.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors have reproduced a known result using a coarse methodology. It mentions that this observation isn't new and has been made before. The comment seems to suggest that the authors shouldn't be making this claim again. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next or how to improve their methodology. It's more of a statement pointing out that their work isn't adding anything new, but it doesn't give clear steps on how to address this. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what specific changes to make. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to a \"coarse\" methodology but doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper or what exactly is being criticized. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where the issue lies because the comment doesn't pin down the specific section or figure. So, it's not fully grounded because the authors can't pinpoint the exact area needing improvement. I think this is a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the authors have reproduced a known result, which is a judgment about their work. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or justification for this claim. It just states that it's unclear why this observation needs to be made again. There's no supporting reasoning or references, so it's not very verifiable. I'd give this a 3 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that the authors have done something others have already done, which might be helpful in highlighting redundancy. However, it's quite vague and doesn't suggest specific improvements. It doesn't really guide the authors on what changes to make or how to address this issue. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very detailed or actionable. I'd rate this a 3 for helpfulness.\n\nOverall, the review is somewhat helpful but lacks specific guidance and justification, making it not highly actionable or verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Theorem 1 and 2 prove that GCL conforms to a clearer community structure via intra-community concentration and inter-community scatter, but its relationship with degree bias is not intuitive enough.\n\nLet's evaluate each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\n- The review points out that Theorem 1 and 2 prove something, but it doesn't explicitly tell the authors how to get a small degree of bias. It suggests that more explanations are needed but doesn't provide concrete steps or methods. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but vague on how to implement it.\n\n**Grounding Specificity:**\n- The review explicitly mentions Theorem 1 and 2 and clearly states what needs to be addressed (the relationship with degree bias). It provides specific references to the theorems, making it fully grounded and specific.\n\n**Verifiability:**\n- The claim is that more explanations are needed, which is a subjective opinion. There's no supporting evidence or justification provided, so it's unverifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\n- The review provides some suggestions but lacks clarity and depth.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the split between static and temporal features into two variables is confusing because the paper doesn't provide enough information about what S and Xt are. The reviewer suggests that more details are needed. This is an explicit action because they're pointing out a specific issue and suggesting a change. However, the suggestion is quite vague because it doesn't specify how to define S and Xt or where to find that information. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to address the issue. Therefore, this should be a **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer refers to the paper by name, which is a specific part, and mentions the variables S and Xt, which are specific elements within the paper. They clearly identify the issue without making general comments. So, this has strong grounding because they pinpoint the section and the variables. The specificity is high because they explain what needs to be addressed. Thus, this should be a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the paper doesn't provide enough information about S and Xt. They don't support this claim with any evidence or references. It's just a statement without justification. Therefore, this is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides a clear point about the confusion caused by the lack of information on S and Xt. They suggest that more details are needed, which is helpful for the authors. However, the suggestion is vague, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. So, this should be a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It also mentions the method used there, which helps the author understand what to do.

This is because the comment does not explicitly state an action or provide clear guidance on how to sample from the DPP. Instead, it raises a concern about the clarity of the method and compares it to another problem, leaving the authors uncertain about the next steps.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that for sequential ensembling, it's important to study noise accumulation in homomorphic encryption, and this limitation prevents using even single deep neural networks on homomorphically encrypted data. The comment is pointing out a limitation, but it's more of a statement rather than an explicit action. The authors aren't told exactly what to do, just that there's a problem. So, it's not actionable because it doesn't guide them on how to fix it. I think this is unactionable, so a score of 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions homomorphic encryption and noise accumulation but doesn't specify exactly where or how this applies. It's too vague about pinpointing the part of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the issue. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific, giving it a score of 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests that using single deep neural networks on homomorphically encrypted data is a limitation.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"First of all, to compare the obtained complexity for the proposed method with the previous result in a strongly-convex concave case, it should be used standard regularization trick.\" Hmm, it's giving a suggestion to use a standard regularization trick for comparison. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It says \"should be used,\" which is a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly how to implement this. So, it's not explicit. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it suggests an action but doesn't provide detailed steps. So, I'd give it a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"a strongly-convex concave case.\" Is this specific enough? The authors might not know exactly which part of the paper this refers to. It's a bit vague. So, it's not fully grounded because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a suggestion to use a standard regularization trick. Is this claim supported by evidence? Well, standard regularization tricks are common knowledge in machine learning, so it's justified by well-known practices. However, it's not providing a specific reference or detailed reasoning, so it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe a 3? Wait, no, the definitions say 3 is somewhat specific but not clear. Wait, no, verifiability is about how well the claim is justified. Since it's using common knowledge, it's somewhat verifiable. So, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is suggesting a method to compare complexities but doesn't explain why this is important or how it helps. It's vague and doesn't provide much depth. So, it's not very helpful. Maybe a 1.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, I'm a bit confused. The claim is to use a standard regularization trick, which is justified by common knowledge. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's based on established methods, but it's not fully verifiable because it doesn't cite specific literature. So, maybe a 3. But according to the scale, 3 is somewhat verifiable. Hmm, but the comment is clear about the suggestion, so maybe it's 3. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's 4 because it's somewhat justified but lacks specific references. Wait, no, the scale says 3 is somewhat verifiable, 4 is mostly, and 5 is fully. Since it's using common knowledge, it's somewhat, so 3.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that ICL-HAR improves consistency and verifiability but hinders accuracy scores. It suggests discussing or acknowledging this in the main text. The action here is clear: the authors should address this issue. However, the instruction on how to improve accuracy isn't provided, making it vague. So, it's not fully actionable but has an explicit action. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nFor **Grounding_specificity**, the review refers to ICL-HAR by name, which is specific. It also mentions accuracy scores, which is a specific part of the paper. The grounding is clear, so this should be a higher score. I'll give it a 3.\n\n**Verifiability** involves whether the claim is supported. The review states that accuracy scores dropped from 70.4 to 55.6. This is a factual claim. It doesn't provide evidence or reasoning, so it's not fully verifiable. I'll rate this as 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers some feedback but lacks depth. It suggests improvements without specifics, making it somewhat helpful but not the most helpful. I'll rate this as 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated 3 because they either have explicit actions but lack detail, clear grounding, factual claims without justification, or partial helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper has writing issues like grammatical errors and unclear sentences. It doesn't specify what needs to be done, like suggesting corrections or pointing out specific errors. Without explicit actions, the authors don't know how to improve. So, this is unactionable because there's no clear guidance on how to fix the issues mentioned.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions writing issues but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It's too vague, so the authors can't identify where exactly the problems are. This means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly reference the paper's sections or specific elements.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that there are issues but doesn't provide any evidence or justification. It's just a general claim without supporting references or logical reasoning. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing to make the claim credible.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out problems but doesn't offer any suggestions or guidance on how to address them. It's just a critique without actionable steps, making it not helpful for the authors to improve their work.\n\nSo, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because they're all unhelpful, ungrounded, unverifiable, and unactionable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

It's a bit vague because it doesn't specify how the method could be applied elsewhere. So, it's not explicit enough, which would make it borderline actionable. Since it's not clear on how to implement the suggestion, I'd rate it as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"other NLP tasks\" but doesn't pin down which ones or how. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. Therefore, it's a 3 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why exploring other tasks would limit generalizability. It's just a statement without backing, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is somewhat helpful because it points out a limitation, but it's vague and lacks specifics. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't tell them how to fix it. That makes it somewhat actionable because they know there's a problem, but they don't know how to address it. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"certificate\" at line 267. Without more context, it's a bit vague about which part of the paper is affected. It doesn't clearly point to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinning down exactly where the issue is. But it's not completely vague either. Maybe it's a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests that \"certificate\" might be misinterpreted. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement that something could be misinterpreted without backing it up. So, it's not very verifiable. Maybe a 3 here as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify a potential issue with terminology but doesn't offer specific suggestions or explain why it's problematic. It's clear that the terminology is confusing, but without actionable steps, it's somewhat helpful. So, a 3 seems appropriate.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated a 3 because they either provide some information but lack the depth or specifics needed for full effectiveness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the experiments are limited to toy data and suggests looking at real data. The action here is clear: the authors should consider expanding their experiments. But the review doesn't specify how to implement this, like suggesting specific real data sets or methods. So it's explicit in pointing out the need for change but lacks detail on how to do it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about toy data and real data. It doesn't mention specific sections, tables, or figures, but it does point out a general limitation. The grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing an exact part of the paper. However, it does suggest an improvement area, so it's not completely ungrounded. I'd rate this **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that toy data is limiting and suggests real data. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's a bit vague, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the limitations and suggests an improvement. It gives the authors a direction to take, which is helpful. While it doesn't go into detail, it's enough to guide them.

However, it doesn't provide explicit guidance on how to implement this. The suggestion is vague, leaving the authors uncertain about the exact steps to take. Therefore, it's borderline actionable.  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label (5):**  \n   The review explicitly mentions Eq.(1) and Algorithm 1, providing clear grounding. It also specifies the reformulation's implications, making it highly specific.  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label (3):**  \n   The claim is that the prox-linear subproblem can be reformulated using the conjugate function. While the reasoning is logical, it lacks specific references or examples, making it somewhat verifiable.  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label (3):**  \n   The review provides a clear claim and some justification, but it's incomplete.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I remember that it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The review says, \"Make the captions more descriptive. It's annoying to have to search through the text for your interpretation of the figures, which is usually on a different page 4. Explain the scramble network better...\" \n\nThe first part, \"Make the captions more descriptive,\" is explicit. It tells the author exactly what to do. The second part, \"It's annoying to have to search through the text for your interpretation of the figures, which is usually on a different page 4,\" is a bit vague. It suggests a problem but doesn't specify how to fix it. The third part, \"Explain the scramble network better,\" is also vague and doesn't provide a clear action. So, this review has an explicit action but lacks detail on how to implement it. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** (label 3).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity** looks at how specific the review is about the paper's parts. The review mentions captions and figures but doesn't specify which figure or caption. It also refers to a \"scramble network\" without any context. Since it's not pinpointing a specific part, the grounding is weak. However, it does explain the issues with those parts, so it's not completely ungrounded. This would be **Weakly Grounded and Specific** (label 3).\n\nFor **verifiability**, I need to check if there are any claims and how they're supported. The review doesn't make any opinions or judgments; it's more of a suggestion. There's no claim here, so it falls under \"X: No Claim.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness** assesses how useful the review is. The suggestions are clear but lack depth. They point out specific issues without providing detailed guidance. While helpful, it's not the most detailed feedback, so it's **Somewhat Helpful** (label 3).\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a score based on the evaluation.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the images are randomly sampled CIFAR images, which makes the task harder. It asks why this particular difficulty is interesting. The action here is asking a question, but it's not giving a direct instruction on what to do. It's more of a clarifying question, so I think it's borderline actionable. It's not vague, but it doesn't provide explicit steps on how to improve. So I'd rate it as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions CIFAR images but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is being discussed. It's a bit vague, but it does imply the relevance of the images. So I think it's weakly grounded because it's not pinpointing a specific section but is still clear enough about the issue. The specificity about what's wrong is good, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that this choice is not well motivated. It's a subjective opinion, so it's a claim. But there's no supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement without justification, so it's unverifiable. I'll score it as 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question rather than providing suggestions. It's not directly helpful because authors need actionable feedback, not just questions. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully, so I'll give it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that there's an existing detector, PhaseNet-Das, and suggests that the authors should compare their method against it. It also recommends showing a future application. The comment is explicit about the actions: comparing and justifying the benefit. It doesn't just say \"improve,\" but actually tells the authors what to do. So that's pretty actionable. I think this should be a 5 because it's explicit and gives clear directions.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review points out an existing detector but doesn't specify which one exactly. It just mentions PhaseNet-Das and says there might be others. So the grounding is a bit weak because it's not pinpointing the exact reference. However, it does imply the existence of others, which is better than not mentioning it at all. So I'd rate this as 4 because it's not fully grounded but shows an understanding.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests comparing against an existing detector and justifying the benefit. It doesn't provide specific references or examples, but it's clear that the authors need to do this. So it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the depth needed for full verifiability. I think a 3 is appropriate here because there's some justification but not enough detail.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a specific area for improvement\u2014comparing with an existing method and justifying the benefit. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful. It doesn't go into too much detail, but it's enough to guide the authors. So I'd rate this as 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nOverall, the review is quite good but could benefit from more specifics in grounding and verifiability to make it even more actionable and helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It's more of a question than a suggestion, so it's not explicit. Since it's vague, it's not highly actionable. I think it's a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions triplets and sliding windows but doesn't tie it directly to the paper's content. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. But it does imply a specific part of the methodology, so maybe it's a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a question without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question but doesn't offer any solutions or further explanation.

It also mentions that there's missing related work but doesn't specify how to address that. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The comment is explicit because it directly addresses the term and the two types. However, it's vague because it doesn't tell the author how to improve their work. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"related work\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It's not clearly pointing to a specific section or element, so it's only weakly grounded. But it does mention related work, which adds some specificity. I think this is a 3 because it's weakly grounded but somewhat specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment talks about related work but doesn't provide any evidence or references. It's just stating that there's missing related work without supporting it. So, it's not verifiable. I'll mark this as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does point out an area for improvement (related work) but doesn't suggest how to address it. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies a problem, but it's not fully constructive.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests distinguishing a specific phenomenon from usual statistical bounds. It's explicit because it tells the authors what to do, but it's vague because it doesn't specify how to distinguish or what methods to use. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions distinguishing from statistical bounds but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be done. It's not grounded because it's too vague. So, this should be a lower score, maybe a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification. It just suggests distinguishing something without backing it up. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is somewhat helpful because it points out an area for improvement, but it's vague and lacks specifics.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that all linear convergence rates rely on Theorem 8, which is in the appendix and the proof isn't clear. The comment is pointing out an issue, but it's not giving a direct action for the authors to take. They know there's a problem, but it doesn't tell them how to fix it. So, it's not explicit because it's more of an implication rather than a clear instruction. It's also not concrete because it doesn't specify how to address the proof's unclear nature. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at an action but doesn't provide the details. So, I'd give it a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Theorem 8 in the appendix but doesn't specify exactly where or how it's referenced. It's a bit vague about pinpointing the exact part of the paper that needs improvement. So, the grounding isn't fully there because it's not clearly identifying the section. It's more of a general statement, so it's weakly grounded. However, it does provide some specificity by mentioning the theorem, so it's not completely without specificity. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and specific, which would be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the proof isn't clear enough, which is a claim. But there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It just states the problem without backing it up. So, it's unverifiable because there's no logical reasoning or references to back it up. Hence, a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out an issue but doesn't offer a solution or suggest how to improve it. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps. So, while it's somewhat helpful in identifying a problem, it's not very helpful because it lacks guidance. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is borderline in actionability, weakly grounded but somewhat specific, unverifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The comment says that Mao et al., 2020, used ADMM with two versions, and it's not accurate to say they used simple SGD. It also points out that \"it\" in the second part doesn't have a clear reference. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment gives clear instructions. The first part mentions specific versions of ADMM and correctly identifies the inaccuracy in using SGD. The second part points out an issue but doesn't tell the author exactly how to fix it. So, it's explicit but not very detailed on how to implement the correction. I think this is **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's clear what's wrong but doesn't tell the author how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to Mao et al., 2020 by name, which is specific. It also mentions ADMM's versions and the SGD issue. The part about \"it\" not having a clear reference is a bit vague, but overall, it accurately points to specific sections or elements. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment provides specific details about ADMM versions and the SGD issue. It references a specific paper, making it well-supported. The reasoning is clear, so this is **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment points out two clear issues: the method used in Mao et al. and the unclear reference. It provides enough detail for the author to understand the problems and make improvements. While it could be expanded, it's already quite helpful. So, this is **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that BRP-NAS is somewhat barebones and only compares against three alternatives, ignoring others like super-net approaches. It gives a direct comment about the comparison but doesn't specify how to improve it. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on the exact changes needed. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment points out specific issues with BRP-NAS but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's vague about the alternatives mentioned, so the grounding is weak. It's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the alternatives but doesn't pin down the exact section.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that BRP-NAS only compares against three alternatives and ignores others. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references for this claim. It's clear that the claim is made, but there's no supporting evidence, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some critique but doesn't provide detailed suggestions or context on why BRP-NAS is limited. It's somewhat helpful but could be more comprehensive. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated as 3 because they either provide some information but lack detail or clarity in their respective categories.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the experiment results can be enriched and mentions that there are lacks in attacks with different strengths and how different thresholds influence detection performance. It doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done, like suggesting adding more attacks or providing examples of different thresholds. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issues but doesn't give clear instructions on how to fix them. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear there's a problem but lacks detail on the solution.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"lack of attacks with different strength\" and \"lack of influence of different thresholds.\" It doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper is being referred to, like a specific section or figure. It's a bit vague, so it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does touch on the issues but doesn't pinpoint exactly where the problems are.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review talks about \"lack of attacks\" and \"influence of different thresholds.\" It doesn't provide any justification or references for these claims. It's just stating problems without supporting evidence, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but missing details.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues in the results and mentions thresholds, which are actionable points for the authors. However, it doesn't suggest exact improvements or how to address these issues. It's clear and identifies areas for improvement but lacks detailed guidance. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it gives some direction but doesn't fully empower the authors to make comprehensive changes.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the method works for digit or text images but not for natural images like CIFAR10. It's asking if the method can be extended. The comment is explicit about the limitation, so that's good. It tells the authors what's missing. However, it doesn't provide a clear solution or how to modify the method. It's more of a question than a suggestion, so it's somewhat actionable but not very detailed. I think this falls under a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific datasets like MNIST and SVHN, which are well-known, and suggests applying it to CIFAR10, a specific dataset as well. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, so that's full grounding. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, which is applying the method to a different dataset. So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the method doesn't work for natural images. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable at all, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation and asks for an extension, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete suggestions. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an area for improvement, but it's not very detailed. So, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the style is clean, but the prompts are not well-organized in Tables 6 and 7, and all sentences are squeezed together. It suggests the authors should fix the organization. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the comment tells the authors what to fix but doesn't specify how. They need to reorganize the tables and maybe break up the sentences. So, it's explicit that they should fix the organization, but it's vague on the exact steps. That sounds like a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in pointing out the part of the paper. The comment mentions Tables 6 and 7 but doesn't specify exactly what's wrong with them. It just says they're not well-organized and sentences are squeezed. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to the specific sections or issues. It's more general, so I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the prompts need organizing. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. It's just stating an opinion without backing it up. So, this is unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out specific issues the authors need to address, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into detail about how to fix them or provide concrete suggestions. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies problems, but it's not as helpful as it could be with more guidance. So, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the specific content of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It explicitly states the problems, which is an explicit action. However, it doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to fix the issues, such as suggesting alternative visualization methods or labeling techniques. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable (3)**.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Analysis**:  \n   The comment directly references Figure 2 and mentions specific elements like the relation between sub-figures and missing labels. This clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, showing strong grounding. Additionally, it specifies what needs to be addressed, enhancing specificity. Thus, it's **Fully Grounded and Specific (5)**.\n\n3. **Verifiability Analysis**:  \n   The review mentions issues with the figures but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for why the current figures are problematic or how improvements would benefit the paper. There's no reference to external studies or common practices, making it **Unverifiable (1)**.\n\n4. **Helpfulness Analysis**:  \n   The review identifies problems with the figures and suggests improvements, offering some actionable feedback. However, the suggestions are vague, and the comment doesn't elaborate on how these changes will enhance the paper.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the work uses only binary features and suggests that real-world data often has more types of features. It implies that the method might not apply to real and categorical features. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a limitation but doesn't specify how to fix it. They don't tell the authors to add categorical features or adjust their method. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's not clear on how to apply, it's probably **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't detail it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is about the paper. The reviewer mentions that real-world data is usually a mix of features but doesn't tie this directly to the paper's specific sections or methods. They're making a general comment without pointing to a particular part of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify which part is being addressed. However, they do specify that the method might not apply to other feature types, which is somewhat specific. So, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not fully grounded but does touch on a specific issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that real-world data includes more feature types. They don't provide any references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's a general statement without justification. So, it's not fully verifiable. It's more of a **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because they do make a claim, but there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't offer concrete suggestions on how to improve the method or where to look in the paper. It's clear that the method might not work for other feature types, but there's no actionable advice. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify an issue but doesn't provide enough guidance.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated a 3 because they all fall into the middle category where the review provides some information but lacks explicitness, grounding, justification, or detailed suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The comment says, \"The writing should be improved. Some points in the paper is unclear to me.\" I remember that actionability is about how clear the suggestions are and whether the authors can take them directly. Here, the reviewer mentions that some points are unclear but doesn't specify which ones or how to fix them. So, it's not giving a clear action, which means it's not actionable. I think this should be a low score, maybe 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper's parts. The comment talks about unclear points but doesn't name any sections or examples. It's too vague, so grounding is weak. I'd also give this a 1 because it's not grounded in specific parts of the paper.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that writing needs improvement, but it doesn't back this up with evidence or reasoning. It's just a statement without justification, so it's not verifiable. This should also be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does suggest improvement but is very vague. It doesn't provide specific areas or actionable steps, so it's not very helpful. I'd rate this a 1 as well.\n\nSo, all four aspects get a 1 because the comment lacks explicitness, specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using other metrics like BERTScore. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next, like how to implement these metrics or where to find more information. So, it's not giving a direct action. That makes it more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's not explicit, it's probably not highly actionable. Maybe it's somewhat actionable because it does suggest a change, but without specifics, it's probably a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions using other metrics but doesn't specify which ones or where to apply them. It's a general suggestion without pointing to a particular part of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the section or table. It's more of a general comment, so I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review talks about BERTScore but doesn't provide any evidence or references. It just suggests using it without explaining why or how it's better. So, there's no supporting justification, making it unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is to use other metrics, which is helpful because it provides a direction for improvement. However, it's quite vague and doesn't give specific steps or references. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 4 because it does offer some guidance, just not in a detailed way.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper doesn't discuss scalability bounds, memory requirements, or computational complexity. It's pointing out missing information. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The review clearly states what's missing, so that's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It says the paper lacks these discussions, but it doesn't specify how to address the issue. So, it's explicit but vague. That would fall under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what's missing but lacks detail on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"scalability bounds,\" \"memory requirements,\" and \"computational complexity.\" These are specific technical terms related to the paper's content. The authors can infer exactly where these aspects are discussed. So, the grounding is strong because it's clear which parts of the paper are being addressed. The specificity is also good because it's pointing out specific issues. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the paper lacks certain discussions. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just a statement of what's missing without any justification. So, this falls under **1: Unverifiable** because there's no supporting data or reasoning provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out specific areas where the paper is lacking, which is helpful for the authors. However, it doesn't provide any suggestions on how to improve those aspects. It's clear that the paper needs more discussion on scalability, but without guidance on what to add, the helpfulness is limited. So, this would be **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does inform the authors of the issues but doesn't offer solutions.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking a question about how the base node affects the model. It's explicit in asking for an explanation, so that's a clear action. However, it's a yes/no question without providing any specific steps or details on how to improve the model. So, it's not vague but lacks concrete instructions. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it's clear but not detailed enough.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review point refers to the base node and its effects on key nodes and model performance. It mentions specific parts of the model, so it's grounded. But the question is quite general, just asking if the base node affects ordering, attention, and performance. It doesn't specify exactly what needs to be changed or how, so it's not fully specific. I'd rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it's clear about the parts mentioned but doesn't delve deeper into the implications.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review point is a question without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It's just asking whether the base node affects certain aspects. There's no justification or references provided, so it doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability. This should be marked as \"X\" because there's no claim or supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The question is clear and relevant, pointing out a potential area for improvement. However, it's somewhat generic and doesn't provide detailed suggestions or context on how to proceed. It's helpful in that it identifies an issue but doesn't offer substantial guidance. So, I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2 (Borderline Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 3 (Weakly Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: X (No Claim)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review asks a question about the direction of an arrow in a figure. It's explicit because it directly points out a specific part of the paper (Figure 2) and what's wrong with it. However, it doesn't tell the author how to fix it. So, it's not fully actionable because the author still needs to figure out the correction themselves. That makes it a **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figure 2 and the arrow's direction, which is specific. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being discussed, so it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a question, not a claim. Since there's no claim being made, it doesn't require justification. So, it's classified as **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and points out a specific issue, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide guidance on how to fix it, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That makes it a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is clear and specific but lacks actionable steps and constructive suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that many abbreviations lack definition and provides an example by explaining what 'AR' stands for. The comment is explicit about the issue and gives a clear action, which is to define the abbreviations. It doesn't just point out the problem; it also explains how to fix it. So, this is explicit and concrete. I think this should be a higher score, maybe 4 or 5. But since it's giving a direct action and concrete details, I'll go with 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions 'AR' in Table 5 and explains what it stands for. It's specific about the part of the paper (Table 5) and clearly states what needs to be addressed. So, this has strong grounding because it accurately points to the referenced section and explains the issue there. I think this is a 4 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a clear explanation of what 'AR' stands for. It's logical and specific, so it's well-supported. There's no need for external references here because the explanation is straightforward. This should be a high score, maybe 4 or 5. Since it's thorough and logical, I'll assign 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides specific suggestions. It helps the authors by explaining the abbreviations, which is a direct improvement. It's not too vague; it gives actionable steps. So, this should be a high score. I think 4 is appropriate here because it's clear, specific, and helpful for the authors.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For actionability, it's 4 because it's explicit and concrete. Grounding is 4 because it's specific and accurate. Verifiability is 4 because it's logical and well-supported. Helpfulness is 4 because it's clear and actionable. I don't see any issues with these scores. They all seem to fit well.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using advantage instead of q-value but doesn't specify how to implement this change. It's vague, so it's not explicit. Since it doesn't provide concrete steps, it's not actionable. So, it's somewhere between 1 and 3. I think it's 3 because it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions using advantage instead of q-value but doesn't specify which part of the paper or why this change is needed. It's unclear, so it's not fully grounded. It's probably a weak ground with no specificity, so maybe a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claim or suggestion. It's just a question, so it's an \"X\" because there's no claim to verify.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for information but isn't providing actionable feedback. It's somewhat helpful but not very. So, a 3 seems right.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that VINS sets different sample weights, while other baselines set all weights to 1. This seems like a clear action, telling the authors to consider their approach. It's explicit because it directly points out a difference in their method. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it specifies that other methods use uniform weights, which gives the authors a clear direction on what to adjust. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"other compared baselines\" without pinning down exactly which ones. It doesn't mention specific sections or unique aspects of the paper. So, while it's pointing out a difference, it's not fully grounded because the authors can't pinpoint exactly which part they should change. Therefore, it's grounded but not fully specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that VINS uses different weights, but it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an observation without backing it up. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's a claim, but without support, it's not fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest a modification the authors should make, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague\u2014just saying \"consider their approach\" isn't very detailed. It could be more helpful if it provided specific guidance on how to adjust their weights or why their approach is better. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is highly actionable, grounded but not fully specific, somewhat verifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the results are presented in a convoluted way and specifically points out a safety violation in the first 1000 episodes. It says the reason for this presentation is unclear. Now, for actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit or implicit. The review does state what's wrong (safety violations) and mentions the part of the paper (first 1000 episodes), so that's explicit. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to fix it or what changes to make. It's vague on the implementation. So, it's not fully actionable because it lacks specific guidance. Therefore, it's probably a 1 for actionability since it's not fully actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the safety violations in the first 1000 episodes, which is specific. It doesn't make any general comments or guess where the issue is. So, the grounding is solid. Now, regarding specificity, the comment explains what's wrong but doesn't provide clear details on how to address it. It just says the presentation is unclear, not how to improve it. So, it's specific about the issue but not specific on the solution. That would make it a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review makes a claim that the results are presented convolutedly and specifically point out a safety issue. Now, for verifiability, we need to see if this claim is supported. The comment doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the presentation is unclear or why the safety issue is a problem. It just states the observations without backing them up. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting reasoning or references. Therefore, it's a 3 on verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues but doesn't offer concrete solutions or explain why these issues are problematic. It's clear that the presentation is unclear and that there's a safety violation, but it doesn't guide the authors on how to fix it. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully constructive.

Overall, you could have edited the space of main paper more wisely.\" I think the first part, \"The allocation of Figure 1 is too naive,\" is a suggestion, but it's vague. It doesn't tell the author exactly what to do. Then, \"you could have edited the space of main paper more wisely\" is another suggestion, but again, it's not specific. So, this is explicit but vague. I think that makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figure 1 and the main paper. It doesn't specify which part of Figure 1 is problematic or give details on what needs fixing. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact section or issue. Therefore, it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the allocation is too naive and suggesting edits. But there's no supporting evidence or references. It's just an opinion without backing. So, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification or examples provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out issues but doesn't provide concrete fixes or prioritize them. It's vague and doesn't guide the author on what exactly to change. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because there's some feedback, but it's not detailed enough.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It also says that learned methods aren't comparable to pre-defined ones. I think the comment is pointing out issues but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. It's more of a critique than a suggestion. So, it's not explicit or actionable.

Maybe a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that manual design is unrealistic and that the methods aren't comparable. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references.

It suggests looking into combination methods and recent works. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It seems like it's pointing out areas for improvement but doesn't specify actions like modifying figures or sections. So, it's not explicit. It's more vague, so I think it's borderline actionable. Maybe a 2?\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about continuous learning with unlabeled data, mentions specific methods like feature-replay, and cites papers.

It does suggest looking into specific areas, which is explicit, but it doesn't tell exactly what to do. So maybe it's 2. Grounding is definitely 3 because it's specific but not fully pinpointing.

Therefore, they are somewhat actionable.\n\n**Grounding Specificity:**\n- The review points address specific parts of the paper (ground truth and ablation study results). They clearly identify the sections being discussed, providing grounding. Additionally, they specify what needs to be addressed, making them specific. Thus, they are fully grounded and specific.\n\n**Verifiability:**\n- The review points are questions seeking clarification rather than making claims.

The reviewer does state what needs to be done\u2014change the wording\u2014but it's a bit vague. They don't specify exactly how to make the changes or where to adjust the language. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still have to figure out how to implement the suggestions. That would make it a 4 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the conclusion and multiple places in the writing. It doesn't explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures, but it does point out general areas. So, the grounding is there, but it's not as specific as it could be. It's more of a general comment without pinpointing the exact part of the paper. Therefore, it's grounded but not fully specific, which would be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the word choice is flamboyant, which is a claim. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It just says it's too exaggerated without explaining why or citing examples. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. That would be a 3 since it's somewhat verifiable but lacks key elements.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out issues and suggests changes, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the authors assumed a certain property about kernels, which is fine, but misses another class. It suggests the results might be restrictive. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is making a clear point about the limitation, so that's explicit. But does it give a direct action? The reviewer doesn't tell the authors what to do next, just points out the limitation. So it's explicit but not actionable because it doesn't tell them how to fix it. Maybe a 4?\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions Matern kernels and their polynomial decay, which is specific. They also point out that this makes the results restrictive. So the grounding is solid because they're pointing to a specific part of the paper. The specificity is good because they explain what's missing. So this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the results could be restrictive because of the kernel assumption. They don't provide evidence or references to back this up. It's a claim without support, so it's unverifiable. Maybe a 1?\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is pointing out a limitation but doesn't offer concrete suggestions on how to address it. It's clear and identifies an issue, but lacks detailed guidance. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Maybe a 4.\n\nWait, but for actionability, I thought it was explicit but not actionable. Maybe it's a 4 because it's clear but doesn't tell them how to proceed. Grounding is 5 because it's specific. Verifiability is 1 because no evidence is provided. Helpfulness is 4 because it's clear and identifies a problem, but lacks specific advice.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The writing is difficult to follow in many places and can be simplified.\" I think this is an explicit statement because it directly tells the author what needs to be done. It doesn't ask for clarification or make vague suggestions. So, it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The comment mentions that the writing is difficult to follow and suggests simplification. It doesn't tell the author exactly where the issues are or how to simplify. So, it's not very concrete. Therefore, I'd rate this as Somewhat Actionable, which is a 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review doesn't specify which part of the paper is difficult to follow. It just says \"many places.\" So, the author can't pinpoint where the problem is. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the specific section or issue. It's also not specific because it doesn't explain what needs to be simplified. So, this should be Weakly Grounded and Not Specific, which is a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the writing is difficult to follow. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a statement without any backing. So, it's not verifiable. I'd give this a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does point out a problem and suggests improvement, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide specific advice on how to simplify the writing. It could be more helpful if it gave some examples or steps. So, it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The method is only tested on two datasets. Have the authors tried more datasets to get a better idea of the performance.\" The action here is suggesting that the authors try more datasets. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly which datasets to try. So this should be highly actionable. I think it's a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions two datasets but doesn't specify which ones or provide details on why more datasets are needed. It's just a general statement about the number of datasets. So the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint the issue. It's not fully grounded. Also, it's not specific about what needs to be changed. So I'd rate this as 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim that the method is only tested on two datasets. The reviewer is suggesting the authors try more. But there's no justification or evidence provided for why more datasets are needed or how this would improve the method. It's vague and lacks support. So this is unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest a change, which is helpful. It gives the authors a clear direction to improve their method. However, it's not very detailed. It just asks about trying more datasets without explaining why or how this would help. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I'd rate this a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out a specific issue with Batch Normalization and Online Normalization, comparing them and explaining why one is unbiased and the other is biased. It ends by saying the reviewer has read other reviews and will stay with their original score. I think this is an explicit action because it directly addresses the problem. However, it doesn't give clear steps on how to fix it or suggest any changes. It's more of a clarification than an actionable improvement. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does state an action but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific normalization techniques and explains the difference in their approaches. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being discussed, which is the comparison between BN and ON. It doesn't mention external references or examples beyond the explanation provided. So, this seems to have **full grounding** because it accurately points to the section being addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review explains why Online Normalization is unbiased by comparing it to Batch Normalization and their respective dependencies. It uses logical reasoning to clarify the concept. There's no mention of external references, but the explanation is clear and logical. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some justification but could benefit from more examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides a meaningful comparison between the two normalization techniques. It helps the author understand the difference and why one might be preferred over the other. However, it doesn't suggest specific changes or improvements, so it's somewhat helpful but not entirely comprehensive. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it offers useful insights without being overly detailed.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the criteria provided, focusing on how clear, specific, and actionable the review is, as well as how well it supports the authors' needs.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

More experiments are necessary.\" I think this is explicit because it directly states what the author should do. The action is clear: they need to expand their experiments. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly where the problem is and what to do about it. So this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"one game environment\" and suggests \"more experiments.\" It's specific about the part of the paper it's addressing because it refers to the experiments section. It doesn't make any vague generalizations, so this is fully grounded. Also, it clearly specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the number of experiments. So this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that more experiments are needed. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states the issue without supporting evidence. So it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a clear issue and suggests a solution. It's specific and actionable, which is good for the authors. However, it doesn't go into why more experiments are necessary or how they should be conducted.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that in the case of recognition, lists are recalled based on items, but in the most common scenario of old vs new judgments, new items are all available except those seen. It mentions that it's hard to see how such a list could be implemented and tested with simulations. \n\nHmm, does this give the authors a clear action to take? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a problem but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. They mention the difficulty but don't offer a solution or a clear next step. So, I think this is **unactionable** because the authors don't know what to do after reading this.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about recognition lists and new items in memory. It mentions simulations but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section this refers to. The grounding here is weak because the reviewer isn't clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. They're making a general comment without pinning down exactly where the issue is. So, this should be **weakly grounded and not specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer states that it's hard to see how such a list could be implemented and tested. They don't provide any supporting evidence or references. This makes the claim somewhat vague and without justification. So, it's **somewhat verifiable** because there's a statement, but no solid backing.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't offer concrete solutions or further guidance. It's clear that the reviewer is pointing out an issue, but without actionable steps, it's not very helpful. So, this should be **somewhat helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 1 (unactionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 3 (weakly grounded and not specific)\n- Verifiability: 3 (somewhat verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (somewhat helpful)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It's an explicit suggestion, so it's clear what the authors should do. However, it doesn't provide specific steps or details on how to check this resilience. It's vague in terms of action, so it's not fully actionable.

I'm trying to see if this gives the authors clear instructions on what to do next. It mentions that FGT should be used for evaluating their method and others, but it doesn't specify how or what changes they should make. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which means the authors still don't know exactly how to apply this. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about FGT being used in an ablation study. But it doesn't clearly point out which specific part of the paper this refers to. The authors might have to guess where FGT is applied, which isn't very grounded. There's no specific mention of sections, tables, or unique aspects. So, the grounding is weak. I'd give this a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that FGT is only used for evaluating method performance in the ablation study. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review suggests where FGT should be used but doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to apply this information.

I'll rate it a 3.\n\nOverall, the review is somewhat helpful but lacks explicit actions and clear grounding or verifiability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that there's no need to distinguish between two types of distances, $d_{SM}$ and $d_{DM}$, because they're calculated the same way. This is an explicit statement, so it's clear what the author should do\u2014remove the distinction. It's direct and gives a clear action, so I think this is highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It just says they're calculated the same way, which is a general statement. There's no specific section or element being addressed, so it's not grounded. I'll rate this a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a judgment that the two distances are calculated the same way. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just an opinion without support, so it's unverifiable. I'll give it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear and suggests a simplification, which is helpful. However, it's quite brief and doesn't offer much depth or alternative suggestions. It's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors used the complexity of the Witness oracle, which is polynomial time in the tabular case. It feels like they didn't address the problem directly. Hmm, so the comment is pointing out a specific aspect but isn't giving a clear action or solution. It's more of a critique without a direct suggestion. So, I think this is **unactionable** because the authors don't know what to do next.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the Witness oracle's complexity but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague. The authors might not know exactly where the issue lies, so it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the approach not being direct. But there's no supporting evidence or justification. It's just a statement without backing, so it's **unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential issue but isn't clear on how it affects the paper or what changes to make. It lacks direction, so it's not helpful. The authors don't get actionable feedback here.\n\nSo, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because they're either unhelpful, ungrounded, unverifiable, or unactionable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the experiment description is lacking detail, which is important for judging the results. It also mentions seeing \"Questions\" for further details. I think this is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors where to look for more information. But is it concrete? It tells them where to find questions but doesn't specify what exactly to do. So, I'd say it's **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the \"Questions\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper those questions relate to. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or element. Therefore, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the questions but doesn't tie them to a specific part of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the experiment description needs more detail. It's suggesting looking at the \"Questions\" but doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning to back this up. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks supporting evidence. I'd rate this as **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review clearly points out a deficiency and provides a direction for the authors to seek more information. It's not vague and gives a clear path, so it's quite helpful. I think this deserves a **Somewhat Helpful** score because while it's helpful, it could be more detailed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect is rated as 3 because they all fall into the middle category of being somewhat actionable, weakly grounded, somewhat verifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"I am confused about the statement in Theorem 5.1...\" That's more of a question than a suggestion. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. It just points out confusion, which isn't actionable. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's probably unactionable, so I'll give it a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Theorem 5.1 but doesn't specify what part of the paper that refers to. It's unclear, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the issue, so it's not fully grounded. I think it's a 3 because it's not fully grounded but there's some mention of a specific part.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a judgment about the author's confusion regarding Theorem 5.1. There's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. It's just an opinion, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is a bit vague. It points out confusion but doesn't offer specific advice or solutions. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, I'll rate it a 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors should explain how morphologic segmentation works across domains and how it differs. It's explicit about the action, which is good. But it's vague on the specifics, like what exactly should be explained and how. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out the details themselves. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions morphologic segmentation across domains but doesn't specify which part of the paper or any unique elements. It's pretty vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where to focus. This means it's **1: Not Grounded** because there's no clear reference to a specific section or issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any evidence or justification for why morphologic segmentation should or shouldn't be invariant across domains. It's just a statement without support, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises valid points about the need for domain-specific considerations but doesn't offer concrete solutions or examples. It's somewhat helpful because it points out an important issue, but it lacks the depth needed to guide the authors effectively. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the object detection attention is performed on either the image or a feature map and asks if rescaling is done. It's explicit about the two possibilities, so the action is clear. However, it doesn't specify exactly what to do next, like suggesting a particular method or how to implement the rescaling. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully concrete. I think this falls under a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions both the image and the feature map, which are specific parts of the paper. It clearly identifies the sections being addressed, so this has full grounding. It also asks about rescaling, which is a specific issue within those sections. Therefore, grounding_specificity should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that attention is performed on either the image or a feature map. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for this claim. It just states what might be happening without backing it up. So, it's not verifiable at all, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking specific questions about the implementation details of attention mechanisms. While it's clear and directs the authors to check their code or implementation, it doesn't offer concrete suggestions or guidance on how to improve their work. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth, so I'd rate it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper is missing a discussion about the Set Transformer and other related works. It doesn't specify what needs to be done, like adding a discussion section or citing the work. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't tell the authors how to fix it. That makes it somewhat actionable because they know the problem, but they don't know how to address it. So, I think this is a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the Set Transformer by citation but doesn't specify where in the paper this should be discussed. It's a general suggestion without pinpointing the exact section or part of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It just says the paper is missing a discussion, but doesn't explain why that's a problem or how it affects the paper's quality. There's no reference to external knowledge or logical reasoning to back it up. So, this is unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a missing discussion but doesn't provide any specific guidance on what to add or how to improve it. It's clear that the authors need to add this discussion, but there's no detailed advice on what to include or how to structure it. So, it's somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue, but it doesn't fully assist the authors in improving their work. Therefore, helpfulness is a 3.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors should perform a statistical significance test but doesn't specify how. So, the action is explicit (they need to do a test), but the concreteness is lacking because it doesn't tell them exactly which test to use or how to implement it. This seems to fit the **3: Somewhat Actionable** category because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about comparing the proposed method with baselines. It doesn't explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is weak. However, it does clearly specify what needs to be addressed, which is the comparison. So, this would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not pinpointing a section but clearly states what's needed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests adding a statistical test but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's vague and lacks support, so it's **2: Borderline Verifiable** because there's an implicit claim (that a test is needed) without sufficient backing.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential improvement but doesn't elaborate on why it's necessary or how it affects the paper. It's clear that a test is needed, but without more context, it's somewhat helpful. So, this is **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify an area for improvement but doesn't fully address the authors' needs.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review suggests using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test instead of an independent test because the samples are from the same input. It's an implicit suggestion because the reviewer doesn't explicitly state the test to use but implies it. The suggestion is concrete because it specifies the test. However, it's not fully explicit, so it's borderline actionable. But since it's clear what needs to be done, I'll rate it as 4.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe reviewer mentions the test choice but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're addressing. They just suggest a test. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or issue. It's vague, so grounding_specificity is 3.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe reviewer's claim is that the Wilcoxon test is appropriate. They don't provide justification or references, so it's unverifiable. I'll rate this as 1.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review is clear about suggesting a better test but doesn't explain why the current test is incorrect or how to implement the alternative. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, helpfulness is 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Evidently, replacing any of the procedure steps of XAIFOILER with a random mechanism dropped its performance\" and then adds, \"I'm unsure that 'better than random' is a strong demonstration of capability.\" \n\nFirst, I check if the review is explicit or implicit. The first part talks about replacing steps with a random mechanism affecting performance, which is explicit. The second part is a question, which is also explicit. So, it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The first part mentions the effect on performance, which is specific. The second part asks about the strength of the demonstration, which is a bit vague. So, it's mostly actionable because the first part is concrete, but the second is vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to XAIFOILER, which I assume is a specific algorithm or model. The first part mentions replacing steps with a random mechanism, which is specific. The second part is a general critique about the demonstration, which doesn't pin down a specific part. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part being addressed beyond a general critique.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the first part is a claim that replacing steps with a random mechanism affects performance. It's supported by the statement that performance dropped. The second part is a critique about the strength of the demonstration, which is more of an opinion without external references or logical reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable because part of it is supported, but the critique isn't well-justified.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides a critique of the performance impact but doesn't offer specific suggestions for improvement. It's a bit vague and doesn't give actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful because it points out an issue, but it's not very detailed or constructive.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is mostly actionable but not fully, so actionability is 3. Grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly specify the part being addressed beyond a general critique, so grounding_specificity is 3. Verifiability is somewhat supported but lacks depth, so it's X. Helpfulness is moderate because it does point out an issue but doesn't offer much improvement guidance, so it's 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The organization of this paper could be further improved, such as give more background knowledge of the proposed method and bring the description of the relate literatures forward.\" Hmm, the action here is suggesting improvements but it's a bit vague. It tells the authors what needs to be done but doesn't specify exactly how. For example, it says \"give more background knowledge\" but doesn't suggest how to do that, like adding sections or what kind of background. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for improvement but not explicit on how to achieve it. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know they need to add more background, but the method isn't clear. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"give more background knowledge\" and \"bring the description of the relate literatures forward.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or which sections to add. The authors would have to guess where to put the background or how to discuss related literature. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or element. Therefore, grounding_specificity is probably a 3 as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a suggestion but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just says to add background and discuss related literature. There's no logical reasoning or references to support why this is necessary. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing to make the suggestion credible. Hence, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest specific areas for improvement, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to implement those changes. It could be more helpful if it offered concrete steps or examples. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Therefore, helpfulness is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says that some other models like PanopticFPN and Mask2Former aren't compared. The comment is suggesting that these should be included. Now, is this explicit or implicit? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out that these models aren't in the comparison, but they're not giving a direct action. The authors would need to figure out which models to add and how to compare them. So, it's not explicit because it's not telling them exactly what to do. It's more of an implicit suggestion. \n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment mentions specific models, which is good because it's pointing to particular parts of the paper. However, it's not clear which section of the paper these models relate to. The authors might have to infer where these models fit in, so the grounding isn't fully explicit. It's weak grounding because they can't precisely identify the referenced part without more context.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that some models aren't compared. But it's not providing any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does suggest adding some models but doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to do that or why these models are important. It's vague, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. Therefore, it's a 2 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors didn't enforce diversity explicitly but only motivated it. It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a specific issue. Now, is this an explicit action or implicit? The reviewer is stating a problem but isn't giving a direct solution. They're suggesting that the authors should enforce diversity, but they don't specify how. So, it's an implicit action because the authors have to infer how to fix it. Since it's implicit, it's not actionable enough because the authors don't know exactly what to do. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about the diversity word in the title and the model not enforcing it explicitly. They mention the word \"diversity\" but don't specify which part of the paper or model they're referring to. They also don't provide examples or suggest specific changes. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The specificity is low because they don't explain what needs to be done. So, this would be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that diversity isn't enforced explicitly. They don't provide any evidence or references to support this. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to make it reliable. Therefore, this gets a 3 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer points out a concern but doesn't offer specific suggestions or explain why it's a problem. They leave the authors with a general feeling of disappointment but no concrete steps to improve. This isn't very helpful because it doesn't guide the authors on how to fix the issue. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully, which would be a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated based on how well the review provides actionable feedback, grounds the issue specifically, supports claims with evidence, and offers helpful suggestions to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"some experiments are missing, e.g., contrastive learning and adversarial learning.\" It mentions that experiments are missing and gives examples. So, the action is clear: add those experiments. But the problem is, it doesn't specify exactly where to add them or how to implement it. It just says \"add them,\" which is a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to do next. It's more of an implicit suggestion, so I think it's borderline actionable. Maybe a 2 or 3? But according to the scale, 1 is unactionable, 2 is borderline, 3 is somewhat. Since it's giving a direction but not the specifics, I'll go with 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"some experiments are missing\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly the experiments should be added. It just gives examples without pointing to the relevant section. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded, so I'd rate this as 1 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review states that certain experiments are missing and gives examples. But it doesn't provide any justification or references for why these experiments are important or why they should be added. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing to make the claim credible. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out that some experiments are missing and suggests adding them. It's clear and provides a reason, but it doesn't specify exactly what to add or where.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions introducing inverse triples in other embedding models but doesn't test them in their experiments. It suggests this could be a point for improvement, which is explicit. However, it doesn't specify how the authors should test these cases or what changes they should make. So, it's not very detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it explicitly states an action but doesn't give clear instructions on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about inverse triples in general but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where to focus their testing. So, it's not fully grounded because it's not pointing to a specific section or figure. It's more of a general suggestion without pinpointing the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that introducing inverse triples could be useful but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this. It's just a suggestion without backing, so it's not verifiable. It falls into the \"Unverifiable\" category.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a potential improvement area but doesn't elaborate on why inverse triples are important or how they might affect the model. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an area for improvement, but it lacks depth and justification, making it only somewhat helpful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the Atari game results are limited to a single game and baseline but doesn't specify how to improve this. It's vague on the actions the authors should take. So, it's not explicit because it's just stating a problem without suggesting a fix. It's also not concrete because it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. So, this should be a **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out a specific section (Section 7.2) but doesn't explain why that section is problematic or what needs to be changed. It's only making a general comment without clearly identifying the issue within that section. So, this is **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the section but doesn't elaborate on the specifics.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about the limitation of the results but isn't providing any justification or references. It's just stating that it's hard to interpret without backing it up. So, this falls under **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify a weakness in the results but doesn't offer any suggestions or guidance on how to address it. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does point out an issue, just not in a helpful way.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that ReLUs were used in AlexNet, which was a deep network with convolutional layers. It clarifies that ReLUs aren't used in the convolutional layers, which is a direct action. However, it doesn't specify how to apply this information, like suggesting an alternative activation function. So, it's explicit but lacks detail, making it somewhat actionable. I think a 3 here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review clearly mentions the AlexNet paper and specifies that ReLUs aren't used in the convolutional layers. It's not just a general statement but points to a specific part of the paper. So, it's fully grounded. But does it explain why ReLUs aren't used there? It doesn't, so it's not very specific. Maybe a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that ReLUs don't work well in deep or convolutional networks. It supports this by citing AlexNet, which was a deep network using ReLUs in some layers. This provides some justification, but it's a bit vague. It could be clearer about why ReLUs aren't used in conv layers. So, I'd rate it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a specific example but doesn't go into how to improve the model or suggest alternatives. It's informative but lacks depth. So, it's somewhat helpful, maybe a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated a 3 because they're all somewhat present but could be improved with more details or examples.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that hyperparameters k and \u03b7 need finetuning. It also says this depends on availability to the environment or a good OPE method. The action here is suggesting that the hyperparameters need finetuning, which is explicit. However, the review doesn't specify exactly how to finetune them or what steps the authors should take. It's a bit vague on the implementation details. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know the exact method or tools to use. Therefore, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to hyperparameters k and \u03b7 but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model they are associated with. It's unclear which section or figure the authors are talking about. Also, it doesn't provide specific examples or mention external work, so it's not grounded. The grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. So, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the hyperparameters need finetuning based on availability or OPE methods. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. There's no logical reasoning or examples to back this up. So, the claim is unverifiable, making verifiability 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest that the hyperparameters need finetuning but doesn't provide concrete steps or tools. It's vague and lacks clarity, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully constructive. Therefore, helpfulness is also 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in providing clear, specific, and actionable feedback, so all four aspects are scored as 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

The comment is suggesting that the author either doesn't understand Figure 5 or the labels are wrong. It's a bit vague because it doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done. The author is pointing out an issue but isn't giving a clear action. So, it's not explicit because it's more of a statement than a direct instruction. Therefore, it's not actionable because the author isn't told what to do. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to Figure 5, which is specific, but it's not clear whether the author is talking about the labels or the overall understanding. It's a bit vague about what exactly is wrong. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact issue. The specificity is also low because it doesn't clearly explain what's wrong with the figure. So, both grounding and specificity would be 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is stating that the labels are wrong, which is a claim. However, there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a statement that something is wrong without backing it up. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting information. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is pointing out an issue but isn't providing clear guidance on how to fix it. It's vague and doesn't give specific steps or explanations. So, it's not very helpful because the author isn't given actionable steps. Therefore, helpfulness is 1.\n\nSo, all four aspects are rated as 1 because the review point is vague and doesn't provide clear, actionable feedback.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that performance differences are minimal and attributes it to random variation and outdated benchmarks. It doesn't suggest any specific changes or actions the authors should take. So, it's not explicit or pointing out what needs to be done. I think this is **1: Unactionable** because there's no clear direction for improvement.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about performance differences and outdated benchmarks but doesn't specify which part of the paper or method this refers to. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issues are. That means it's **1: Not Grounded** because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the performance differences are minimal and mentions random variation and outdated benchmarks. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up these claims. So, it's not well-supported, making it **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out that the performance differences are minimal and suggests that the benchmarks are outdated. However, it doesn't provide specific suggestions or detailed reasoning for why these issues are important. It's somewhat pointing out problems but lacks depth and clarity.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the related discussion lacks interpretive insights and that the paper doesn't compare its methods with other state-of-the-art methods. It suggests adding these comparisons. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out specific areas where the paper needs improvement, so that's explicit. But does it give a clear action? The reviewer is saying the paper should add these comparisons, which is a clear action. However, they don't specify exactly how to add them or where to find the state-of-the-art methods. So, it's somewhat actionable because the action is clear, but the details are vague. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about the experiments part lacking interpretive insights and the omission of comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods. They mention specific areas like \"manifold-based learning\" and \"state-of-the-art methods.\" This seems like they're accurately pinpointing the sections or aspects of the paper. So, the grounding is full because they're clearly referring to specific parts. Then, they specify what needs to be addressed, which is the comparisons. So, this is both grounded and specific. That would be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the lack of interpretive insights and the omission of comparisons. They're suggesting that the paper should add these, which is a claim. Now, is this claim supported by evidence? The reviewer doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back up why these omissions are problematic. They just state that the paper lacks these elements. So, the claim is made without sufficient justification or evidence, making it somewhat verifiable. I'd give this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer provides clear suggestions about adding interpretive insights and comparisons with other methods. They're pointing out specific areas where the paper can be improved, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are somewhat vague in terms of how to implement them. They don't give specific steps or references, so while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback. So, I'd rate this as 4.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the criteria provided, considering whether the review is explicit or implicit, how specific the references are, how well the claims are supported, and how helpful the suggestions are.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the study's improvements might be due to regularization effects instead of distillation because of the specific training conditions. It suggests proper ablation studies. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. But is it concrete? The review doesn't specify exactly how to perform the ablation studies, like how many runs or what controls to use. So it's not fully concrete. I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to the specific part of the paper where the training conditions are mentioned. It doesn't just say \"the study\" but points out the exact details about fine-tuning for 10 epochs without early stopping. This makes it grounded because it clearly identifies the section. Also, it explains what the issue is, which is about whether the effect is due to regularization or distillation. So this should be a 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the results could be due to regularization effects. It supports this by pointing out that GLUE tasks usually have high variances without validation and early stopping, suggesting the need for ablation studies. This provides logical reasoning and references common knowledge about GLUE tasks, so it's verifiable. I'd give this a 3 because while it's somewhat verifiable, it could be clearer about how to conduct the ablation studies.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a potential flaw in the methodology and suggests a specific improvement. It's clear and provides actionable feedback. However, it doesn't go as far as suggesting alternative methods or alternative experiments, which could make it even more helpful. So I think a 4 is appropriate because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring that each score reflects the clarity, specificity, and verifiability of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the experimental results suggest the approach is valuable but doesn't explain why self-supervised learning is needed for 360 video data. It's pointing out a gap but isn't giving a clear action or suggestion. So, it's not explicit or vague. Since it's not giving a direct action, it's probably unactionable. So, I'd give it a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about 360 video data having spatial audio but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's making a general comment without pinpointing the exact section or figure. So, it's not fully grounded. It's somewhere between weakly grounded and not specific. Looking at the scale, that would be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about the need for self-supervised learning but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a relevant issue but doesn't offer any suggestions or explanations. It's making a statement that's somewhat critical but lacks actionable advice. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. That would be a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is quite vague and doesn't provide much direction for the authors to improve their work. It's helpful in identifying an issue but lacks the necessary details to be truly useful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that only the SimCLR case is covered and suggests there's no analysis on the projection head, which is important. It's explicit about pointing out the missing part, so that's good. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. They still need to figure out how to analyze the projection head. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. That should be a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the projection head without explicitly naming it. It's a bit vague because the authors might not know exactly where to focus. So, it's not fully grounded. It's a 3 because it's weakly grounded but mentions what needs improvement.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the projection head analysis is missing. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a missing part but doesn't explain why it's important or how it affects the work. It's clear that the projection head is important, but without more context, the authors might not find it helpful. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully, which is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, considering explicitness, grounding, verifiability, and overall usefulness to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper lacks experiments like comparison, ablation, and hyperparameter analysis. It's explicit about the action\u2014adding these experiments\u2014but doesn't specify how to do it. So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the details are missing. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I think a 3 is appropriate.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific types of experiments but doesn't tie them to a particular section or figure in the paper. It's a bit vague about where these experiments should be added. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't pinpoint the exact part of the paper. Maybe a 3 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the paper lacks certain experiments. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references to support this claim. It's just stating an opinion without backing, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out the need for additional experiments but doesn't suggest how to add them or where to place them. It's clear that the authors need to make changes, but the guidance is minimal. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. A 3 seems right here.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the proposed method doesn't have an advantage without prior information and that the advantage comes when using prior knowledge. It also suggests considering the extra complexity and cost. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. It doesn't just imply; it clearly states the issues and the solution. So, that should be a high score. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review points out specific issues like the lack of advantage without prior info and the need to consider extra complexity. It doesn't just refer to the paper in a vague way; it mentions VAE/GAN + CL models. That's pretty specific. So, I think this is fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the comparison is unfair because of the extra models. It provides some reasoning about the extra complexity, but it's a bit vague. It doesn't cite external references or give a clear justification beyond the extra models. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does suggest improvements and points out specific issues, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into much detail about how to adjust the method or what specific changes to make. It's clear and actionable, but maybe a bit brief. So, I think it's mostly helpful, which is a 4.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is explicit and specific, so high scores there. It's somewhat justified but not fully robust, so a 3 for verifiability. And it's mostly helpful because it guides the authors, just not in too much detail.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the regularization term is ad-hoc and lacks theoretical support. It suggests using other statistics like the median instead of the mean. The comment is explicit about the action\u2014suggesting changes to the regularization. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to replace the mean and standard deviation with the median. So, it's clear that an action is needed, but the details are vague. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** (label 3).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review points out that the author's explanation is intuitive but lacks theoretical support. It also mentions that some statistics could replace the mean and standard deviation. The comment references specific statistics (median) but doesn't tie them to the paper's unique aspects. It's clear which part is being addressed, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is good because it suggests alternative statistics, which adds clarity. So, this gets a **Fully Grounded and Specific** (label 5).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the regularization is ad-hoc and lacks support. It suggests using the median as an alternative. The reasoning is logical, explaining why the median is less sensitive to outliers. It references common knowledge about robust statistics but doesn't cite specific literature. The claim is somewhat justified but lacks external references, so it's **Somewhat Verifiable** (label 3).\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review provides suggestions for improvement but doesn't specify how to implement them. It mentions alternative statistics but doesn't guide the author on where to look or how to test them. The feedback is clear but lacks depth, making it somewhat helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors discuss iteration cost and mention related methods. It's explicit about the action but doesn't give details on how to do it. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to do next. That should be a 3.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the comment talks about iteration cost and related methods but doesn't specify which part of the paper or which section. It's a bit vague, so it's weakly grounded. It's not fully specific because it doesn't pinpoint the exact issue. So, a 3 here too.\n\nNext, **verifiability**: The comment is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It's just recommending something but not backing it up. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out an important area for improvement but is quite vague. It doesn't provide concrete steps or examples, so the authors won't have much to go on. It's somewhat helpful but not very detailed. So, a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 3 except verifiability, which is 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The comment says the figures are small and unreadable, doesn't explain how equation 5 follows from 4, and mentions theta^{t+1/2} and the definitions of S* and S~. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The first part about figures being small is explicit, but it's vague on what to do next. The comment about equation 5 not following from 4 is implicit because it doesn't specify how to fix it. Similarly, the mention of theta^{t+1/2} is vague. The last part about S* and S~ is explicit but vague on how to define them. So, it's partially actionable but not fully because some parts are vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to figures, equations, and parameters but doesn't specify exactly which section or figure. It mentions equations and parameters without pointing to their locations or how they relate to the text. So, it's not fully grounded because it's too vague about where the issues are.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The comment makes claims about figures being unreadable, equations not following, and definitions being cyclic. Each of these could be supported by references or reasoning. For example, explaining why small figures are an issue could reference readability standards. The lack of explanation for equation 5 might need a reference to mathematical principles. The cyclic definition of S~ could be linked to prior literature. So, while it's somewhat justified, it's not fully robust with references or clear reasoning.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment addresses multiple issues: figures, equations, and definitions. It provides clear suggestions but lacks specific details on how to improve each part. For instance, it doesn't suggest alternative visualizations for the figures or methods to clarify the equations. However, it does point out several areas needing improvement, making it somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the comment is highly actionable because it's clear where the issues are, but some parts are vague. Grounding is weak because it's too broad. Verifiability is somewhat there but could be stronger with references. Helpfulness is good but lacks specific fixes, so it's mostly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

This is a clear and direct instruction for the authors. Additionally, it provides concrete details about what needs to be done, such as mentioning division by zero and the definition of VAD. Therefore, it is highly actionable with explicit and concrete instructions.  \n   - **Score:** 5  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label:**  \n   The review point mentions specific parts of the paper, such as \"TF bins\" and \"VAD\". It also refers to the presence of speech and energy, which are specific aspects of the paper. The mention of division by zero and the definition of VAD adds clarity about the issue. The grounding is strong as it accurately identifies the problematic part and explains why it's an issue.  \n   - **Score:** 5  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label:**  \n   The review point contains a claim that VAD is not just about discarding zero-magnitude bins but involves looking for speech presence. This claim is supported by logical reasoning explaining the implications of such an approach and why it doesn't meet the definition of VAD. The reasoning is clear and provides sufficient justification.  \n   - **Score:** 4  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label:**  \n   The review point is very helpful as it not only points out the issue but also explains why it's problematic and suggests an alternative approach.

If possible, results on ImageNet can be more convincing of the proposed method.\" Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review suggests that results on ImageNet would be more convincing, but it doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's just a statement of what could be better, not an explicit action. So, it's not giving clear instructions on how to improve. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions ImageNet, which is a specific dataset, but it's not clearly pointing out why this is relevant or what part of the paper needs improvement. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding isn't strong. I think this is a 1 here too.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is suggesting that results on ImageNet would be more convincing, but it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why ImageNet would be better. There's no reference to external works or logical reasoning. So, it's not verifiable. That's another 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does suggest an improvement area, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide specific guidance on how to apply this change. It's somewhat helpful but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 2.\n\nOverall, the review point is somewhat helpful but lacks clarity and specific guidance, so it's not highly actionable, grounded, or verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the contribution is insufficient and suggests the authors should explore how to leverage the connection between complementary and model robustness. It also points out that the conclusion is easily obtainable. So, the reviewer is giving an explicit action: suggesting the authors look into more insightful findings or solutions. That's clear, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify exactly what the authors should do, like suggesting specific methods or experiments. So, it's explicit but not very concrete. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about the connection between complementary and robustness but doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. They mention that the conclusion is easily obtainable, which is a bit vague. So, the reviewer isn't pinpointing a specific section or figure, which means the grounding is weak. However, they do clearly identify the issue, so it's not completely weak. I think this falls under **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**, because they do mention what's wrong but don't specify exactly where.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the contribution is insufficient and suggests improvements. They provide some reasoning about the conclusion being easily obtainable but don't cite external references or specific examples. The reasoning is logical but lacks depth. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer points out a significant concern about the contribution being insufficient and provides a clear suggestion to explore more on the connection. While it's good that they identify an issue and suggest improvements, the suggestion is quite broad and doesn't offer specific solutions or methods. It could be more helpful if they had provided concrete examples or further analysis. So, I think this is **4: Mostly Helpful** because it does provide meaningful feedback, but it could be improved for clarity and specificity.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the content of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the authors made a mistake in their description of the IOI circuit according to Wang et al., 2023. It tells the authors exactly where the error is and provides a reference. That seems pretty explicit and direct. There's no ambiguity here, so it's definitely actionable. I think this should be a 5 because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"Section 3 of Wang et al., 2023\" which is specific. It also clearly states what the error is and where it should be corrected. The authors can easily pinpoint where to look in the reference. This seems fully grounded and specific, so another 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a specific reference to an external source (Wang et al., 2023) and explains why the authors' statement is incorrect. This is logical reasoning and external support, making it fully verifiable. So, a 5 here as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific mistake, providing a clear correction, and references an external source. It's concise and gives the authors clear directions on what to do. This should be highly helpful, so a 5 makes sense.\n\nI don't see any issues with these evaluations.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It is not clear why eta_ri term is non-central chi-squared distribution.\" The author is pointing out that the reasoning behind the term's distribution isn't clear. Now, for actionability, I need to see if this comment gives a clear direction for improvement. The comment doesn't specify what the author should do next. It just states a problem but doesn't suggest a fix or a place to look. So, it's not explicit or implicit in telling the author how to improve. Therefore, it's unactionable. I'll give it a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the comment is. The review mentions the eta_ri term but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to or why it's a non-central chi-squared distribution. It's too vague. The author can't pinpoint the issue, so the grounding is weak. It's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. So, I'll rate this as 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, I need to check if the comment is a claim and if it's supported. The comment is a statement of a problem, which is a claim. However, there's no justification or evidence provided. It just states that the reasoning is unclear but doesn't back it up with references or logical reasoning. So, it's unverifiable. The label here is X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a lack of clarity but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the author know what to do next. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the proposed method isn't well-positioned in the literature and points out a key idea that's been used before, citing specific works. It suggests the authors do a thorough literature review. The action here is clear: the authors should perform a literature review. However, the instructions say that explicit actions are better than implicit. In this case, the comment is explicit about suggesting a literature review, which is a direct action. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? Not really; it just says to do a literature review. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. I think this is a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what to do but doesn't specify how in detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific citations, like [1] and [2], which are examples of works using the same idea. This means the comment is explicitly pointing to specific literature, so it's well-grounded. It also clearly explains what the issue is by referencing existing methods, which makes it specific about the problem. Therefore, this should be a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides references to specific works, which are external sources. This means the claim that the idea is well-known is supported by external evidence, making it verifiable. It's thorough enough, so I'd rate this a **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out existing literature and suggesting a literature review, which is a clear and actionable piece of feedback. It helps the authors by directing them to relevant work, which can improve their paper. This seems highly helpful because it guides them to further resources, so I'll give it a **5: Highly Helpful**.\n\nWait, but for actionability, I initially thought it was a 3 because it's explicit but lacks detail. Maybe I should double-check. The comment says the authors should do a thorough literature review, which is a clear action but doesn't specify how to conduct it. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully detailed. Yeah, 3 seems right.\n\nOverall, the review is quite helpful, well-grounded, fully verifiable, and actionable with a clear but not overly detailed suggestion.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Though this is not necessary, I'm curious about the performance of the SOTA method (e.g. LST) combined with the adaptive metric.\" Hmm, the reviewer is expressing curiosity but doesn't specify what needs to be done. They're not giving any actionable suggestions. So, this doesn't provide clear guidance for the authors to improve their work. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer mentions the SOTA method and adaptive metric but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what issue they're addressing. They're just referring to methods without pinpointing anything in the paper. So, the grounding is weak because they can't accurately identify the referenced part. This also scores a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is more about curiosity than providing a claim. It doesn't state any opinions or judgments about the paper. It's just a question or expression of interest, so there's no verifiable claim here. Therefore, it's unverifiable, giving it a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer isn't offering any meaningful feedback or suggestions. They're just asking about specific methods, which doesn't help the authors improve their draft. So, it's not helpful at all, scoring a 1.\n\nOverall, the review point doesn't provide any actionable or specific feedback, so all aspects are rated as 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a more detailed discussion of related work. It says, \"As the available space allows it, the paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of related work, by not only describing the related works, but also discussing the differences to the presented work.\" \n\nHmm, so the reviewer is giving a suggestion to improve the paper. That's an explicit action. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? The reviewer is saying to add more details, but it doesn't specify exactly how to do that. They mention discussing differences, but that's still vague. So, it's explicit in terms of the action (adding a discussion) but vague in the details. I think that makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear that an action is needed but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about related work but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It just says \"a more detailed discussion of related work.\" So, the reviewer isn't pointing to a specific section or figure. They're making a general comment. Since they're not pinning down exactly where the issue is, it's not fully grounded. But they are clear about what needs to be addressed\u2014more details on related work. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not specific about the part but clearly states what needs fixing.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It's just saying, \"the paper would benefit from...\" without explaining why or how this would help. There's no logical reasoning or references provided. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing for the claim. That would be **3: Somewhat Verifiable** since it's making a claim but not supporting it well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is suggesting adding a more detailed related work section. It's clear and actionable, but it doesn't specify exactly how to implement it. It's a good suggestion but could be more detailed. So, it's somewhat helpful because it provides a meaningful improvement direction, but it's not the most helpful since it lacks specifics.

But it doesn't specify how to implement it, like suggesting specific models or methods. So it's not fully actionable because the details are missing. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions other tasks and architectures but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It's a bit vague, so the grounding isn't strong. It's not fully grounded because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or element.

It's just a suggestion without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential improvement, which is helpful. It gives a direction for the authors to take. Even though it's not fully detailed, it's still useful. So I'd rate this a 3 because it's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated a 3 because they either lack detail or are not fully justified but still provide some value to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"It appears that the output from the algorithm depends on the order in which the data are processed. This should be clarified.\" The key here is whether this comment gives the author a clear action to take. The comment mentions that the output depends on data order and suggests clarifying it. That's an explicit action, so it's not implicit. However, the comment doesn't specify how to clarify it. It's vague on the method, so it's not fully actionable. That would make it **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment talks about the algorithm's output depending on data order but doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. Since it's not pointing out a specific section or figure, the grounding is weak. It's not fully identifying the issue, so it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the output depends on data order. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an observation without supporting evidence, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment points out a potential issue but doesn't offer concrete solutions. It's vague and doesn't guide the author on how to fix it. So, it's **2: Barely Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The comment is clear but lacks specific details and solutions, so it's helpful but not highly so.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that mitigation strategies aim to reduce memorization but doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done. It talks about a trade-off but doesn't give clear actions or steps. So, it's not explicit because it's more of an implication. It's also vague because it doesn't outline how to mitigate or what changes to make. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does mention the aim but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to mitigation strategies without pinpointing exactly which part of the paper or model it's addressing. It's talking about a general trade-off without clearly identifying the section or figure. So, it's not fully grounded. It's also not specific because it doesn't detail what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clearly pointing out the exact part of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment about the trade-off between mitigation and performance but doesn't provide any evidence or references. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it's not verifiable. This would fall under **1: Unverifiable** because there's no supporting evidence or reasoning.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a concern about the trade-off but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or solutions. It's more of a critique without actionable advice. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does inform the authors about a potential issue but doesn't provide clear guidance on how to address it.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated as 3 because they either provide some information without being fully explicit, grounded, verifiable, or helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using tabular data but doesn't specify how to implement it. It's vague about the actions the authors should take. So, it's not explicit because it doesn't tell them exactly what to do. It's also not concrete because it doesn't provide details on how to apply the suggestion. Therefore, it's somewhere between 2 and 3. Since it's vague and lacks detail, I think it's a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about tabular data but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be done. It's too general. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the exact area. The specificity is also low because it doesn't clearly explain what needs to be addressed. So, this would be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claim. It's just suggesting a method but not providing any justification or evidence. So, it's classified as \"X\" because there's no claim to verify.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is interesting but not necessary. It doesn't offer clear feedback or actionable steps. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"More details on using attention would be useful, perhaps as an extra appendix.\" I need to check if this is explicit or implicit. It seems like the reviewer is suggesting adding more details, which is an explicit action. But is it vague? The reviewer doesn't specify how to add these details or where exactly in the paper they should go. So, it's explicit but vague. According to the scale, that would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment is about adding more details on using attention. It doesn't mention a specific part of the paper, like a section or figure. It's a general suggestion. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific area. But it does specify what needs to be addressed, which is adding details. So, it's weakly grounded but specific about the issue. That would be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It's just recommending something, not claiming anything that needs justification. So, it's a normal statement, which means no claim is present. Therefore, verifiability is X, which is the lowest score.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment suggests adding more details but doesn't specify how or where. It's somewhat vague, so while it's helpful, it's not the most helpful because it doesn't provide concrete guidance. So, it's a 3 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the explicit methods perform better than the implicit ones on locomotion tasks and points out that the pseudo-code is missing. It suggests that the authors should address this issue. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The review does say \"should address\" which is direct, so it's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It says the pseudo-code is missing but doesn't specify how to add it. So it's not fully actionable. Maybe it's a 2 because it's borderline. But the user said to give 5 if unsure, so I'll go with 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the performance of explicit vs. implicit methods and mentions the missing pseudo-code. It doesn't specify which section of the paper the pseudo-code is in, so the grounding is weak. It does mention the missing element, which is specific, so it's somewhat grounded. I think that's a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that explicit methods are better and that the pseudo-code is missing. It doesn't provide any justification or references. So there's no verifiability, which would be a 1 with an X since there's no claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out two issues: the performance difference and the missing pseudo-code. However, it doesn't suggest solutions or explain why the explicit methods are better. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth, so a 3 seems right.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests looking at a related study and mentions specific figures. It's pretty explicit about the actions to take, like checking the figures and referencing the studies. The instructions say that explicit actions are good because they let the authors know exactly what to do. So, this seems highly actionable. I think it's a 5 here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific references and talks about the figures. It's clear which parts of the paper it's referring to, like the figures and the studies. It doesn't just say \"check something,\" it points to exact sections. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That's another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides references to other studies, which adds credibility. It's not just a opinion but backed by external work. The reasoning is logical, pointing out that the differences are too small but referencing data from other papers. So, it's mostly verifiable with some minor gaps, but still solid. I'll give it a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers concrete suggestions, references, and points to specific areas. It's clear and actionable, which is exactly what helps authors improve. It's not just vague; it gives real guidance. So, this is highly helpful, a 5.\n\nOverall, each aspect seems to be well addressed, making the review quite effective for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that experimental validation isn't convincing because only shallow networks (2 or 3 layers) are considered. It also points out that the optimization strategy, including the grid search for hyperparameters, isn't described. There's a minor issue about positioning relative to related work, suggesting layer redundancy isn't discussed. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The comment does suggest looking into shallow networks and the optimization strategy, which is explicit. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement the grid search or where to find information on layer redundancy. So, it's somewhat vague on the implementation details. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but not exactly how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"shallow networks\" and \"related work\" without explicitly naming sections or tables in the paper. It mentions a specific paper for layer redundancy but doesn't provide a unique element or a clear reference point. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't precisely identify which part of the paper is being discussed. It's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the experimental validation isn't convincing and lists specific issues. It also references an external paper, which provides some justification. The reference is logical and points to a relevant source, so it's somewhat verifiable. That would be **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify some weaknesses and provides references, which is helpful. However, it's quite brief and doesn't offer many specific suggestions or details on how to improve. It's somewhat helpful but could be expanded. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, the user provided a different breakdown. Let me check again. Actionability was labeled as 5, but I thought it was 3. Maybe I was too hasty. The review explicitly mentions the issues but doesn't give clear instructions on how to fix them. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe it should be 3. Grounding was 5, but I thought it was weak. Maybe because it refers to specific literature, it's grounded. I'm a bit confused there. Verifiability was 4, but I thought it was somewhat verifiable. Maybe it's fully verifiable because it references an external source. Helpfulness was 4, but I thought it was somewhat helpful. Maybe it's fully helpful because it does provide some meaningful feedback.\n\nI think I need to reassess. The grounding is weak because it doesn't specify the paper sections but refers to literature. The verifiability is fully verifiable because it references an external source. Helpfulness is fully helpful because it does provide meaningful feedback, even if it's brief. Actionability is somewhat actionable because it's explicit about the issues but doesn't give detailed implementation steps, so maybe 3.\n\nBut the initial output was all 5s except grounding as 5. Maybe I was wrong about grounding. If it refers to specific literature, it's grounded. So, perhaps it's 5. But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'll stick with the initial evaluation.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the model was only tested on Task 1 of bAbI. I think this is an explicit action because it directly mentions the specific task. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. They might need to look into other tasks themselves. So, it's not fully actionable because there's no clear instruction on how to proceed. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Task 1, which is specific. It doesn't make any vague claims about the model's performance. So, the grounding is clear, and the specificity is good because it directly addresses the task. I think this would be a 3 here as well because it's grounded but maybe not the most specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the model was only tested on one task. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to make it reliable. That would be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a limitation, which is helpful because it encourages the authors to consider other tasks. However, it's quite vague and doesn't suggest specific improvements. It's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. So, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nOverall, each aspect has its own evaluation based on how clear, grounded, verifiable, and helpful the comment is.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It is hard to follow Sec. 3.2. The author may improve it and give more illustrations and examples.\" The first part is clear\u2014it points out that Sec. 3.2 is hard to follow. The second part suggests improvements but doesn't specify exactly what to do. It says \"give more illustrations and examples,\" which is a bit vague. So, it's not an explicit action because it's not telling the author exactly what to add. It's more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's vague about how to improve, it doesn't meet the concrete criteria. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does mention the issue but doesn't give clear instructions on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Sec. 3.2 but doesn't specify what exactly is wrong with it. It just says it's hard to follow. The author might need to know if it's the structure, clarity, or something else. Without pinpointing the specific issue, the grounding is weak. So, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does touch on the section but doesn't clearly identify the problem.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that Sec. 3.2 is hard to follow and suggests improvements. There's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's just an opinion without backing. So, this falls under **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification or examples given to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are quite general\u2014more illustrations and examples. It doesn't specify where or how to add them, so while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does provide some guidance but lacks specifics.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that GCG's approach can be transferred to other LLMs and suggests including such a comparison. It also points out that the jailbreaking percentage is low for certain LLMs. The action here is clear: authors should include a comparison and address the low jailbreaking percentage. The instructions say that explicit actions are good. This is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. It doesn't just suggest; it gives specific steps. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while it's explicit, it's a bit vague on how exactly to implement the comparison or fix the jailbreaking issue.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about GCG's approach being transferable and mentions the jailbreaking percentage. It doesn't specify which LLMs or provide examples. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly which parts need improvement. It's more of a general statement rather than addressing a specific section or figure. Therefore, this should be **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that GCG's approach can be transferred and that the jailbreaking percentage is low. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back these points. Without justification, the claims are unverifiable. So, this is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some suggestions but doesn't go into detail. It tells the authors to include a comparison and address the jailbreaking issue but doesn't explain why these changes are important or how they improve the paper. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Each aspect has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that setting parameter S is a problem but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's vague, so it's not giving a clear action. Since it's not explicit or concrete, it's unactionable. So, the actionability score should be 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"parameter S\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is wrong. It's too vague, so grounding is weak. The comment doesn't clearly identify the issue, so grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that there's a problem with setting S but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just a claim without support, so it's unverifiable. The verifiability score is 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out an issue but doesn't offer any solutions or guidance. It's only a negative statement without any suggestions, so it's not helpful. The helpfulness score is 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

This provides a clear action for the authors to consider tuning these parameters.  \n   - However, the suggestion is somewhat vague because it doesn't specify how to implement the tuning or what parameters to adjust.  \n   - Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - The comment refers to \"the choice of employing a convex or concave constraint\" and \"an increasing/decreasing constraint,\" which are specific parts of the paper.  \n   - It mentions that these choices are hyperparameters, making it clear which aspects are being addressed.  \n   - However, it doesn't provide specific examples or references, so it's **3: Grounding Specific and Specific**.\n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   - The claim is that the choice of constraints is a hyperparameter needing tuning.  \n   - The reasoning is that constraints are typically hyperparameters, which is a general statement.  \n   - There's no specific reference to external literature or examples, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   - The review provides a clear point that tuning is necessary, which is helpful.  \n   - However, it doesn't specify how to tune or what parameters to adjust, making it somewhat incomplete.  \n   - Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that bias benchmarks only assess gender, race, and religion, and are missing state-of-the-art models like GPT. It also points out that other important biases and datasets aren't measured. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the review is explicit and concrete. The review does suggest improvements, like adding assessments for other biases and datasets, so that's explicit. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement these changes, like which specific parts of the paper to focus on or how to incorporate GPT. So it's not fully actionable because the implementation details are missing. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about bias benchmarks missing certain aspects. It mentions gender, race, religion, and state-of-the-art models. This seems pretty specific because it's pointing out exact areas where the current benchmarks fall short. The authors can identify which parts of their work need improvement based on this. So I think this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the bias benchmarks only assess a few specific attributes. This is a claim, and it's supported by the information given. The authors can verify the claim by looking at the mentioned attributes. There's no need for external references or logical reasoning beyond what's provided. So this is **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear feedback on the limitations of the current benchmarks and suggests improvements. It's pointing out specific areas where the authors can enhance their work. While it doesn't go into every possible improvement, it's comprehensive enough to be helpful. So this would be **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects. The review is somewhat actionable because it suggests improvements but lacks specific implementation details. It's fully grounded and specific because it clearly points out the missing aspects. The claim is verifiable with the information given. And overall, it's helpful because it guides the authors on where to focus their improvements.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that Figure 3 is challenging to understand and lists specific issues like unclear workflow and captions, as well as confusing representation of communication modes. It seems like the reviewer is pointing out problems but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. The authors would need to infer how to improve the figure themselves. This is explicit but vague, so I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Figure 3 by name and mentions specific issues without being too vague. It doesn't just say \"the figure is unclear\" but points out exact problems. So this should be **3: Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why Figure 3 is an issue. It's just a statement of problems without backing it up with references or logical reasoning. So this is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify some problems but doesn't offer clear solutions or suggest improvements. It's somewhat helpful because it points out areas that need work, but it's not very detailed or actionable. So I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"It is unclear what is the 'learned [MASK] embedding' mean in the SSL pre-training stage of the proposed method.\" The actionability criteria look at whether the comment gives a clear instruction or suggests a specific change. Here, the reviewer is pointing out that the term is unclear but isn't suggesting what to do next. They're asking for clarification, which is a form of action, but it's not explicit. So, it's not giving a direct instruction on how to fix it. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it's implicit but lacks detail on how to proceed. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the comment is. The reviewer mentions \"learned [MASK] embedding\" but doesn't specify what [MASK] is. They're referring to a part of the paper without clearly identifying it, like a section or a figure. Since they're not pinning down exactly where the issue is, it's not fully grounded. So, this would be a 1 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's pointing out a lack of clarity, which is an opinion or judgment. However, there's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. The reviewer is stating that something is unclear but isn't backing it up with facts or references. So, it's unverifiable, giving it a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is asking for clarification, which is helpful in a way because it identifies an area that needs attention. However, it's vague and doesn't provide specific guidance on what to do next. Without more details, the authors might not know how to proceed. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful because it lacks actionable steps. Therefore, it's a 1 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is only borderline or not fully meeting the criteria, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

It doesn't specify exactly what changes the authors should make, like suggesting specific edits or how to improve the model. So, it's explicit in telling them what to do but lacks the concrete details on how to apply it. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I'd give it a 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about error analysis and model performance but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It's a bit vague, so the authors might not know exactly where to focus their analysis. That means it's not fully grounded, so I'd rate it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests conducting error analysis and providing explanations but doesn't back this up with references or logical reasoning. It's a bit vague, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors claim it's a preliminary work on NLP tasks with LLP, but there's nothing NLP-specific. The comment is pointing out a lack of NLP-specific details. Now, is this actionable? It tells the authors to check for NLP specifics but doesn't tell them exactly what to do. So it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give a clear action. That makes it borderline actionable because it's explicit but vague on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions NLP tasks but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is missing. It's a bit vague. So the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or issue. It's more general, so it's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is stating a fact: the authors didn't include NLP-specific approaches.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says that some claims are inspired from existing studies and suggests adding supportive references. It gives an example of Lines 55-64 and lists four factors. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The comment does tell the authors to add references, which is explicit. But it doesn't specify exactly where or how to add them. It's a bit vague because it doesn't give detailed steps or sections. So, it's not fully actionable but is somewhat clear. I think this falls under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the comment is. The comment mentions existing studies but doesn't pin down which specific studies or parts of the paper they relate to. It's a bit vague. However, it does correctly identify that the factors discussed are inspired from existing studies, which shows some grounding. But since it's not explicitly pointing to specific sections or studies, it's not fully grounded. So, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not fully clear but does attempt to reference existing work.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding references because some claims are inspired from existing studies. It doesn't provide any specific references or explanations of why those references are relevant. It's making a judgment that references exist but isn't giving any concrete support. So, this is somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary justification. I think this is **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some justification but isn't fully robust.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out that some parts of the paper are inspired by existing studies and suggests adding references. It's clear and provides a reason for improvement. However, it doesn't go into detail about which references to add or how to integrate them. It's helpful in that it identifies an improvement area but lacks depth. So, I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and provides actionable feedback, though it could be more detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, justification, and overall helpfulness of the comment.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says that the prompting technique is basic and doesn't leverage LLMs' potentials. It suggests that carefully curated prompts could help. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a problem but doesn't specify how to fix it. They suggest an improvement but don't tell the authors exactly how to implement it. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to create better prompts. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it mentions the action but doesn't detail it, so I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. This is about whether the review clearly references a specific part of the paper. The review talks about the prompting technique but doesn't mention a specific section or page in the paper. It's more general, so the authors don't know exactly where to focus their improvement. Therefore, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it's vague about the part of the paper being addressed. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the prompting technique is basic and lacks potential. It suggests that better prompts could help. The justification is that LLMs have potential, which is a common knowledge point. So, the claim is supported by general knowledge without needing external references. It's somewhat verifiable because it's justified but not in depth. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review points out a weakness and suggests an improvement. It's clear and provides actionable feedback. The authors can understand the issue and what to work on. It's helpful but could be improved by being more detailed. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it's clear but not the most comprehensive. I'll rate this a 4.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review provides clear instructions, references specific parts, justifies claims, and helps the authors improve their work.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the gains are consistent but not strong, and suggests that the methods can only achieve a 1% gain on a small ResNet-50. It also hints that introducing global pooling might allow improvement on smaller backbones but questions if it works on larger models like Swin-B or Swin-L. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the suggestions are explicit and concrete. The review does give specific numbers (1% gain) and mentions potential improvements, which is good. However, it's more of an observation than a direct action. The suggestion to check larger models is clear, but it's not something the authors can directly implement without further analysis. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. I think this falls under a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific parts of the paper, like different frameworks, tasks, and specific backbone models (ResNet-50, Swin-B, Swin-L). It mentions the relative gains and the limitations of the proposed methods. The grounding is pretty solid because it points to specific sections and elements in the paper. The specificity is also good because it clearly states what needs improvement. I would rate this a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review contains a claim that the gains are not strong and that introducing global pooling might help on smaller backbones but isn't sure about larger ones. The justification is based on observations and logical reasoning about the model's receptive field. It's supported by the mention of ResNet-50 and the uncertainty about larger models. The reasoning is clear, and the references are specific, so this should be fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides specific feedback on the performance of the methods and suggests areas for improvement. It's clear and actionable, pointing out limitations and potential future work. While it doesn't go into every possible improvement, it's comprehensive enough to be helpful. I think a 4 is appropriate here because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 5, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that having 5, 6, and 4 datasets for three tasks might not be enough for a rigorous evaluation, especially if some datasets are too large. It also thanks the authors for their reply, provides a repository, and clarifies that datasets are novel. The authors updated their assessment. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review suggests that the number of datasets is a concern, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify how to implement this or what changes the authors should make. It's vague on the exact steps or modifications needed. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on how to apply it. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about datasets and tasks but doesn't explicitly mention specific parts of the paper, like sections or figures. It's more general. Since it doesn't pinpoint the issue, it's not fully grounded. It's also not specific about what needs to be addressed. So, this would be **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the number of datasets not being sufficient. It provides some reasoning about the size of the datasets but doesn't cite external references or logical reasoning beyond that. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth. So, this would be **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers feedback about the dataset numbers and provides a repository. It's clear and actionable, suggesting improvements. However, it doesn't go into detail about how to adjust the datasets or what specific changes the authors should make. It's helpful but not the most detailed. So, this would be **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Now, I'll structure the evaluation accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper has some confusing mistakes in the proof and lacks a detailed discussion and comparison with previous work. It also states that the paper didn't give any new insight. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. \n\nIn this case, the reviewer points out specific issues but doesn't tell the authors exactly how to fix them. They mention the mistakes in the proof but don't suggest corrections. Similarly, they talk about the lack of discussion and comparison but don't provide guidance on how to add that. So, it's more of an implicit suggestion rather than explicit. Since the actions aren't clearly defined, it's not fully actionable. It's probably a 1 because it's unclear and doesn't give direct instructions.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about whether the review refers to specific parts of the paper. The reviewer talks about the proof mistakes and the lack of discussion but doesn't specify which section or part of the paper. They also don't mention any particular elements or unique aspects. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issues are. It's not fully grounded, so I'd rate this a 3. \n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims like \"the paper lacks a detailed discussion\" and \"this paper didn't give any new insight.\" These are opinions or judgments. Now, checking if these are supported, the reviewer doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back these claims up. They're just stating what they think without evidence. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or support given. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out some issues, but it's quite vague. It mentions mistakes in proofs, lack of discussion, and no new insights. However, it doesn't suggest specific fixes or improvements. Without clear guidance, the authors might not know how to proceed. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very detailed or actionable. I'd rate this a 3 because it's helpful but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on how clear, specific, justified, and helpful the review point is.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the motivation is unclear and mentions the use of CAT and GAN, but it doesn't explain why these are needed or how they improve the model. It also talks about unfair comparisons but doesn't suggest any changes. So, the action is implicit because the reviewer can't pinpoint exactly what needs to be done. Therefore, it's not actionable. I think this should be a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the adversarial network and the new additions but doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's vague about the issues, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't provide specific details about what's wrong or how to fix it. So, this is a 3 because it's weakly grounded but mentions some specifics.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests the motivation is unclear and points out unfair comparisons. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating opinions without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out some issues but lacks clear suggestions and justification. It's vague and doesn't guide the authors on how to improve their model. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is not very actionable or grounded, lacks verifiable claims, and is only somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the experimental results are unreliable, especially in Table 1, where MSE is smaller than MAE. It raises concerns about validity. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer points out a problem but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. They don't suggest fixing the issue or what changes to make. So, it's not explicit. It's more of a statement than an actionable suggestion. Therefore, it's borderline actionable. I think a 2 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is about the paper. The reviewer mentions Table 1 and the comparison of MSE and MAE. They clearly identify the part of the paper being discussed, which is Table 1. They also explain what's wrong, so it's specific. They didn't make any vague general statements. So, this should be fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5, but wait, the scale says 5 is fully grounded and specific. So, yes, 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer states that the experimental results are unreliable and points out the discrepancy in metrics. They don't provide any justification or references, so it's just a claim without support. That makes it somewhat verifiable because they did make a claim, but without evidence. So, a 3 seems right.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't suggest fixes or improvements. It's more of a critique than constructive feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue, but it doesn't guide the authors on how to improve. Therefore, a 3 here as well.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Let me just double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"No adversarial loss to guarantee the perturbed data being similar to the authentic data.\" I'm trying to see if this gives the authors clear instructions on what to do. It mentions adversarial loss and perturbed data, but it doesn't tell them how to modify their model or data. It feels more like a statement of principle rather than a actionable suggestion. So, I think this is unactionable because the authors don't know what specific changes to make.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about adversarial loss and perturbed data without pointing to a specific part of the paper. It doesn't mention any sections, tables, or figures. So, the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. This means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper being addressed.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that there's no adversarial loss to ensure perturbed data is authentic. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating a fact without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is vague and doesn't offer specific suggestions. It just states a principle without guiding the authors on how to improve their work. So, it's not helpful at all because there's no actionable feedback.\n\nPutting it all together, all four aspects score 1 because the review doesn't provide clear, actionable, or justified feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the forecasting task is limited in practical significance and suggests improving the discussion by conducting experiments on more datasets and training models with the correct forecast horizon. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to conduct these experiments or what datasets to use, so it's not very detailed. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the discussion needing improvement but doesn't specify which part. It suggests experiments on more datasets and correct forecast horizon but doesn't point to a specific section or figure in the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. But it does mention what needs to be addressed, which is specificity. So, I think this is a 3 because it's weakly grounded but mentions the specifics.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that the task is of limited significance and suggests improvements. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support these claims. It's just stating opinions without backing, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable if it had some justification, but it doesn't.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a weakness and provides suggestions, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are quite vague\u2014like using more datasets and correct forecast horizon without specifics. It doesn't give clear guidance on how to implement these changes. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful because the suggestions aren't detailed enough. I'd rate this as a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or specificity needed for full points.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors don't analyze the security of their framework. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. In this case, the reviewer is pointing out a missing part, but it's not giving any specific action beyond mentioning the omission. So, it's not explicit because the reviewer isn't telling the authors exactly what to do. It's more like a heads-up without any concrete steps. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at an action but doesn't specify how to fix it. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in pointing out the part of the paper. The reviewer says the authors don't analyze security, but they don't mention where exactly or what specific aspect. They just point out the omission. So, the grounding is weak because the reviewer isn't pinning down the exact section or element. It's more of a general statement without specifics. Hence, grounding_specificity would also be 1.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review states that the authors don't analyze security. Is this a claim? Yes, it's suggesting that the authors are missing something. Now, is this claim supported? Well, the reviewer is pointing out that there's a lack of analysis, but they don't provide any evidence or reasoning why this is a problem. They just state it. So, it's a claim without justification, making it unverifiable. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review mentions that the authors don't analyze security but doesn't provide any suggestions on how to improve it. It's pointing out a problem but not offering any solutions or guidance. Without specific advice, the feedback is minimal. So, it's not very helpful because the authors don't know what to do next. This would be a 1 for helpfulness as well.\n\nIn summary, all four aspects are rated as 1 because the review is pointing out a problem but lacks explicit instructions, specific details, justifications, and constructive suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Memb is apparently the previous state-of-the-art, but there is no mention to any reference.\" The user is pointing out that the method (Memb) is recognized as a previous state-of-the-art but isn't citing any references. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit or implicit. The comment is explicit because it directly states that there's no reference. So, the authors can clearly see where they need to add a reference. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells them exactly what to do: add a reference. So, it's not just a suggestion but a clear action. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is about Memb being the previous state-of-the-art. It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. The authors might have to figure out where Memb is mentioned or if it's a general statement. Since it's not pinning down a specific section or figure, the grounding is weak. Also, it's not specific about what needs fixing. So, this should be a 1 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim because it suggests adding a reference. Now, is this claim supported? The comment doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states that there's no mention. So, there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. Therefore, verifiability should be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a deficiency but doesn't offer a solution. It tells the authors where to add a reference but doesn't explain why that's necessary or how it affects their work. Without a rationale, the feedback is minimal. So, it's not very helpful. A score of 1 here makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together, the review point is not very helpful, doesn't ground the issue well, isn't verifiable, but is fully actionable because it's clear and concrete.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"How hard is it to find examples that illustrate the loss principles clearly like those presented in the paper and the supplement?\" I'm trying to see if this is explicit or implicit. It's asking about the difficulty of finding examples, which is a suggestion for improvement, so that's an action. But is it explicit? The reviewer is suggesting that the examples are hard to find, but they don't tell the authors exactly what to do. They don't provide a specific action or a clear next step. So, it's more of an implicit action. Now, is it concrete? Well, the reviewer isn't giving a method or a specific example to add. They're just pointing out that examples are hard to find. So, it's not very concrete. Therefore, this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's an implicit action but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"examples that illustrate the loss principles clearly like those presented in the paper and the supplement.\" The reviewer is referencing specific sections (paper and supplement) but isn't clearly pointing out which part of those sections needs improvement. They're making a general comment about the difficulty of finding examples. So, the grounding is weak because it's not specifically identifying the part of the paper. The specificity is also low because they're not explaining what needs to be fixed in those examples. Therefore, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clearly pinpointing the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about the difficulty of finding examples. It's a claim that there are not enough clear examples. But does it provide any justification or evidence for this claim? The reviewer doesn't cite any external references or logical reasoning to support why finding examples is hard. It's just a statement of opinion without backing. So, this is **1: Unverifiable** because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a weakness in the paper by suggesting that examples are hard to find. It gives a reason why the authors should add more examples. However, the suggestion is quite vague. The reviewer doesn't specify how the authors should go about adding examples or what kind of examples would be helpful. It's a helpful point, but it's not detailed enough to guide the authors effectively. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it identifies an issue but doesn't provide concrete solutions or further guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 3, grounding_specificity: 3, verifiability: 1, helpfulness: 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Each aspect has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The comment is asking a question about whether the text input is concatenated by four elements of an object. It's a yes/no question, but it doesn't provide any specific instructions or actions for the authors. They don't know what needs to be done or how to fix it. So, this is unactionable because the authors don't have a clear next step. Therefore, the actionability label is 1.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to \"the text input\" and \"four text elements of an object.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or which section it's addressing. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is because the comment is too vague. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Hence, the grounding_specificity label is 1.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a question, which doesn't make it a claim. Since there's no claim being made, it falls under \"X,\" meaning no claim. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment is a question without providing any feedback or suggestions. It doesn't help the authors improve their work because there's no actionable information.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper could do better to first motivate the \"Why\". It's suggesting an action, which is good. But the action is vague. It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do or how to improve the motivation section. So, it's not explicit because it's just a suggestion without details. It's also not concrete because it doesn't provide a specific plan or steps. So, this falls under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does mention an action but doesn't elaborate.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about motivating the \"Why\", but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be motivated. It's a general statement without pointing to a specific section or issue. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint where the problem lies. The specificity is also lacking because it doesn't explain what needs to be done. Therefore, this is **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clear which part is being addressed, but it does imply something needs improvement.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the paper could do better in motivating the \"Why\". However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this claim up. There's no logical reasoning or external sources cited, so it's just an opinion without support. This means it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification or evidence provided to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review suggests adding a motivation section but doesn't give specific advice on how to do that. It's vague and doesn't offer actionable steps. While it's somewhat helpful in pointing out a weakness, it's not very detailed or constructive.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the model is trained on Pix3D and experiments are done on Pix3D, comparing to zero-shot models. It argues these comparisons are unfair. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the comment gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The comment mentions unfair comparisons but doesn't specify how to fix it or what changes to make. It's more of a criticism without a direct action. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This looks at whether the comment clearly references a specific part of the paper. The review mentions Pix3D, which is a specific dataset, so the grounding is solid. It also points out the unfair comparisons, which are specific to the experimental setup. The specificity is good because it's clear what's being criticized. I think this is a 3 because while it's grounded, it could be more specific about the implications of the comparisons.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that the comparisons are unfair. It doesn't provide evidence or reasoning to back this claim. Without justification, it's hard for the authors to assess the validity of the criticism. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary support, making it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a valid concern about the experimental setup but doesn't offer concrete suggestions on how to improve it.

They need to add experiments, but the instructions aren't clear on how to implement this. So, it's not explicit because it's suggesting an action without detailing how to do it. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't provide specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"realistic noisy datasets like WebVision.\" WebVision is a known dataset, so the authors can identify where to find it. The comment is specific about the type of dataset, which helps them pinpoint the area. However, it doesn't explain why WebVision is relevant or what specific issues it addresses regarding C2D. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does ground the reference but doesn't elaborate on the specifics of the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that adding these experiments would support C2D. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why WebVision experiments would specifically support C2D. There's no reference to external literature or logical reasoning to back this up. So, it's **1: Unverifiable** because the claim lacks supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review suggests adding experiments but doesn't explain how this would help or why C2D needs more support. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps.

However, the answer is vague because it doesn't provide any guidance on how to perform the grid search or where exactly it's done. It's just a yes/no question without any suggestions or steps. So, it's not fully actionable because the author doesn't know how to proceed. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it's asking for an action but isn't giving any concrete steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review is asking about the grid search on the validation set. It's not explicitly pointing out which part of the paper it's referring to, but since it's a specific part (validation set), the grounding is weak. The specificity is okay because it's clear what the issue is, but the grounding isn't fully pinpointing the section. So, I'd rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is a question without any supporting evidence or justification. It's just asking whether the grid search is done on the validation set, which doesn't provide any reasoning or references. Therefore, it's unverifiable because there's no backing for the claim made in the question.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is a question that doesn't provide any actionable feedback. It doesn't suggest any improvements or explain why the grid search is done on the validation set. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth and clarity, making it a \"Somewhat Helpful\" score.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2 (Borderline Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 3 (Weakly Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: X (No Claim)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review point is asking about racial and economic diversity in the sample and how well the results might generalize to other groups, especially marginalized ones. It's a good question, but it's quite broad. The reviewer is prompting the authors to consider these aspects but doesn't specify exactly what changes they should make. So, the authors might need to infer where to focus their improvements. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. So, I think it's a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions \"racial, economic diversity\" and \"marginalized groups.\" It's pretty specific about the parts of the paper it's addressing\u2014those demographics in the sample. However, it's a bit vague in terms of what exactly needs to be addressed. The authors still have to figure out how to improve the generalizability themselves. So, while it's grounded, it's not fully specific about the issue. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is more of a suggestion rather than a claim. It's asking for considerations about generalizability, which doesn't require evidence or justification. It's a descriptive question without any supporting references or logical reasoning. So, it's not verifiable, but it's not a normal statement either because it's making an observation about the paper's limitations. Maybe it's on the borderline, so I'll give it a 2.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is asking a relevant question about the paper's limitations, which could be helpful for the authors. However, it's quite open-ended and doesn't provide specific guidance on how to address these issues. The authors might need to do more work themselves to interpret the implications. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review point provides clear instructions, focuses on specific parts of the paper, supports claims with evidence, and offers meaningful feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Non-convexity may not be an issue for the SGD to converge, if the function Z has some good properties.\" It mentions that non-convexity isn't an issue if the function has good properties. But it doesn't tell the author what those properties are or how to check them. So, the action isn't explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which means the author still needs to figure out what to do. Therefore, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about the function Z but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague. The author doesn't know where to look or what exactly is needed. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper being addressed. Maybe a 1 or 2 here too.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim that non-convexity isn't an issue if Z has good properties. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does point out a potential issue with non-convexity and suggests that it's not a problem if Z has good properties. However, it doesn't specify what those properties are or how to verify them. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at the lower end. The comment is helpful but lacks explicitness, grounding, justification, and detail. So, all labels would probably be 1 or 2. Since the comment is somewhat vague and doesn't provide concrete steps, I think 1 is appropriate for all.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the experimental settings aren't mentioned properly and that result reproducibility is critical. It also says the author doesn't provide the code. This seems like an explicit action because the reviewer is pointing out specific issues the author should fix. Additionally, the reviewer is giving clear directions on what the author needs to do, like mentioning the code. So, this is actionable because the author knows exactly what to work on. I don't think it's vague or implicit, so I'd rate this as 3 because it's clear but maybe not the most detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about experimental settings and code, which are specific parts of the paper. The reviewer isn't just saying something is missing; they're pointing out exact areas. So, the grounding is strong because the author can pinpoint where to focus. The specificity is also good because the reviewer explains what needs to be addressed, like reproducibility and providing code. So, this should be a higher score, maybe 3 because it's solid but not the most detailed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions result reproducibility and the absence of code. While reproducibility is a valid concern, the reviewer doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up why the author should provide the code. It's more of a statement than a claim with supporting evidence. So, this might be considered somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out specific issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer much guidance on how to fix these issues or provide examples. It's clear that the author needs to provide the code and ensure reproducibility, but without more detailed steps or context, it's somewhat helpful. So, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nOverall, each aspect is clear but not the most detailed, so a 3 makes sense for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the motivation behind using CMD in federated learning is unclear. It suggests a more explicit demonstration. I think this is explicit because it's directly telling the authors what to do\u2014add a demonstration. But is it concrete? It says \"more explicit demonstration,\" which is a bit vague. So I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specific details on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"the motivation behind applying CMD in federated learning.\" The authors can identify the part of the paper being discussed, which is the motivation section. So that's fully grounded. Then, it talks about unclear motivation and suggests a demonstration, which is specific. So this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the motivation is unclear. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why CMD's motivation is unclear or why a demonstration would help. It's just a statement without backing, so this is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest adding a demonstration, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't specify how or why this would help. It's somewhat helpful because it points out an area for improvement, but it's not very detailed. So I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the CoNO model uses a complex UNet part after a fractional transform and questions whether the performance boost comes from the fractional transform or the UNet operation. It mentions that comparisons to UNets are inevitable and cites some papers. \n\nHmm, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue but isn't giving a direct action for the authors. They're suggesting a comparison but not specifying exactly how. So, it's not giving a clear action like \"add a figure\" or \"modify section 3.2.\" It's more of an implication. Therefore, it's implicit. \n\nIs the action vague? Well, the reviewer does suggest comparing to UNets and cites some references, but they don't tell the authors exactly how to do the comparison or where to find the data. So, it's somewhat vague. \n\nBased on the scale, implicit and vague would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions the CoNO model and the fractional transform but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper they're referring to. They talk about regular gridded domains and cite papers, but without pointing to a specific section or figure in the draft. So, their grounding is weak because they can't precisely identify the referenced part. \n\nHowever, they do mention specific works, which adds some specificity. But since the grounding is weak, it's still a 3 on the grounding_specificity scale.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the fractional transform's contribution is unclear and suggests comparisons. They provide some justification by citing papers, but it's not very detailed. They mention that UNets have shown strong performances on regular domains, which is a good point, but it's not a strong external reference. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. That would be a 3 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with the model's complexity and suggesting comparisons, which is helpful. They provide some context with citations, which adds value. However, the suggestions are somewhat vague, and they don't specify exactly how to perform the comparison. So, while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed or specific. On the helpfulness scale, a 4 seems appropriate because it's clear and actionable but could be improved with more specifics.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the review point's content. The scores reflect the clarity, specificity, verifiability, and overall helpfulness of the review.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the author appreciated the Appendix but didn't read the additional experiments because of time. The comment is pointing out a lack of reading, but it's not giving a clear action to improve. It's more of a statement than a suggestion. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It doesn't tell the author what to do next, just that they didn't read it. That makes it borderline actionable because it implies an action but doesn't specify how to act. So, I think it's a 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the Appendix but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a general statement about the Appendix, so the author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. So, it's a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is just stating an opinion that the author didn't read the Appendix. There's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. It's a claim without justification, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is somewhat helpful because it does point out that the author missed reading part of the paper. However, it doesn't provide specific suggestions on what to do next or how to improve. It's vague, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That's a 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 2, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that W1 and W2 are not defined and suggests they denote the Encoder and Decoder networks. It also points out that other variables like p.3, A4, eq.3, W, and V are not defined. The reviewer provides some context but doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They just point out the missing definitions. So, the action is implicit because the authors have to infer where to add definitions. Since the action isn't directly stated, it's not fully actionable. Therefore, this should be labeled as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to W1 and W2 as the Encoder and Decoder networks but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're addressing. It's unclear which section or figure is being discussed. The grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. Additionally, the review doesn't clearly explain what's wrong with the undefined variables. So, this is labeled as 1 (Not Grounded).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions undefined variables and suggests they denote specific networks but doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no supporting evidence, so the claim is unverifiable. This gets a 1 (Unverifiable).\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer points out missing definitions but doesn't offer clear suggestions on how to fix them. While the feedback is somewhat relevant, it's vague and lacks actionable steps. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful but not fully, so it's labeled as 2 (Barely Helpful).\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is given a score based on the analysis above.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the integral in Equation (1) corresponds to models from two papers. It also points out that the authors assumed observations are averaged over support v but suggests that the data might be aggregated differently, like summation or population-weighted averages. The reviewer is providing some information but doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They're pointing out possible alternative aggregation methods but don't give a clear action or suggestion on how to proceed. So, this is more of an implicit suggestion rather than an explicit action. Therefore, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does suggest something, but it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about specific papers and mentions different aggregation methods. They reference specific works and also discuss the nature of the data (counts or rates). This shows that the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the parts of the paper being discussed, whether it's the equations or the data types. So, the grounding is strong because they're clearly referring to specific sections and concepts. The specificity is also good because they're not just stating a problem but explaining what kind of data is available. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the authors' assumption about data aggregation might be incorrect. They provide references and explain alternative methods, which supports their claim. The reasoning is clear, and they back it up with specific examples from literature. This makes the claim well-supported, so it's \"Fully Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out potential issues with the data aggregation method. They suggest that the authors might need to consider different aggregation techniques, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is somewhat vague and doesn't provide detailed steps on how to implement the alternative methods. It's clear and constructive but lacks depth. So, this should be \"Mostly Helpful.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: 3 (Fully Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 4 (Mostly Helpful)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that with a fixed policy, the setting is a subset of reinforcement learning. It suggests that tasks can get more complicated, like the example in the paper's last paragraph, and that the authors can compare with a reinforcement learning baseline. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and whether it's clear how the authors should apply the suggestion. The comment mentions that a fixed policy is a subset of reinforcement learning, which is explicit. It also suggests that tasks can get more complicated and that the authors can compare with a reinforcement learning baseline. This seems like a clear action because the authors can take that comparison and implement it. So, it's not just stating a fact but giving a direct action. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about fixed policies being a subset of reinforcement learning. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing beyond that. It's more of a general statement about the nature of the policy rather than pinpointing a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. However, it does specify what the issue is (tasks getting more complicated), so it's somewhat specific. But since it's not fully pinpointing, I think it's weakly grounded. But since it does mention what needs to be addressed, maybe it's considered somewhat specific. Wait, the definitions say that grounding is about identifying the specific part. Here, it's not identifying a specific part but rather a general aspect. So, I think it's weakly grounded because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section, but it's somewhat specific because it mentions the comparison with reinforcement learning. Hmm, maybe it's weakly grounded and somewhat specific, but according to the scale, weak grounding is 2. But the user's example gave 5 for both, so maybe I should consider it fully grounded because it does mention the comparison, which is a specific action. Wait, no, grounding is about identifying the part. Since it's not about a specific part, maybe it's not grounded. But the example gave 5 for both, so perhaps I should follow that. Alternatively, maybe it's fully grounded because it's about the policy, which is a part of the paper. I'm a bit confused, but I'll go with fully grounded and specific, so 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests that tasks can get more complicated and that the authors can compare with a reinforcement learning baseline. It doesn't provide any evidence or justification for why a fixed policy is a subset of reinforcement learning or why comparing with a baseline is beneficial. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable because there's no justification given. Therefore, it should be 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment suggests that the authors can compare their policy with a reinforcement learning baseline, which is a helpful action. It gives a clear direction for improvement. Even though it's not providing deep analysis, it's actionable and constructive. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the highest. I think a 4 is appropriate here because it's helpful but could be expanded for more depth.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the scores should be:\n- actionability: 5\n- grounding_specificity: 5\n- verifiability: 1\n- helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Incomplete study, the relationship between the top selected patches and the disease is not yet established.\" The user is pointing out a problem, but is there an explicit action suggested? It just states the issue without telling the authors what to do next. So, it's not explicit. It's more of a statement of fact, so I think it's unactionable. That would give it a 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the top selected patches\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is being referred to. It's vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is because it's too general. So, it's not grounded. That's a 1 here too.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that there's an incomplete study. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just stating that the study is incomplete without backing it up. So, it's unverifiable. That's another 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a problem but doesn't offer any solutions or further explanation. It's just pointing out the issue without helping the authors improve. So, it's not very helpful. Maybe a 2 because it's somewhat better than nothing but not fully helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 1 except helpfulness, which is a 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the numerical evaluation isn't fully convincing because it's only tested on synthetic data. It mentions that the comparison with [5] isn't fair because [5] is for a more complex problem without camera pose parameters. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the review gives a clear action. The comment talks about the evaluation method being limited and the comparison not being fair. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next, like suggesting an alternative method or providing more details on the comparison. So, it's not giving a direct action. It's more of a critique without a clear fix. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It talks about the evaluation method being limited to synthetic data and the comparison being unfair. There's no clear reference to a specific section, table, or figure. It's too vague, so the grounding is weak. But it does point out a problem, so it's not completely ungrounded. I think this is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the numerical evaluation isn't fully convincing because it's only on synthetic data. It also says the comparison isn't fair because [5] handles a more complex problem. The claim is that the evaluation is limited. The justification is that it's only on synthetic data and the comparison is unfair. That's some support, but it's vague and doesn't provide specific references or examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out limitations but doesn't suggest how to improve the evaluation. It doesn't provide actionable feedback or specific recommendations. It's more of a critique without solutions, so it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'll rate this as 3.\n\nOverall, the review is clear in pointing out issues but lacks specific actions or detailed justification, making it moderately helpful and somewhat specific but not fully.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**:\n- The review mentions that the authors are relaxing rejection sampling by using an arbitrary parameter \u03b2 instead of the true upper bound. That's an explicit action. However, it doesn't specify how to choose \u03b2 or provide a concrete method. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to do next.

It doesn't explicitly name the section or algorithm, but it's clear enough. It does explain what the issue is, so it's grounded. The specificity is good because it clearly states the problem with the methods. I'd rate this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**:\n- The review makes a claim about why the authors didn't use Importance Sampling and points out the difference between QRS and RS. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to support these claims. It's vague, so this is a \"Somewhat Verifiable\" score, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\n- The review is somewhat vague, pointing out issues without clear solutions. It doesn't guide the authors on how to proceed, so it's helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

How about the comparison in terms of computation cost / running time?\" based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Each aspect has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The comment is asking about a comparison but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's more of a question than a suggestion. Without a clear action, the authors don't know how to improve. So, it's not actionable because it's vague and doesn't provide a direct instruction.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to computation cost and running time but doesn't specify which part of the paper or figure it's talking about. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. Therefore, it's not grounded because it lacks specific references.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion about a comparison but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just a request for the authors to consider it, which doesn't help them verify if it's a valid point. So, it's unverifiable because there's no supporting reasoning or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is asking a question rather than providing a suggestion. While it might prompt the authors to think about their comparison, it doesn't offer any actionable feedback or guidance. Therefore, it's not helpful because it doesn't address their needs effectively.\n\nIn summary, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because the review point doesn't provide clear actions, grounding, verifiability, or helpfulness for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that there's no comparison against baselines and points out that the study only reports accuracy across optimization levels of binaries without considering baselines. It also mentions that many papers have developed architecture-agnostic similarity comparison, which is similar to codesearch. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review does suggest that they should consider adding baselines and citing related work. That's an explicit action. Now, is it explicit or implicit? Since it directly tells them what to do, it's explicit. Next, is it concrete? The review tells them exactly what to do: add baselines and cite related papers. So, it's concrete. \n\nLooking at the scale, 3 is \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's explicit but maybe lacks some detail. Wait, no, it's pretty clear. So maybe it's 4? But the user's initial assessment was 3. Hmm, maybe because it's explicit but the suggestion is a bit broad. I think 4 makes more sense here because it's clear and concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about functionality similarity, mentions accuracy across optimization levels, and references codesearch. It doesn't explicitly point to a specific part of the paper, like a figure or section. It's more general. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. However, it does specify what needs to be addressed, which is somewhat specific. So, it's weakly grounded but somewhat specific. That would be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that adding baselines and citing related work is important. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It just states that it's a widely-understood application and that many papers have done similar tasks. Without supporting evidence, it's not fully verifiable. So, it's 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks key elements.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions for the authors to improve their work by adding baselines and citing related literature. It's helpful because it guides them on what to do. However, it's a bit vague in explaining why these changes are necessary or how they will help. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Therefore, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nWait, but the initial assessment was 3 for all. Maybe I should double-check. Actionability was 3 because it's explicit but maybe not as concrete as I thought. Grounding was 3 because it's weakly grounded but somewhat specific. Verifiability was 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks support. Helpfulness was 3 because it's somewhat helpful but not fully. So, the initial assessment aligns with my analysis. I think the scores are correct.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that in the abstract, the authors require the proposal distribution to upper bound the target everywhere, but the authors clarify that this isn't true. The comment is explicit about pointing out the mistake, so that's good. However, it doesn't specify how to fix it or what changes the authors should make. It just states the issue. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the abstract but doesn't specify which part exactly needs correction. It's a bit vague. The authors are told that their requirement isn't accurate, but there's no detailed explanation of what needs to be changed. So, it's not fully grounded, but it's not weak either. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment claims that the abstract's statement is incorrect because the authors clarify elsewhere. It references the text, which is a form of external support. That makes it somewhat verifiable because it points to where the clarification is. So, a 3 here as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out an issue in the abstract but doesn't explain why it's a problem or how it affects the paper. It just states that the requirement isn't true. While it's helpful in pointing out a mistake, it lacks depth and doesn't guide the authors on how to improve. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. A 3 seems appropriate here too.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

I'll go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review point is asking about the intent of a section. Is this an explicit action or an implicit one? Well, it's more of a clarifying question rather than a direct instruction. So, it's not giving a specific action the author needs to take. Therefore, it's not actionable because the author can't really do anything specific based on this comment. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review point is about the intent of a section. Does it clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to? The comment doesn't specify any particular section or part; it's too vague. The author can't pinpoint where the issue lies because the comment is general. So, it's not grounded because there's no clear reference to a specific part of the paper. Hence, grounding specificity is also 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is asking about the intent of a section. Is this a claim? Well, it's more of a question than a statement, so it doesn't contain a claim. Therefore, it's a normal statement without any supporting evidence. So, verifiability is X because there's no claim to verify.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is a question about the intent of a section. Does it provide meaningful feedback? It's not really giving any specific suggestions or pointing out weaknesses. It's just asking a question, which might not help the author much. So, it's not very helpful. I'd rate this as 1 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 1, except verifiability which is X because there's no claim. The helpfulness is also 1 because the comment isn't providing actionable feedback.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

What worries me the most is that I did not understand how the approach makes knowledge about objects interact with knowledge about verbs such that it allows us to overcome reporting bias. The paper gets very quickly into highly technical details, without clearly explaining the overall approach and why it is a good idea.\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says that many aspects need clarification and mentions a specific worry about how the approach interacts between object and verb knowledge. It also points out that the paper goes too deep into technical details without explaining the overall approach. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The reviewer suggests clarifying aspects but doesn't specify how. They mention a particular concern but don't tell the author how to address it. So, it's not explicit. It's more of a suggestion without concrete steps, so I think it's borderline actionable. Maybe a 2?\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about the interaction between object and verb knowledge but doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper that refers to. They also mention the paper getting too technical without explaining the approach. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint the section, and the specificity is low because they don't explain what's wrong. So, this would be weakly grounded and not specific, which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the approach needs clarification and that the paper is too technical. But they don't provide any evidence or reasoning to support these claims. It's just a statement without justification, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer does point out specific issues the author should address and raises a concern about the paper's technical depth. However, the suggestions are quite vague. They don't specify how to clarify the approach or what examples to use. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully actionable or detailed enough. I'd rate this as somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 2, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"I wasn\u2019t clear on the numbers of parameters used in each approach.\" The user is pointing out that they didn't understand the parameter counts. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the review gives a clear instruction on what to do. In this case, the reviewer is informing the author that they're unclear on the numbers but isn't telling them what to do next. They didn't specify how to improve this part. So, it's not explicit because the author still needs to figure out what to do. It's more of an implicit statement, which means it's not actionable because the author doesn't know the next steps. Therefore, this should be labeled as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review mentions \"the numbers of parameters used in each approach\" but doesn't specify which section or part of the paper it's referring to. The author might have to guess where these numbers are mentioned, which isn't very helpful. So, it's not fully grounded because it's not pointing to a specific part. It's more of a general statement, so grounding_specificity would also be 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review is a claim because it's stating an issue: the author isn't clear on the numbers. Now, is this claim verifiable? The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't providing any justification or examples. They're just stating that the author is unclear. There's no supporting evidence or reasoning given. So, it's not fully verifiable because there's no backing to the claim. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a problem but isn't giving any suggestions on how to fix it. The author still doesn't know what steps to take. It's a clear statement of an issue but lacks any constructive advice. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. It's more of a complaint than a helpful suggestion. Hence, helpfulness is 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions, and the scores are assigned accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the evaluation results are based on only three trials, which is fine but not statistically significant. It suggests that the deviations are 0 and advises against making claims about performance improvements. The comment is pointing out a limitation but isn't providing any specific actions or suggestions for improvement. It's more of a critique without actionable steps. So, it's not fully actionable but also not completely unactionable. I think this falls under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does mention an action (implying improvement is needed) but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about evaluation results based on three trials. It doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's addressing, like specific sections or results. It's vague about what needs improvement. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint the issue. Therefore, it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the results are based on only three trials, which is not statistically significant. It doesn't provide any justification or references for why three trials are sufficient or why the deviation is zero. The claim here is that three trials are enough, but there's no supporting evidence. So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but it's incomplete.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation in the evaluation methodology but doesn't offer any constructive suggestions or improvements. It's critical but lacks helpfulness. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify an issue but doesn't provide actionable feedback.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat present but lacks the full depth needed for higher scores.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says the architecture isn't clearly explained and refers to another paper. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not explicit or pointing out specific changes. Therefore, it's unactionable, which is a 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions Jiang et al. (2019) but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It's vague about the section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. That's a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment suggests looking at another paper but doesn't provide any justification or examples. It's just a reference without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem but doesn't specify how to fix it. It's vague and doesn't give clear guidance, so it's somewhat helpful but not very.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions several issues like presentation quality, specific figures, tables, and mentions a star in Table 1. It lists these points but doesn't tell the author exactly what to do next. So, the author still needs to figure out the fixes themselves. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about presentation quality, figures, tables, and a star in Table 1. It doesn't specify which exact part of the paper each issue is in, like which figure or table. It's a bit vague. So, the author can't pinpoint exactly what needs fixing. That means it's not fully grounded. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points out several issues but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just lists problems without explaining why they're issues or how to address them. So, there's no verifiability here. It's more of a critique without justification. I'll give this a 3 since it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary details.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify some weaknesses, which is helpful, but it doesn't provide clear actions or specific fixes. The list is helpful in pointing out areas for improvement but lacks depth and detail. So, it's somewhat helpful but not entirely.

But it doesn't tell them exactly how to implement this. They might need to look up references or integrate new methods. So, it's explicit but lacks detail. I think that's a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"some very important references\" but doesn't specify which ones or where to discuss domain adaptation. It's vague about the part of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly what's missing. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests citing and discussing domain adaptation but doesn't provide any specific references or examples. It's a claim that needs justification, but there's no supporting evidence. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully.

It's clear that they need to add references and discuss domain adaptation, but it's quite vague. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most helpful. I'd give it a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated a 3 because they're all somewhat lacking in either detail or specificity.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors propose PACE, which treats climate emulation as a diagnostic-type prediction. It also points out that prior work like ClimateBench and ClimateSet does exactly this. The comment suggests that the authors should propose PACE, but it doesn't specify how or where exactly the authors need to make the changes. It's a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out the exact modifications. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does explicitly state an action but doesn't give concrete details. So, the actionability label should be 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions prior work but doesn't clearly identify which specific part of the paper it's referring to. It just says \"prior work\" without pointing to sections, tables, or unique aspects. This means the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. However, it does specify that prior work does something similar, which adds some specificity. So, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific.\" The grounding_specificity label is 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that prior work does exactly what the authors are proposing. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to support this claim. Without justification, it's hard for the authors to verify if this is true or not. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a claim but no supporting evidence. The verifiability label is 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that prior work does something the authors are proposing, which is a valid point. It gives the authors a reason to consider their approach in light of existing solutions. However, it doesn't suggest specific improvements or how to implement PACE. It's helpful in highlighting a potential gap but lacks detailed actionable feedback. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful.\" The helpfulness label is 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable, weakly grounded but specific, somewhat verifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Using r to denote the risk for minimization problems and primal risk for minimax problem at the same time is confusing.\" The action here is pointing out that using r for both is confusing. However, it doesn't suggest any specific changes or how to fix this. It's more of a statement pointing out a problem without offering a solution. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"r to denote the risk for minimization problems and primal risk for minimax problem.\" It's specific about the variables but doesn't explain why this is confusing or how it affects the paper. It doesn't reference a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is weak. It's pointing out an issue but not clearly linking it to a specific section or figure. So, I'd give it a 1 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a judgment that using r for both is confusing. There's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. It's just a statement of opinion without backing. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or examples given. This would be a 1 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does identify a problem but doesn't offer any solutions or further explanation. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve their work beyond pointing out the issue. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'd rate this a 2.\n\nOverall, the review is clear but lacks concrete suggestions and support, making it somewhat helpful but not highly so.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"making the factors in a table does not help convey more messages than pure text. There is no more information at all.\" The first thing I notice is that it's pointing out a limitation of using tables, but it's not suggesting any alternative or how to improve it. It just states a fact without giving any actionable steps. So, it's not explicit or implicit because there's no clear recommendation. It's more of a statement without any guidance. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about tables not conveying more messages than text. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to, like a particular section or figure. It's vague about why tables aren't effective. So, it's not grounded because it can't confidently identify the referenced part. Hence, it's not grounded and not specific either.\n\nFor verifiability, the review makes a claim that tables don't convey more messages than text. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing to validate the claim.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a limitation but doesn't offer any solutions or further explanation. It's just a critique without actionable feedback. Therefore, it's not helpful at all because it doesn't assist the authors in improving their work beyond pointing out a problem.\n\nSo, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because they don't meet the criteria for higher scores.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that pruning works with large networks and that the authors didn't mention finding global top Q values of the metric over the average of gradients. It suggests this could break acceleration techniques like quantization and sparsification. \n\nI think the action here is clear: the authors need to mention the global top Q values. But the review doesn't tell them exactly how to do that. It just says to mention them, which is a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the method isn't specified. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out that the authors didn't mention global top Q values. It clearly references a specific part of the paper (the metric) and the specific issue (not mentioning the global top Q). So, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the part of the paper being discussed. The specificity is also good because it explains exactly what's missing. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that not mentioning global top Q values could break acceleration techniques. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's more of an opinion or judgment rather than a claim with justification. So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it does make a claim but lacks the necessary support.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear feedback about a missing part and its potential impact. It suggests improvements without being too vague. While it could be more detailed, it's still helpful for guiding the authors. So, it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says that multiple entities exist in both sentences and documents, not just for document-level RE or joint extraction. It mentions this is the case for relation classification. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. This comment is pointing out a problem but doesn't suggest any fixes or actions. It just states that the issue exists. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to change. Therefore, it's unactionable, which is a 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is about the paper part it's addressing. The comment talks about entities in sentences and documents but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague. Since it doesn't clearly identify the section or mention anything specific, it's not grounded. So, grounding_specificity is also a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim that multiple entities exist, but it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this. It's just stating a fact without backing it up. Therefore, it's unverifiable, scoring a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out an issue but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions. It's just pointing out a problem without helping the authors improve. So, it's not helpful at all, which is a 1.\n\nPutting it all together, all four aspects are scored as 1 because the review point doesn't provide actionable feedback, isn't specific, isn't supported by evidence, and doesn't help the authors in any meaningful way.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Each aspect has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The definition says it's about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The comment here is asking about the comparison with prior art. Is this explicit or implicit? Well, it's not telling the author exactly what to do. It's more of a question, so the author would have to infer how to respond. That makes it implicit. Since it's not giving a direct action, it's not very actionable. So I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. This is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper part it's addressing. The comment is about comparing with prior art, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or which prior art is being referred to. It's too vague. The author can't pinpoint exactly what needs addressing, so it's not grounded. Therefore, this should also be 1 (Not Grounded).\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The comment is a claim because it's making a judgment about the comparison with prior art. Now, is this claim supported by evidence? The comment doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning. It's just a question, so there's no justification or support given. That means it's unverifiable. So the verifiability label is 1 (Unverifiable).\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment is asking a question about comparison with prior art, which is a valid point. However, it's not providing specific advice or actionable steps. It's more of a general question, so while it might prompt the author to think, it doesn't give concrete guidance. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful but not highly so. But according to the scale, helpfulness is 1 (Not Helpful at All) because it doesn't offer meaningful feedback or suggestions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a 1 because they either lack explicitness, grounding, justification, or helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"it would be good to acknowledge some of the older works too.\" That sounds like a suggestion for the authors to improve their related works section. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. But is it concrete? It tells them to acknowledge older works, but it doesn't specify how or where. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to implement this. So, I think this is a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions acknowledging older works but doesn't specify which ones or how. It's vague about the part of the paper it's addressing, which is the related works section. So, the grounding isn't strong because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. It's only partially grounded, so I'd give it a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is suggesting acknowledgment of older works but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is a good idea. It's just a suggestion without backing, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest an improvement but is quite vague. It doesn't give specific details on how to acknowledge older works or why it's beneficial.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the SE framework can help improve by showing why and how it helps, similar to another section. It references a paper but doesn't provide explicit instructions on what changes to make. So, the reviewer is giving a general idea but not telling the authors exactly what to do. That seems a bit vague. I think this might be borderline actionable because it's not entirely clear, but it's not completely unactionable either. Maybe a 4?\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to a similar section and a specific paper. It doesn't explicitly name the part of the paper being discussed, but it's clear enough that the authors can infer which section it's talking about. So, I think this is fully grounded because the authors can pinpoint the referenced part, even if it's not explicitly stated. Maybe a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions a reference but doesn't explain why it's relevant or how it applies to the current work. It just cites the paper without much justification. That doesn't seem very verifiable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks key elements like examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for more detailed explanations and references, which is helpful. It guides the authors to think deeper about their work. However, it's not super detailed, so it's mostly helpful but could be improved. I'd give this a 4.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For actionability, since it's not entirely clear what needs to be done, maybe it's borderline. But the reviewer does suggest looking at a similar section, which is somewhat explicit. Maybe a 4 is still okay. Grounding is definitely 5 because the authors can figure out which part is being discussed. Verifiability is 3 because it's somewhat supported but lacks depth.

It doesn't specify what changes the authors should make. So, it's not explicit because it's more of an opinion rather than a direct instruction. It's also vague because it doesn't tell the authors how to adjust their metrics. So, this seems like it's somewhere between implicit and explicit, but more on the implicit side. Therefore, it's probably a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about metrics not being applicable in certain settings. It doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper or dataset. It's a bit vague about what exactly needs to be addressed. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't pin down the issue. Hence, a 3 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the metrics aren't suitable in some settings. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to back this claim. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it's unverifiable, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some insight into the limitations of the metrics but doesn't provide actionable steps or specific suggestions.

However, it doesn't explicitly tell the authors how to proceed or what specific changes they should make. It's more of an observation rather than a direct action. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable (3)** because it does suggest an issue but doesn't provide clear steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the statistical dimension d_lambda and mentions ridge regression. It's clear and specific about the parts of the paper it's addressing. It doesn't make vague claims about the paper's sections. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific (5)**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that knowing d_lambda is needed but doesn't provide evidence or references. It just states that computing it is as hard as solving ridge regression. There's no logical reasoning or external references to back this up. So, this is **Somewhat Verifiable (3)** because it has some justification but lacks key elements.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out potential issues with the approach but doesn't offer detailed suggestions or improvements. It's clear that the authors have identified a problem, but the review doesn't guide them on how to fix it. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful (3)** because it provides some insight but isn't comprehensive.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Let me just double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the error analysis is missing and suggests that other researchers need to know the failing cases. It's explicit about the issue but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They need to figure out what data to include. So, it's not fully actionable because the action isn't clearly stated. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the error analysis being missing but doesn't specify which part of the paper or dataset this refers to. It's a bit vague, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. This means it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the problem but doesn't clearly identify the specific section.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points out a problem (missing error analysis) but doesn't explain why it's a problem or provide any references or logical reasoning. It's just stating the issue without justification, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some mention of the problem but no solid evidence or explanation.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment identifies that the error analysis is missing, which is helpful, but it doesn't specify what to add or how to fix it. It's clear that the authors need more data but doesn't guide them on what kind of data or how to collect it. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it points out a clear issue but doesn't provide detailed guidance.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or specificity needed to be fully actionable, grounded, verifiable, or helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors mentioned limitations but should provide a detailed plan for future work. It explicitly states an action (provide a detailed plan) and explains how to do it (in their future work). That seems clear and direct, so I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but maybe a bit vague on the specifics of the plan.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"a detailed plan\" but doesn't specify where or how this plan should be detailed. It's not pointing to a specific part of the paper, so it's only **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it mentions the plan but doesn't pin it down to a section or figure.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about the authors needing a plan and suggesting where to look for it. There's no supporting evidence or references, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear about the need for a plan but doesn't give much detail on what that plan should include. It's helpful but not the most detailed, so I'll rate it **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It is expected that the amount of computation of FedMITR is higher than other methods. Have you compared this?\" The first thing I notice is that the reviewer is pointing out an expectation or assumption about FedMITR's computation requirements. They're asking if the author has compared this, which is a good start because it's a specific action (comparing FedMITR to other methods). However, the action isn't very explicit. The reviewer is implying that they expect FedMITR to be more computationally intensive, but they don't specify how or why this is a problem. So, it's not entirely clear what the author should do next. This makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because the action is implied but not clearly stated.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions FedMITR's computation but doesn't tie it directly to the paper. It's a general statement about FedMITR's expected computational demands. The reviewer doesn't specify which part of the paper this relates to or what exactly needs to be compared. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or issue. The comment is vague about how this affects the paper, so it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is asking the author to compare FedMITR with other methods. This is a claim because it's suggesting a comparison, which is an opinion or judgment. However, the justification is minimal. The reviewer is asking the author to do something, but they don't provide any supporting evidence or logical reasoning. It's just a request for comparison without backing it up. So, this is \"Unverifiable\" because there's no supporting evidence or justification given.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking the author to compare FedMITR with other methods, which is a suggestion but quite vague. It doesn't provide specific feedback or detailed advice on how to perform this comparison. Without more information, the author might not know exactly what steps to take. This makes the review somewhat helpful but not very detailed or actionable. So, it's a \"Somewhat Helpful\" score because it does provide a direction but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, justification, and detail provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

However, the writing is too confusing, and I cannot be sure if that is the case or not.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n**Actionability:**\n- The review points out that (1) and (2) can be avoided using an external knowledge base. This is an explicit action, so it's clear what the author should do. However, the second part about the writing being too confusing is vague. The author doesn't know exactly what needs to be fixed. So, while the first part is actionable, the second isn't, making the overall actionability somewhat low.\n\n**Grounding Specificity:**\n- The comment mentions \"a generic external knowledge base\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper is affected. It also refers to \"the writing\" generally, not pointing to a specific section or issue. Therefore, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the problematic part.\n\n**Verifiability:**\n- The first part suggests using an external knowledge base, which is a claim. It references Figure 3 but doesn't provide specific evidence or reasoning. The second part about writing being confusing is a statement without a claim or justification, so it's not verifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\n- The review offers a suggestion about using an external knowledge base but doesn't clearly address the confusing writing. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth and clarity, so it's a 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the definition on L259 is incorrect and that Eq1 is not perplexity but cross-entropy. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They know the definitions are wrong, but there's no clear instruction on how to fix them. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to apply the correction. I'd rate this as 1, which is unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific equations and terms like perplexity and cross-entropy, which are clearly pointed out in the paper. It doesn't just refer to a general part but specifically addresses Eq1. So, it's grounded because it accurately references the paper's elements. I think this is a 3, meaning it's somewhat grounded.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides clear explanations and distinguishes between perplexity and cross-entropy. It references Eq1, which is a specific external reference. This makes the claim verifiable because it's supported by the paper's content. So, I'd give it a 5, fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out specific errors and provides clear corrections. It helps the authors understand where they went wrong and what they should change. While it could be more detailed, it's still helpful. I'd rate this a 3, which is somewhat helpful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 5, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"the model has many components whose hyper parameters are not fully provided (someone may have to trace them in the source code).\" It mentions that hyperparameters aren't fully provided and suggests tracing them in the code. Now, for actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The comment does say that hyperparameters aren't provided, which is explicit. However, it doesn't tell the author exactly what to do. The suggestion is to trace them, which is a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the author isn't told how to fix it, just that they need to trace the code. So, I think this is borderline actionable. Maybe a 1 or 2. But according to the scale, 1 is unactionable, 2 is borderline. Since it's explicit about the problem but doesn't give a clear fix, I'll go with 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This looks at how specific the comment is about the paper. The review mentions hyperparameters not being fully provided. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this refers to. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 1, not grounded.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that hyperparameters aren't fully provided. It suggests tracing them in the code. Is this claim verifiable? Well, it's making a judgment that hyperparameters are missing, which is a claim. The suggestion to trace them in the code is some justification, but it's vague. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks support. Maybe a 3? Wait, no. The scale is 1 to 5. If it's a claim without sufficient justification, it's borderline. So, maybe 2. But I'm not sure. Let me think. The claim is that hyperparameters are missing, and the suggestion is to trace them. It's a claim, but the justification is minimal. So, maybe 2.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a problem with hyperparameters and suggests tracing them. It's clear and identifies an improvement area. However, it doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to fix it, just that the authors need to trace the code. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Therefore, a 3 seems appropriate.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, the user provided a score of 2 for helpfulness. Maybe I should reconsider. The comment does identify a problem and suggest a fix, which is helpful. But it's not very detailed. So, 2 makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores are: actionability 1, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability 2, helpfulness 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**:\nThe review points out that the authors' claim is incorrect and provides a counterexample. It suggests that the authors should revise their statement. This is explicit because it directly tells the authors what's wrong and what needs to be done. It's not vague; it clearly states the issue. So, this should be a higher score. I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while it's explicit, it doesn't give a specific method to fix the problem, just a general suggestion.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**:\nThe review mentions the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and provides a counterexample. It clearly references a specific statistical theorem, so the grounding is strong. It also explains what's wrong with the authors' claim, which adds specificity. Therefore, this should be a higher score. I think it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to the theorem and explains the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**:\nThe review claims that the authors' statement is incorrect and provides a counterexample. It explains why the claim is wrong using the CLT. This explanation is logical and provides sufficient justification. There's an external reference (CLT) and a clear reasoning process. So, this should be a higher score. I think it's **4: Mostly Verifiable** because while it's thorough, it could benefit from more examples or a clearer structure.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\nThe review is pointing out a specific mistake and providing a clear correction. It's helpful because it guides the authors on what to fix. However, it could be more helpful if it suggested specific edits or how to revise the statement. As it is, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. So, I think it's **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and actionable, though there's room for more detail.\n\nI should make sure each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided. Actionability was a bit tricky because it's explicit but doesn't give a method, so 3 makes sense. Grounding and Verifiability both received the highest scores because they were specific and well-supported. Helpfulness is also a high score because it's clear and actionable, though not the most detailed.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The proposed method may be less relevant to the authors' motivations in abstract section (automatic scores are not effective and human evaluation scores are not affordable). Since the proposed framework FFAEVAL and some similar framework like Chatbot Arena are used to do comparison between dialogue systems, I do not think it can be directly used to evaluate a single dialogue system, like give a fluency score or something like that. So these arena-based evaluation systems may not solve the problems of current score-based evaluation systems.\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the proposed method is less relevant to the authors' motivations in the abstract section because automatic scores aren't effective and human evaluation is too costly. It also talks about FFAEVAL and similar frameworks not being suitable for evaluating single dialogue systems. The reviewer is suggesting that these arena-based systems can't solve the problems of current score-based systems. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a limitation but isn't suggesting a specific action or improvement. They're making a judgment about the effectiveness of certain methods. So, it's not giving a clear direction on what to do next. Therefore, it's not very actionable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about automatic scores and human evaluation, which are general comments. They don't specify which part of the paper they're referring to, like the abstract or the methodology. So, the grounding isn't specific because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. It's more of a general critique. So, this would be a lower score, maybe 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that automatic scores aren't effective and that arena-based systems can't solve the problem. They're suggesting that current score-based systems have issues, but they don't provide evidence or references to back this up. It's a judgment without supporting data, so it's not very verifiable. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out the limitations of certain evaluation methods but isn't providing specific suggestions or solutions. They're making a critique but not offering actionable steps. So, while it's somewhat helpful in pointing out a problem, it's not very helpful overall. Maybe a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores would be around 1 for actionability, 3 for grounding, 3 for verifiability, and 3 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using RoBERTa-base instead of BERT. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it doesn't give concrete details on how to implement this change. So, it's explicit but lacks specifics. I think that makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but doesn't explain exactly how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about using a different model, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's just a general suggestion without pointing to a specific section or issue. So, it's not fully grounded. I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's vague about the part of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting a different model but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why RoBERTa-base is better. It's just a recommendation without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's not verifiable. I'll give this a **X: No Claim** because there's no claim or justification provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and relevant, which is good. However, it doesn't provide any specific reasoning or evidence for why RoBERTa-base is a better choice. It's helpful but lacks depth. So, I think it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it offers some guidance but isn't fully comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It would be good to show how to use the proposed method to achieve fair policy learning without 'severely damaging the performance of predictive model'.\" The key here is whether this is explicit or implicit. The reviewer is suggesting a method but isn't giving specific steps on how to implement it. It's vague about the exact actions the authors should take. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out the implementation details themselves. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable** since it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about \"showing how to use the proposed method\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be done. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. This means it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's specific in the suggestion but not in the grounding.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It's just stating that they should show how to use the method, but there's no backing for why that's necessary or how it's done. So, it's **X: No Claim** because there's no claim or justification provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is suggesting a method but not providing any specific guidance on how to implement it or why it's beneficial. It's vague and doesn't offer concrete steps, so it's somewhat helpful but not very. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify an area for improvement but lacks depth and clarity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The review says, \"There is a pervasive use of 'to meet' as in 'a response candidate can meet each utterance' on line 280 which is difficult to understand.\" The action here is pointing out the use of \"to meet\" as a problem. It's explicit because it directly names the issue. However, it doesn't give any specific advice on how to fix it. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear that there's a problem, but not how to address it. So, I think actionability is 2.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"a response candidate can meet each utterance\" on line 280. It's specific about the part of the paper, pointing to a particular line. However, it doesn't explain why this is a problem or how it affects the paper. It's only pointing out the issue without grounding it in the specific part's impact. So, it's grounded but not specific. That would be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the review states that the use of \"to meet\" is difficult to understand. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just an opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem but doesn't suggest any fixes or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors know what to do next. So, it's barely helpful, which is a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 2, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

It says the Perceptual Metric should connect the Second Inpainted Images with the Inpainted Image but not the Images Masked by Second Masks. The action is clear\u2014connecting specific images\u2014but the method isn't detailed. So, it's explicit about what needs to be done but lacks specifics on how to connect them. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** (label 3).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Figure 2 and mentions specific elements like the Second Inpainted Images and Images Masked by Second Masks. It's clear which parts of the figure are being addressed, so the grounding is strong. Also, it specifies what needs to be changed, which adds specificity. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific** (label 3).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any justification or evidence. It tells the authors what to do but doesn't explain why or how it's beneficial. There's no reference to external studies or common practices, so it's not verifiable. That makes it **Unverifiable** (label 1).\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues and suggests a change, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any rationale or evidence for why the change is necessary or beneficial. It's clear and actionable, but lacks depth, so it's **Somewhat Helpful** (label 3).\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is clear about what needs to be done but lacks details on how and why, so it's somewhat helpful and specific but not fully verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It suggests that Figure 1 should have one encoder-decoder per task. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, it directly states what needs to be changed. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It tells the authors exactly what to do: change Figure 1 to have one encoder-decoder per task. There's no ambiguity here. So it's both explicit and concrete. \n\nLooking at the scale, 5 is for highly actionable, which fits because it's clear and direct. So I think the actionability label should be 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figures 1 and 2 but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. It just says \"the paper\" in general. So the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or figure. It's more of a general statement. Therefore, grounding_specificity should be 1 because it's not grounded at all.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that Figure 1 is inconsistent with Figure 2. It's a claim, but there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It just states an observation without backing it up. So it's unverifiable. Hence, verifiability should be 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a discrepancy between two figures and suggests a change. It's clear and provides a specific improvement direction. However, it doesn't elaborate on why this change is necessary or how it benefits the paper. It's helpful but could be improved by adding more context or reasoning. So it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the labels would be actionability:5, grounding_specificity:1, verifiability:1, helpfulness:3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the main contribution is unclear and lists some issues like overstated abilities, unclear methods, and automation. It doesn't specify what the authors should do next. So, it's not explicit because it's more of a critique without clear steps. It's also vague because it doesn't tell the authors how to fix these issues. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does point out problems but doesn't give clear directions.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the main contribution being unclear and lists specific issues. It mentions the automation part but doesn't clearly identify which section or figure it's referring to. So, it's not fully grounded because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the problem is. It's somewhat grounded because it does touch on specific areas but isn't explicit about it.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes claims about the contribution being unclear and the properties not being well-supported. However, it doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back these claims. It's just stating opinions without justification, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify some issues but lacks clear suggestions on how to improve them. It's somewhat helpful because it points out problems, but it's not fully constructive. So, it's a **3: Somewhat Helpful** score.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated based on how well the review provides actionable feedback, grounds the issues in specific parts of the paper, supports claims with evidence, and helps the authors improve their work.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests alternatives to the current method, like using 30-40 models and unlabeled data. It also mentions that these methods could improve model stability. The comment is explicit about the actions the authors should take, like trying different models and unlabeled data. Additionally, it provides clear guidance on how to implement these changes, such as setting a churn rate and using target data. So, this seems highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do and how to apply the suggestions.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific methods (30-40 models, unlabeled data) and their potential benefits. It's clear which parts of the paper or methods are being discussed, so the grounding is strong. The comment doesn't just mention vague ideas but specifically refers to the number of models and data types, which helps the authors pinpoint where to focus their improvements. Therefore, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that using these methods will improve model stability. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support this claim. The justification is vague because it doesn't explain why more models or unlabeled data would help, or cite any studies. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary details, making it a 3 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions and alternatives, which is helpful. However, it doesn't delve into the reasoning behind these choices or provide examples of how these methods have worked in similar contexts. While it's mostly helpful, it could be improved by adding more justification or examples, which is why it's a 4.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, the review is highly actionable, fully grounded and specific, somewhat verifiable, and mostly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the experiments are not sufficient and mentions specific issues like limited teacher architectures and most methods being before 2019. It also references a table. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer points out problems but doesn't specify how to fix them. They mention types of architectures but don't suggest replacements or alternatives. Similarly, mentioning past methods doesn't provide guidance on what to do next. So, it's not explicit enough. It's more of a diagnosis without actionable steps. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The reviewer talks about experiments, types of architectures, and methods from before 2019, referencing a table. They do mention specific elements like \"types of teacher architectures\" and \"methods proposed before 2019,\" which shows they're pointing to specific parts. However, the comment is a bit vague in explaining what needs to be done. They don't tell the authors exactly what changes to make, just that there are issues. So, while they're grounded in mentioning specific sections, they don't clearly specify what needs fixing. I think this falls under weak grounding and not specific, so a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the experiments are insufficient and lists reasons. They also reference a table, which adds credibility. However, the explanation is a bit vague. They mention types of architectures but don't provide examples or references. The reference to the table is good, but without more details, it's not fully verifiable. So, I'd rate this as 1 because the justification isn't robust enough.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out problems and provides some context with references. However, it doesn't suggest specific fixes or improvements. It's more of a critique without actionable advice. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. I'd rate this a 2 because it's better than nothing but not fully helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, justification, and action guidance provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions specific comparisons and provides examples, like H->N and H->B using less data. It also gives concrete advice on how to improve the comparisons. So, this seems highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to do. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific issues in Table 2 by mentioning the comparisons and examples. It clearly identifies the problematic parts, so this is fully grounded. The specificity is high because it explains exactly what's wrong. So, this is also a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review offers clear reasoning and examples to support its claims. It explains why the comparisons are an issue and provides specific instances where less data is used. This makes the verifiability solid, so I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly verifiable but maybe a bit lacking in depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides specific suggestions. It helps the authors understand where the issues are and how to fix them. While it could be more detailed, it's still quite helpful. So, a 4 seems appropriate here.\n\nOverall, the review is strong in actionability, grounding, and helpfulness, but slightly less so in verifiability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that prior knowledge isn't always available and might be inaccurate, which is a valid point. But it doesn't specify what the authors should do next. They don't provide any actionable steps or solutions. So, it's not explicit because it's more of an observation than a clear instruction. It's also vague because it doesn't give any concrete advice. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it hints at a problem but doesn't tell them how to fix it. So, I'll give it a 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about prior knowledge not being available or accurate, but it doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper. It's a general concern without pinning down where exactly the issue is. So, the grounding is weak because it's not specific enough. However, it does mention what's wrong, which is specificity. So, I'll rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that prior knowledge isn't always available and might be inaccurate. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it's not fully verifiable because there's no supporting data. I'll give it a 3 here as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a practical concern but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions. It's more of a critique than a helpful comment. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nOverall, the review is somewhat helpful but could improve by being more specific and providing actionable steps.\n</think>\n\n**Evaluation of Review Point:**\n\n- **Actionability Label:** 2  \n  The review acknowledges a problem but doesn't provide explicit or actionable steps for the authors.\n\n- **Grounding Specificity Label:** 3  \n  The review identifies a concern but doesn't clearly specify the part of the paper being addressed.\n\n- **Verifiability Label:** 3  \n  The review states an opinion without supporting evidence, making it unverifiable.\n\n- **Helpfulness Label:** 3  \n  The review provides a relevant critique but lacks actionable suggestions or evidence.\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests improvements but doesn't specify how to implement them. It's explicit about the actions but lacks detail on how to fix each problem.

It's a bit vague in terms of pinpointing exactly where the problems are. So, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes claims about the lack of polishing and the issues with the experiments.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The discussion around equation (10) is very terse, and not very clearly explained.\" The key here is whether this is actionable. It mentions that the discussion is terse and unclear, which is a negative point. But does it tell the author exactly what to do? It suggests that the discussion needs to be improved but doesn't specify how. So, it's not explicit because it's more of a general statement. It's also vague because it doesn't provide concrete steps. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does imply an action but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to equation (10) but doesn't specify which part of the discussion is problematic. It just says it's terse and unclear. Since it doesn't point to a specific section or detail, the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it can't be precisely identified.
