Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors didn't consider the 'and' operator or element-wise max, which correspond to union and intersection. It also asks why the chosen options were better. The reviewer is pointing out a specific action the authors should take, which is to consider these alternatives. However, the comment is more of a question rather than a direct instruction. It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do, just what to consider. So, it's not fully explicit. Since it's a question, it's a bit vague on how to apply the suggested alternatives. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear (consider alternatives), but the implementation isn't detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer refers to specific operations (union and intersection) by mentioning the 'and' operator and element-wise max. They also ask why the chosen options were better, which implies a deeper understanding of the paper's context. This shows that the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the part of the paper being discussed, so the grounding is full. Additionally, the specificity is high because the reviewer is not just stating a general issue but is asking for a comparison of specific methods. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is asking a question without providing any supporting evidence or justification. They're suggesting alternatives but not explaining why these are better or citing any references. This means the claim (if any) isn't well-supported, so it's \"Unverifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out specific areas for improvement and asking a clear question, which should help the authors. However, the suggestion is somewhat vague because it's a comparison without details. The authors might need more guidance on why these alternatives are better or how to implement them. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests revising the description to mention Li et al. (2019a) earlier. This is an explicit action, so it's clear what needs to be done. The comment also provides concrete details about the dataset being a subset, which helps the authors understand exactly how to revise their text. Therefore, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific sources and details the exact nature of the data used. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed and explains what's missing. This strong grounding makes it easy for the authors to pinpoint the issue. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests citing a specific source. While this provides some justification, it's not entirely clear how this supports the claim. The authors might need more explanation on why citing this source is necessary or how it directly addresses the issue. Therefore, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a clear suggestion to include a specific citation, which is directly helpful. It guides the authors on what to do without being vague. While it could be more detailed, it's still highly helpful as it provides actionable feedback.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, each aspect is scored based on how well the review point fulfills the criteria for that aspect.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"both tasks\": antecedent missing. It mentions checking references for format, like Grice, Sorower et al, and the verbnet reference. So, the action here is checking the references, which is explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It says to check for capitalization and bibliographic details, which is pretty clear. So, this is explicit and concrete. Therefore, it should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about references but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. It just says to check the format. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly point to a specific section or figure. It's more of a general instruction. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific, which would be a 3.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment suggests checking references but doesn't provide any justification or reasoning why this is necessary or helpful. It just gives a task without backing it up. So, there's no verifiable evidence provided, making it unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review tells the authors to check their references but doesn't offer any specific advice on what to do or why it's important. It's vague and lacks depth. While it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive or impactful. So, it's a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions comparing to Campos et al. (2020) and other domain adaptation methods but doesn't specify how to do that. It just says \"should compare\" without details. Then, it points out a specific line that needs fixing. So, it's explicit about the action but vague on the implementation. That seems like it's on the higher end of actionable but not fully concrete. I'd say 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review does mention specific sections and other methods, which is good. It's clear which parts are being addressed, so that's fully grounded. It also explains what needs to be fixed, which is specific. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claim is that the baseline models are weak and should be compared. The support includes citing another paper and mentioning domain adaptation. However, the explanation is a bit vague about how to perform the comparisons. It lacks specific references or detailed reasoning, so it's somewhat verifiable. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out weaknesses and suggest improvements, which is helpful. It's clear and provides actionable points, though it could be expanded. So, it's mostly helpful, which I'll rate as 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a figure and clarifying the input type. It also mentions that the authors will correct the figure in their response. This seems like a clear action, so it's explicit. The instructions are specific about what to add and how to implement it. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific sections (section 2.3) and mentions the Lample et al. model, which helps ground the feedback. It also refers to Figure 3 and the source language, which are specific parts of the paper. The mention of adding a figure and clarifying input type is clear and specific. So, this should be fully grounded and specific. I'll also give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests adding a figure and clarifying the input type. It references Lample et al., which is a well-known source, so that's a good external reference. The reasoning is clear, and the references are specific. However, it doesn't provide a lot of detailed justification beyond the references. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'll rate it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting improvements and provides specific actions like adding a figure. It also mentions that the authors will correct the figure, which shows a proactive approach. While it's specific, it could be more detailed, but overall, it's helpful. I'll give it a 4.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, each aspect is evaluated based on the criteria provided, and I've assigned scores accordingly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out two specific issues, which is good. It tells the authors exactly what needs to be improved. The first point is about the pooling method, and the second is about equation (7). Both are clear and direct, so the authors know exactly where to focus. The instructions mention that explicit actions are better, and this fits because they're not just asking for improvements but specifying exactly what to do. There's no ambiguity here, so I think this is highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific sections, line 397 and equation (7). It doesn't just say \"improve presentation\" but points to exact places. This means the authors can pinpoint exactly where the changes are needed. It's not vague or too general. So, this is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the parts of the paper being discussed. I'll also give this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests improvements but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just recommends changes and asks for clarification. Without any justification or examples, it's hard to verify if these changes are based on solid reasoning or just suggestions. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it does suggest improvements, but lacks the backing needed to be fully verifiable. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear and specific about what needs to be done. It doesn't just say \"make changes\" but actually asks for details like defining variables in equation (7). This makes it very helpful because it guides the authors in making precise improvements. It's thorough and actionable, so I'll rate this a 5.\n\nOverall, the review is effective in guiding the authors with specific, clear, and detailed feedback, making it highly helpful and grounded. It's also explicit and actionable, though it lacks supporting evidence, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper has many empirical results and analyses but asks the authors to clarify what the experiments tell about the research question. It's a good start because it gives a specific action\u2014asking for clarification. However, the comment is more of a question rather than a direct instruction. It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do, like suggesting specific changes or how to improve their analysis. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does suggest an action but doesn't provide detailed guidance. So, the actionability label should be 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out that the authors need to better connect their results to the research question. It doesn't explicitly name a specific part of the paper, like a section or figure, so the grounding is weak. However, it does clearly identify the issue, which is about linking results to the hypothesis. So, it's not fully grounded but does address the specific problem. Therefore, grounding_specificity should be 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about the authors' analysis being difficult to follow. It's a claim that the experiments don't clearly connect to the research question. But there's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's vague and lacks justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Hence, verifiability is 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question to help the authors clarify their results but doesn't provide specific suggestions or examples. It's helpful in that it identifies an issue, but it's not very detailed or actionable. So, it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated 3 because they either provide a suggestion without full detail or don't offer strong evidence to back up the claims made.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding experiments with wider backbones, which is a clear action. But it doesn't specify how to implement this, like whether they should use the same training setup or if they need to adjust hyperparameters. So, it's explicit but lacks detail. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific methods (MoCo, SimCLR) and specific wider backbones (ResNet50x2 and ResNet50x4). It clearly identifies the parts of the paper that need improvement, so it's fully grounded. Also, it specifies what needs to be addressed, making it **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests an improvement but doesn't provide evidence or reasoning why wider backbones would help. It's vague, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and actionable, pointing out a specific area for improvement. It helps the authors know what to work on but doesn't offer more details. So, it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the probabilistic connection isn't drawn well and suggests formalizing it or adjusting the language. The action here is suggesting formalization or clearer language, which is explicit. But the review doesn't tell the authors exactly how to do that. It's vague about whether they should use equations or just improve the wording. So, it's not fully actionable because the method isn't specified. That would make it **4: Mostly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the probabilistic connection but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague about where to focus. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the section. The specificity about what needs fixing is also lacking. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting improvements but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to back it up. It's just a suggestion without justification. So, it's not verifiable. That would be **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some suggestion but lacks support.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a suggestion to improve the probabilistic connection, which is clear and actionable. Even though it's vague on how to do it, it's still helpful because it guides the authors in a specific direction. So, it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is clear in its suggestion but lacks specifics in some areas, making it somewhat actionable and helpful but not fully in those aspects.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this peer review comment based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The comment says, \"2: the callout to table 5 should go to table 3, instead. Page 7, section 5, last par.: figure 6 callout is not directing properly.\" \n\nFirst, I check if the action is explicit. The reviewer is telling the authors exactly where the callouts should go, so that's explicit. Now, is the action concrete? The reviewer isn't just saying something needs to be fixed; they're specifying which tables and where. So, it's concrete. But wait, the comment is a bit vague about why the callouts should go there. It doesn't explain the reasoning behind moving table 5's callout to table 3. It just says \"should go instead.\" That makes it a bit implicit in terms of the reasoning. So, it's explicit in the action but vague in the reasoning. According to the scale, that would be **2: Borderline Actionable** because the action is clear, but the reasoning is vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions specific tables (5 and 3) and a specific part of the page (section 5, last paragraph) and a figure (6). It's clearly pointing to specific sections, so grounding is strong. The specificity is also good because it's not just saying \"the figure needs improvement\" but pointing to figure 6. So, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because while it's grounded, it's also specific, which is even better. Wait, looking back at the definitions, fully grounded and specific is 5, but weakly grounded and specific is 3. Since it's clearly pointing to specific parts, maybe it's fully grounded. Hmm, maybe I was too hasty. Let me check. The comment does mention specific sections and figures, so it's fully grounded. But the specificity is about how detailed the comment is about what needs fixing. It's specific about which figure's callout is off, so that's specific. So, it should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment doesn't contain any claims or opinions; it's just stating what needs to be done. There's no justification or reasoning provided. So, it's a normal statement, which means it's **X: No Claim**. Therefore, verifiability is low.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does point out specific issues with the callouts, which is helpful. However, it doesn't explain why the changes are necessary or provide any reasoning. It's pointing out the problem but not guiding the authors on how to fix it. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. That would be a **3: Somewhat Helpful** score.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For actionability, I thought it was borderline because the reasoning was vague. For grounding, it's fully grounded and specific. Verifiability is no claim. Helpfulness is somewhat helpful. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} 1. **Actionability Label**: The review point is labeled as \"1: Unactionable\". This is because the comment mentions the concern about experiments but does not explicitly state what needs to be done. It suggests adding comparisons with SketchRNN but does not provide clear instructions on how to implement this change. The vagueness makes it difficult for the authors to know exactly what steps to take, hence it's considered unactionable.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**: The label is \"3: Weakly Grounded and Specific\". The review points out the issue with experiments but does not explicitly name the part of the paper being addressed. However, it does specify that the paper should explain why self comparisons are lacking and suggest adding comparisons with SketchRNN, which adds some specificity to the feedback.\n\n3. **Verifiability Label**: The label is \"3: Somewhat Verifiable\". The review mentions the need for motivation and suggests adding comparisons with SketchRNN. While it provides some justification for the suggestion, it lacks explicit references to external literature or logical reasoning to fully support the claim. Therefore, it is somewhat verifiable but not fully supported.\n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**: The label is \"3: Somewhat Helpful\". The review raises valid concerns about the experiments and provides suggestions for improvement. However, the suggestions are vague and lack specific details or references, making it somewhat helpful but not entirely comprehensive. The authors would gain some insights but might need further clarification or more detailed guidance to fully address the concerns.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests more analysis on the performance trends of increasing model capacity in ViT, specifically mentioning Figure 3. It also disagrees with the authors' viewpoint about CNNs and ViTs benefiting similarly. The reviewer points out that DeiT-B models don't outperform DeiT-S and DeiT-T in certain datasets, and that 0.1% improvement isn't significant. They also note that CNNs show more consistent improvements except on ISIC2019.\n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is making specific recommendations about what analysis to perform (more analysis on Figure 3) and pointing out discrepancies in the authors' claims. However, the suggestions are a bit vague. They don't specify exactly what kind of analysis to conduct or how to interpret the results. So, while the reviewer is directing the authors towards something, it's not entirely clear what exactly they should do next. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit.\n\nMoving on to **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions Figure 3 and specific datasets like APTOS2019, ISIC2019, and CheXpert. They also refer to the 0.1% improvement not being significant. This shows that the reviewer can identify the specific parts of the paper being discussed, which is full grounding. Additionally, they are pointing out specific issues within those parts, which adds to the specificity. So, this seems to be both grounded and specific.\n\nNext, **verifiability**: The reviewer is making a claim that DeiT-B models don't outperform DeiT-S and DeiT-T in certain datasets, and that 0.1% improvement isn't significant. They also suggest that CNNs show more consistent improvements. To support these claims, they reference specific datasets and mention the significance level. However, the reasoning is a bit vague. They don't provide detailed explanations or logical reasoning for why 0.1% isn't significant or how the model capacities differ between CNNs and ViTs. There's some reference to external knowledge (like model capacity effects), but it's not explicitly cited. So, while the claim is somewhat supported, there's room for more justification and references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is clearly pointing out discrepancies in the authors' claims and suggesting specific analyses. This provides the authors with clear feedback and direction. However, the suggestions are somewhat vague, and the reviewer doesn't elaborate on what kind of analysis to perform or how to interpret the results. While it's helpful, it could be more detailed to be even more helpful. Overall, it's somewhat helpful but not entirely comprehensive.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts:\n\n- **Actionability**: Somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. So, a 3.\n- **Grounding Specificity**: Fully grounded and specific. So, a 5.\n- **Verifiability**: Somewhat verifiable but with gaps. So, a 3.\n- **Helpfulness**: Somewhat helpful but could be more detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says the paper is not difficult to follow but mentions several places that might cause confusion. I think this is explicit because it directly points out areas that need improvement. However, it doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done, like suggesting a particular fix or how to make it clearer. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know what steps to take. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"several places that might cause confusion\" but doesn't specify which sections or what exactly is confusing. It's vague about the specific parts of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the exact issues. Therefore, it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the paper isn't difficult but doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just an opinion without justification.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the results are mostly based on standard techniques but require a fair degree of technical competency. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They might know they need to improve their techniques but aren't given clear steps. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which makes it borderline actionable because it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about standard techniques but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue lies, so it's not grounded. It's weakly grounded because it mentions something about techniques, but it's not specific enough.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification. It just states that the techniques are standard but require technical expertise. There's no claim here, so it's not verifiable. It falls under the \"X\" category because there's no claim to verify.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does point out a problem, which is that the results rely on standard techniques but need more expertise. However, it's vague and doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth, so it's a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 1 except helpfulness, which is a 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking the authors to clarify how their bilinear layer differs from others. It's a good question, but it's pretty open-ended. The authors might not know exactly what to do next. It mentions specific methods like Hadarmard product and MCB, but doesn't provide clear steps on how to implement these. So, it's explicit in asking for clarification but lacks specific instructions. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but the details are vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points to specific methods and equations, which means it's clearly addressing a particular part of the paper. It's not just a general critique but specifically references technical aspects. So, the grounding is strong. It also explains what needs to be done, which adds specificity. Therefore, it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim by asking questions about the implementation details. However, it's not providing any supporting evidence or references. The questions are good for prompting further investigation but don't back them up with facts or sources. So, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification or examples given.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for clarification on specific technical points, which is helpful. It guides the authors to think about their implementation but doesn't offer concrete solutions or additional information. It's somewhat helpful because it does prompt them to improve their work, but it's not as detailed as it could be. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable and grounded, but it's not very verifiable and only somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says, \"Why not directly illustrate the results of the latter loss term of Eqn 13?\" It's asking the author to change how they present results, but it's pretty vague. The author might not know exactly how to \"directly illustrate\" the loss term. So, it's not giving a clear action, which makes it borderline actionable. I think it's a 3 because it's somewhat explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to \"the latter loss term of Eqn 13\" which is specific. The author knows exactly which part to change. So, it's fully grounded because it points to a specific equation. The specificity is good because it tells the author exactly what to do. I'll give it a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim suggesting a better way to illustrate results. It doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just says, \"Why not directly illustrate...\" without explaining why or how. So, it's unverifiable. I'll mark it as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment is asking for a change but doesn't explain why or how it's beneficial. It's vague and doesn't help the author understand the improvement. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'll rate it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The comment is pointing out that there's an implicit call to the Witness oracle, which is confusing. But does it give a clear action? It says the call is confusing, but it doesn't tell the authors what to do next. They might need to look into what the Witness oracle is or how it's used. So, it's not explicit; it's more of an implicit statement. Therefore, it's not fully actionable because the authors still have to figure out what to do. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment mentions the Witness oracle but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's unclear whether it's in the methodology, results, or somewhere else. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Hence, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is stating a problem (the call is confusing) but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just an opinion or judgment without supporting references or logical reasoning. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to support the claim. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out an issue but doesn't provide any suggestions or guidance on how to fix it. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve their work beyond identifying the problem. So, it's not helpful at all. Therefore, helpfulness is 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors should clarify the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training. It also provides specific examples, like renaming a column in Table 1 and suggesting two new columns. This seems pretty explicit, so it's not implicit. The actions are clear: renaming the column and creating two new ones. Plus, it tells the authors exactly how to do this. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like Table 1 and suggests adding new columns. It doesn't just say \"improve the paper\"; it points to exact sections. So, the grounding is strong because it clearly references the paper's content. The specificity is also high because it tells the authors exactly what needs to be done. I'll also give this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the authors should rename the column and add new ones. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just a suggestion without justification. So, it's not fully verifiable. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary support.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides specific suggestions. It helps the authors by guiding them on exactly what changes to make. While it doesn't go into depth on why these changes are necessary, it's still very helpful. I'll rate this a 5 because it's highly helpful, even if it's not the most comprehensive.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, each aspect gets a 5 except verifiability, which I think is a 3 because it lacks supporting evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions NCNet and Sparse NCNet, but it doesn't specify what changes the author should make. It just says \"small contributions\" and that it's hard to differentiate from predecessors. There's no clear action or suggestion, so it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about NCNet and Sparse NCNet but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. This means it's not grounded. I'll give it a 1 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just states that the method is hard to differentiate from predecessors. Without justification or references, it's not verifiable. So, a 1 here as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment mentions contributions but doesn't specify how to improve or provide evidence.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the methodology is questionable, specifically about considering a single vulnerability at a time. It suggests that previous work considers multiple vulnerabilities and whether the code contains any. The reviewer is pointing out that the authors are addressing a data imbalance issue but isn't clear on the ecological validity. They also ask if the authors are arguing that one vulnerability at a time is an intended use case. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is making specific points about what the authors should do, like comparing their approach to previous work. They're also asking clarifying questions, which makes it explicit. However, the advice about ecological validity is somewhat vague. The reviewer doesn't provide a clear step-by-step on how to implement this, just mentions it. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer refers to \"previous work\" and \"whether the code contains any such vulnerability.\" They also ask if the authors are making a specific argument about their approach. This shows that the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the section of the paper being discussed, which is full grounding. Additionally, the reviewer is clearly specifying what needs to be addressed, which adds to the specificity. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is pointing out that the authors' approach is different from previous work but doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning. They're relying on the authors' own previous work but don't explain why this is a valid approach or how it applies to their study. This seems like it's somewhat justified but lacks key elements, so it's \"Somewhat Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides specific points about the methodology, previous work, and the intended use case. They also ask clarifying questions, which is helpful. However, the feedback is a bit vague and doesn't go into depth about how to interpret the results or what specific improvements the authors should make. It's clear and actionable enough, but not the most detailed. So, this should be \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nWait, but the initial evaluation said actionability was 3, grounding 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4. Let me double-check. Actionability was somewhat actionable because it's explicit but lacks detail. Grounding was fully grounded and specific. Verifiability was somewhat because it's justified but lacks key elements. Helpfulness was somewhat helpful because it's clear but not the most detailed. So, the initial assessment seems correct.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the originality is limited because the main idea of variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new either. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. So, it's just pointing out that something isn't new but doesn't suggest any changes or improvements. That means it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to fix it or what to add. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions that variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to or provide any details about what's wrong. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issues are because the comment doesn't give enough information. So, grounding_specificity is also 1 because it's not grounded in the paper's specific parts.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. But it doesn't provide any evidence or references to support this claim. It's just a statement without justification. Therefore, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to make it reliable. So, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that the main idea isn't new and the algorithm isn't new, but it doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's just pointing out a lack of originality without providing actionable steps. Since the authors don't know what to do next, the review isn't helpful. So, helpfulness is 1.\n\nOverall, the review is lacking in all four aspects because it doesn't provide clear actions, specific references, verifiable claims, or helpful suggestions to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that an ablation study is missing and suggests improvements, but it's quite vague. It doesn't specify exactly what changes should be made or how to implement them. So, it's not explicit enough. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does suggest an action but doesn't give clear details. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out the missing ablation study and specific parameters like \u03b7 and \u03c4 in equation (7) that aren't analyzed. However, it doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper these issues pertain to. It's making educated guesses about where the problems are without being precise. So, this is \"Weakly Grounded and Specific.\" I'll rate it a 3 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the ablation study is missing and suggests improvements, but it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just stating opinions without backing them up. So, this is \"Unverifiable.\" I'll assign a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out some issues and provides a few suggestions, but it's quite vague. It doesn't offer concrete guidance on how to fix the problems or provide data to support the claims. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very.

It doesn't provide specific steps on how to improve the model, so it's explicit but lacks detail. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the review points out a specific part of the paper (section 2) and clearly explains why it's an issue. It doesn't just say \"this is bad,\" but connects it to the model's limitations. So that's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nLooking at **verifiability**, the claim is supported by logical reasoning about the model's limitations. It references the per-data-instance basis but doesn't cite external sources, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides a meaningful critique, helping the authors understand the model's shortcomings.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests looking into generalizing results to other models and includes an example for GPT-2. It's explicit about the action, which is good. But it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to generalize or what specific analyses to include. However, it does give a clear direction, so I think it's actionable. Maybe a 4 or 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific models like GPT-2 and suggests including Figure 2. That's pretty specific. It doesn't just say \"look into other models\" but names them and provides an example. So this should be fully grounded and specific. Maybe a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the results should be generalized, but it doesn't provide any evidence or references. It's just stating an opinion without justification. So it's not verifiable. Maybe a 2 or 3. Since it's a claim without support, I'll go with 2.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out a limitation and giving an example. It helps the authors know what to improve and how. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. So a 4 seems right.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, if the claim is not supported, maybe it's 2.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the abstract explains the idea well but doesn't describe how it was evaluated or the outcome. It also points out minor language issues. For actionability, I'm looking for explicit and concrete actions. The comment does say the abstract lacks evaluation details, which is explicit, but it doesn't tell the author how to improve the abstract. It's vague on the specific changes needed, so it's not fully actionable. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does mention an action but doesn't provide enough detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the abstract but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It doesn't mention the evaluation process or the outcome, so the author can't pinpoint where to make changes. This means the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the specific section or issue. So, I'd give this a **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** since it's not clearly pointing out the exact part of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the abstract lacks evaluation details but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. It's just a statement without supporting references or logical reasoning. Therefore, it's not verifiable, so I'll rate this as **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out areas for improvement, like the abstract and minor language issues.

However, it doesn't specify how this affects the problem setting or if the source domains use unlabeled data during training. The comment is explicit about pointing out the confusion but doesn't provide clear guidance on how to address it.

It clearly identifies the issue without making broad or vague comments. The grounding is strong because it accurately points to the sections and external references without needing further clarification.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe comment contains a claim that the problem setting is confusing and refers to the original paper. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for why this is an issue or how it affects the method. The reasoning is vague, so it's not well-supported by facts or references, making it somewhat verifiable but lacking depth.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review is clear and points out specific issues in the paper. It suggests that the authors should refer to the original MFDA paper for clarification, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the authors need to make a clear distinction between three classes of extreme speech. It points out that while definitions are included, differentiating between derogatory and exclusionary speech is challenging. It also asks about the specific regulation used in the annotation, which is a good action. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this, like providing examples or steps. So, it's explicit in wanting an action but vague on how to do it. That makes it **4: Mostly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the need to differentiate between two types of extreme speech but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper or data this refers to. It talks about a sample data file and local regulations but doesn't clearly point to the sections or tables. So, the grounding is weak because it's not precise. It's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review does suggest a claim by pointing out the need for clarification on the regulation. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just asks a question, which is a claim without justification. So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but it's lacking.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out a specific issue and asking for clarification. It provides a clear suggestion, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer detailed guidance or examples, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.

It then suggests that under different time-step scenarios, the proposed method might make more sense. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, it does suggest a scenario where the method could be better, but it's a bit vague. The authors aren't told exactly what to do; they're just told that under different conditions, the method might be more effective. So, it's not explicit because it's an inference rather than a direct instruction. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. It's more of a hint, so I'd rate it as 2 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 5 and mentions different time-step scenarios. It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper Figure 5 refers to or what specific issue it highlights. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the problem lies. It's not fully grounded since it's not clearly specifying the issue. Hence, grounding_specificity is 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the effectiveness is questionable under certain conditions. It suggests looking into different time-steps but doesn't provide evidence or references to back this up. The justification is vague, so it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary support. Therefore, verifiability is 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some insight but in a vague way. It points out a potential limitation and suggests an area for improvement without giving concrete steps. While it's somewhat helpful, it doesn't fully guide the authors on what changes to make. So, it's rated as 3 for helpfulness.\n\nOverall, the review provides some useful feedback but lacks explicitness and support, making it moderately helpful and grounding.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that disentanglement isn't clearly guaranteed and points out a limitation in the \"Broader Impacts and Limitations\" section. It suggests highlighting how disentanglement is achieved without certain biases. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a specific action. They're suggesting where to look but not detailing how to fix it. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the limitations section but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper or what aspect of disentanglement is lacking. It's a bit vague. The grounding here is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or issue. So, this would be **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that disentanglement isn't guaranteed and suggests looking into the limitations. However, they don't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's a claim without justification, so it's not verifiable. This falls under **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify a problem and provides a suggestion, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is quite vague and doesn't give detailed guidance on how to address the issue. It's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, justification, and overall guidance provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions specific state-of-the-art works and provides some details about their experiments. It suggests adding these references and mentions the VRF achieving a high accuracy. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement these changes or what modifications are needed. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but lacks concrete details on how to fix it. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review clearly references specific works and provides details about their experiments. It doesn't just say \"some references are missing\" but gives exact examples and mentions the dataset sizes and results. This means the authors can pinpoint where to look and what might be missing. So, this is fully grounded because it accurately identifies the sections being discussed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the missing references could be relevant. It supports this by citing a specific work and providing some details about their experiments. However, the support is a bit vague\u2014like mentioning the dataset size and accuracy but not explaining why these specifics are important or how they relate to the current paper's findings. It's somewhat verifiable but not entirely robust.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest adding references and points out specific works, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into how these additions would improve the paper or what exactly is missing. It's clear and provides direction, so it's highly helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is scored based on how well the review meets the criteria for each. Actionability is somewhat actionable, grounding is fully grounded, verifiability is somewhat verifiable, and helpfulness is highly helpful but could be improved with more specifics.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that ICL-HAR improves consistency and verifiability but hinders accuracy scores. It suggests discussing or acknowledging this in the main text. The action here is clear: the authors should address this issue. However, the comment doesn't specify how to do this, like suggesting alternative methods or providing data. So, it's explicit but lacks detail. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear but not detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to ICL-HAR by name, which is a specific part of the paper. It mentions accuracy scores dropping, which is a specific issue. The grounding is strong because it clearly points to a specific part and a specific problem. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment states that ICL-HAR has \"greatly impedes\" accuracy scores. It mentions dropping from 70.4 to 55.6. This is a claim because it's making a judgment about the impact of ICL-HAR. The justification is vague\u2014it doesn't explain why this happens or suggest solutions. There's no reference to external studies or logical reasoning. So, this is \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because it has some justification but lacks key elements like examples or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides information about the impact of ICL-HAR but doesn't offer actionable suggestions. It tells the authors what's wrong but doesn't guide them on how to fix it. This is somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, it should be \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the provided review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"there is a drop of correlation after a short period of training, which goes up with more training iterations.\" It mentions a drop in correlation but doesn't specify what needs to be done. So, the action isn't explicit. It's more of a statement than a suggestion. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to fix. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about a drop in correlation without pointing to a specific part of the paper. It doesn't mention any sections, tables, or figures. So, the grounding is weak because it can't accurately identify where the issue is. Hence, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review makes a claim about the correlation dropping with short training but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That gives it a 1 in verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a trend but doesn't offer any actionable steps or explanations. It's vague and lacks guidance, so it's not helpful at all. Therefore, helpfulness is 1.\n\nSo, all four aspects are rated as 1 because the review lacks explicit actions, grounding, verifiability, and helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the derivation from Eqn. 3 to Eqn. 4 misses the temperature \u03c4 and suggests showing it rigorously or mentioning it in the paper. The action here is clear: the authors need to include \u03c4 in their derivation. It's explicit because it directly tells them what to do. But the issue is that it doesn't specify exactly how to include \u03c4. They might need to adjust the equations or provide more context. So, it's not fully actionable because the method isn't detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Eqn. 3 and 4 but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. The authors have to figure out where the equations are located. It's not fully grounded because it's an educated guess rather than a direct reference. So, this should be a \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the derivation is missing \u03c4. It suggests adding it, which is a claim. However, the justification is vague. It just says \"show it rigorously\" without providing examples or references. There's no logical reasoning or external sources backing this up. So, it's only somewhat verifiable, which is a 3. Wait, no, the initial assessment said 1. Hmm, maybe I was too hasty. Let me think again. The claim is that \u03c4 should be included, but there's no evidence or examples given. So, it's not well-supported. Maybe it's unverifiable, so 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a specific issue with the equations and suggests an improvement. It's clear and directly addresses a problem. The authors can understand what needs to be done. It's somewhat helpful because it's specific enough but doesn't go into too much detail. So, a 3 makes sense here.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, I initially thought 1 because there's no justification. But maybe if it's a claim, it's better to have at least some reasoning. Maybe it's 3 after all. I'm a bit confused, but I'll stick with the initial assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the work is only a \"very first step\" towards strategic settings and points out that the opponent doesn't behave strategically. It doesn't specify what changes are needed or how to improve. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit comment, which makes it borderline actionable. I think a 2 here because it's not fully actionable but has some implicit suggestions.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about \"strategic predictions\" and the opponent not behaving strategically. It doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper or provide examples. So, it's only partially grounded. I'd rate this a 3 because it's not fully grounded but does address a specific area.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the opponent doesn't behave strategically. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this claim. It's just an opinion without justification, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a limitation but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'd give it a 3 here.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own score based on how well the review point meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests running experiments with untrained networks and adding them to the figures and table. It also asks to clarify some points about random data. The instructions are pretty explicit, so the authors can directly follow them. The action is clear, and the details provided are concrete, like adding experiments and normalizing data. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific figures (3c and 3) and asks about the data used. It's clear which parts of the paper are being referred to, so the grounding is strong. The comment also provides specific instructions, which makes it well-grounded. Therefore, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides clear instructions and logical reasoning. It explains what needs to be done without relying on external references. The justification is solid, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is very specific and actionable. It guides the authors through clear steps and clarifies ambiguities in the paper. While it could be expanded a bit, it's already quite helpful. So it's mostly helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores highly except verifiability, which is also good but not perfect.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that DMLCBO doesn't achieve the same convergence rate as SUSTAIN and MRBO. It suggests the authors discuss the reason and differences. This is explicit, so it's not implicit. But it's vague because it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to discuss or how to approach it. So, it's more than just an action; it's a suggestion but not very detailed. I think this is a 4 because it's explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to previous works by name, which is specific. It also mentions convergence rates, which are specific metrics. So, the grounding is strong because it clearly points to the relevant parts of the paper. I'd give this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that DMLCBO doesn't achieve the same rate and suggests discussing the reason. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's not verifiable. It's more of a statement than a claim with justification. So, this should be a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks key elements.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific issue and suggesting an improvement, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, though maybe a bit vague.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests mentioning a specific paper by Ulyanov et al. and comparing the current method with that class of methods. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this comparison, like whether they should add a discussion section or where exactly to place it. So it's explicit but lacks concrete details. I think this is a 4 because it's actionable but not fully concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific paper and suggests a comparison, so it's fully grounded. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is comparing with other methods. That should be a 5 because it's both grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the suggestion is to mention the paper and compare methods. It doesn't cite the paper specifically, which might make it harder for the authors to find it. Also, it doesn't provide a clear rationale for why this comparison is important. So it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out relevant prior work and suggests a meaningful comparison, which is helpful. It guides the authors in improving their work by placing their method in context. This is quite helpful, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect each aspect's evaluation.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the experiments are limited to toy data and suggests looking into real data. The action here is clear: the authors should consider expanding their experiments. But the review doesn't specify how to implement this, like suggesting specific real data sets or methods. So it's explicit in pointing out the need for change but lacks detail on how to do it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about toy data and real data. It doesn't explicitly name any sections or unique aspects of the paper, just mentions the type of data. So the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific part. But it does clearly suggest an issue with the current data type, which is specific enough. So I think it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that toy data is limiting and suggests real data. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's just an opinion without justification, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation and suggests improvements, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the first two sections are hard to read and that the author didn't explain the methods clearly. It then provides specific examples, like questions about Figure 2(a) and 2(b). The reviewer is pointing out that the author didn't explain how the LSTM conversion works. However, the reviewer doesn't tell the author exactly how to improve the explanation. They just ask for more details. So, this is an explicit action (pointing out the issue) but it's vague on how to fix it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer refers to specific sections of the paper, like Figure 2(a) and 2(b), and mentions specific lines, such as lines 43 and 96. They also ask detailed questions about the content. This shows that the reviewer is accurately pointing out the relevant parts of the paper. Additionally, they're being specific about what's unclear. So, this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the paper's unclear sections and the lack of clear explanations. However, they don't provide any evidence or reasoning to support these claims. They're just stating their observations without backing them up. So, this is **X: No Claim** because there's no justification or support given.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer does identify areas where the author can improve, which is helpful. They ask specific questions and provide examples, which gives the author clear directions for improvement. However, the suggestions are somewhat vague, so it's not the most helpful. It's **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and actionable but could be more detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points are \"Make the captions more descriptive.\" and \"Explain the scramble network better...\". Both are clear instructions, so they are explicit. However, they don't provide specific steps on how to make the captions more descriptive or explain the scramble network. For example, suggesting adding adjectives or providing more context isn't given. So, while the actions are explicit, the details are vague. That makes it a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions captions and the scramble network but doesn't specify which figure or part of the text. It's a bit vague. The comment doesn't reference any specific sections, tables, or unique elements of the paper. So, it's not fully grounded. Since it's not clearly pointing to a specific part, it's a **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does imply the parts but doesn't name them explicitly.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims like \"Make the captions more descriptive\" and \"Explain the scramble network better...\". These are opinions or suggestions. Now, checking if they're supported: there's no external references or logical reasoning provided. The suggestions are vague and don't reference any existing literature or data. So, it's **X: No Claim** because there's no justification or evidence backing these suggestions.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers suggestions but they are quite vague. It tells the authors to improve captions and explain a network but doesn't specify how. Without clear guidance, the feedback isn't very helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment points out that some abbreviations aren't defined, like \"NE\" on line 73. It also mentions that the superscript notation in equation 6 isn't defined until later in the document, which could hinder understanding. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the reviewer gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer does suggest that the authors define the abbreviations and clarify the notation. That's explicit. But does it tell them exactly how to do it? Not really; they just point out where the definitions are lacking. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this is a 4 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is regarding the paper's parts. The comment talks about \"some abbreviations are not defined\" and \"superscript notation in Eq 6 is not defined until much later.\" It doesn't explicitly name which section or equation, just mentions sections by line numbers and equation numbers. So, it's not fully grounded because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's a bit vague. I'd rate this a 3 because it's weakly grounded but does mention specific parts.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment includes claims like \"Some abbreviations are not defined\" and \"superscript notation in Eq 6 is not defined until much later.\" These are opinions or judgments. Now, are these claims supported? The reviewer suggests that the authors should define them, which is a logical suggestion. They also reference specific papers, which adds external support. So, the claims are somewhat justified with references. I think this is a 4 because it's mostly verifiable with some minor gaps.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does provide clear feedback on missing definitions and unclear notation, which is helpful. However, it doesn't suggest specific fixes or how to implement the changes. It's somewhat helpful but could be more so by offering actionable steps. I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly helpful with room for improvement in providing detailed suggestions.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, I think the scores are actionability: 4, grounding_specificity: 3, verifiability: 4, and helpfulness: 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"the evaluation is weak; the baselines used in the paper are not even designed for fair classification.\" It mentions baselines not being designed for fair classification, which seems like an explicit action. However, it doesn't specify how to improve the baselines or suggest any concrete changes. So, it's explicit but vague. That would make it borderline actionable because it's clear that something needs to be done, but the direction isn't clear.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about baselines not being designed for fair classification. It doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper is being addressed, like a specific section or method. It's making a general statement about the baselines, so the grounding is weak. Also, it's not providing specific examples or pointing out what's wrong with the baselines, so it's not specific either. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the review states that the baselines aren't designed for fair classification. This is a claim, and it's supported by the fact that the baselines aren't designed for it. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's a subjective opinion without justification, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a weakness in the baselines but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors know what to do next. So, it's not helpful at all.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 1 because they're all either borderline or unhelpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this peer review comment based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The comment says that Mao et al., 2020, used ADMM with two versions, and it's not accurate to say they used simple SGD. It also points out that \"it\" in the second part doesn't have a clear reference. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment gives clear instructions. The first part explains alternative methods, which is helpful, but the second part is vague about what \"it\" refers to. So, it's partially actionable but not fully explicit. I think this is a 4 because it's mostly clear but has some ambiguity.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions Mao et al., 2020, and ADMM, which is specific. It also refers to SGD in decentralized optimization, which is a clear point in the paper. The reference to Section 4.1 is explicit, so this is fully grounded and specific. That should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment provides specific details about ADMM versions and references a section for the ambiguous \"it\". This is thorough and supports the claims, so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment explains alternatives and corrects a reference, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful. That's a 5.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are 4, 5, 5, and 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding details to the Related Work section, specifically mentioning several methods like sparse-attention, segmentation-based approaches, etc. It also provides references. This seems explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. The references are concrete, so it's not vague. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific methods and references, so it clearly points to the Related Work section. It's not just a general suggestion but targets a specific part of the paper. The specificity is high because it details which areas to improve and what to discuss. So, this is probably a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides references to specific works, which are external sources. This means the claims are supported by existing literature, making it verifiable. It's thorough enough, so I'd rate this as 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is very clear and provides actionable suggestions with specific references. It helps the authors know exactly where to add content and what methods to discuss. This is comprehensive and useful, so it should be a 5.\n\nI don't see any issues with these scores. Each aspect is well-covered in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the proposed solution is an incremental step considering Guzman's work. It also mentions minor suggestions. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out that the solution is incremental but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be changed. It's vague, so it's not explicit. Since it's not giving concrete steps, it's probably not actionable. So, I'd rate this as 1 for unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is. The reviewer mentions Guzman's work but doesn't pin down exactly which part of the paper or what issue is being addressed. It's a bit vague, so they're not fully grounded. They also don't specify what needs to be done, which is a problem for grounding. So, this should be a 3, which is weakly grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer talks about Guzman's work but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why the solution is an incremental step. There's no justification or references, so it's not verifiable. This would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer does point out that the solution is incremental and offers minor suggestions. However, these suggestions are vague and don't provide clear guidance on what exactly needs to be changed. So, while it's helpful, it's not very detailed, making it a 2.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects. The review lacks in providing clear actions and grounding, isn't well-supported, and offers only minor suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this peer review comment based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment suggests improving results presentation by mentioning specific issues like ambiguous labels and missing runtime data in figures. It also proposes a scatter plot and highlights tables. It seems like the author is given clear directions on what to do, so that's explicit. The instructions are detailed enough that the author can follow them without much guesswork. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment points out specific parts of the paper, like Figure 2 and 3, and mentions what's missing, which is the runtime. It doesn't just say \"the figures need improvement\"; it specifies which figures and what's wrong. So, the author can pinpoint exactly where the issues are. Additionally, the comment suggests specific fixes, like a scatter plot and highlighting tables. This makes it well-grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment makes a claim that suggesting a scatter plot and highlighting tables would help the reader. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's more of a suggestion without justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the depth needed for full verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does provide clear feedback on specific issues and offers actionable suggestions. It's not vague; it tells the author exactly what to do. While it doesn't go into how to implement the suggestions beyond mentioning them, it's still highly helpful because it guides the author on what changes to make. There's no mention of being unhelpful or barely helpful, so it's definitely helpful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect seems to be at least a 4, but considering the detailed nature of actionability and specificity, they might both be 5. Verifiability is a bit lower because it lacks justification, so maybe a 3. Helpfulness is top-notch, so a 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using advantage instead of q-value but doesn't specify how to implement this change. It's vague, so it's not explicit. Since it doesn't provide concrete steps, it's not actionable. So, it's somewhere between 1 and 3. I think it's 3 because it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions using advantage instead of q-value but doesn't specify which part of the paper or why this change is needed. It's unclear, so it's not fully grounded. It's probably a weak ground because it doesn't pinpoint the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claim or suggestion. It's just a question, so it's an \"X\" because there's no claim to verify.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for information but doesn't provide any actionable feedback. It's not helpful because it doesn't guide the authors on how to improve their work. So, it's a 3 because it's somewhat helpful but lacks clarity.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says there are some writing errors, like \"informative informative\" on page 5 and \"performance\" on page 1. It mentions these issues but doesn't specify what needs to be fixed. So, the reviewer is pointing out problems but isn't giving clear instructions on how to correct them. That means the action isn't explicit. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions specific pages and mentions \"performance\" but doesn't explain why these are problematic. It doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper is being addressed beyond just the page numbers. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review states that there are writing errors but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to make the claim credible. Hence, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out some issues but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or explain why these are problems. It's vague and lacks depth, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very helpful overall. Therefore, helpfulness is 1.\n\nSo, all four aspects are rated as 1 because the review lacks explicit actions, clear grounding, verifiable claims, and helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The hGRU architecture seems pretty ad-hoc and not very well motivated.\" The first thing I notice is that it's pointing out an issue, but it's not giving a specific action. It's more of a statement than a suggestion. So, is this explicit or implicit? Well, it's not explicitly telling the authors what to do. They might infer that they need to make the architecture more motivated, but it's not clear how. So, I think this is more implicit. Since it's not giving a clear action or how to fix it, it's probably not actionable. So, I'd give it a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This is about how specific the review is. The comment says \"the hGRU architecture\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or why it's ad-hoc. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint exactly what's missing. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity would also be a 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a judgment that the hGRU is ad-hoc and not well motivated. But there's no supporting evidence or references. It's just an opinion without backing. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or references to back it up. Hence, verifiability is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem but doesn't suggest any fixes or improvements. It's just a critique without actionable steps. So, while it's somewhat helpful in pointing out an issue, it's not really helpful because it doesn't guide the authors on how to improve. Therefore, helpfulness is a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is scored as 1 except helpfulness, which is 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using s_n instead of s_t and asks for asymptotic performance and average return results with more environment steps. It also links to a GitHub repository. The action is clear: replace s_t with s_n and ask for specific data. The instructions are explicit, so this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but doesn't tell exactly how to implement the change, like where to make the substitution or how to compute the return results.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions replacing s_t with s_n, which is specific, and references a GitHub link, which is a specific resource. It doesn't just say \"improve the algorithm\" but points to exact code changes and provides a link, so this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It's just recommending a code change and asking for data. There's no logical reasoning or references provided, so this is **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is somewhat helpful because it suggests a specific change and asks for data, which gives the authors something to work on. However, it's vague about how to compute the return results and doesn't provide a clear methodology for the asymptotic performance, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the given review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review point says, \"I would tone down this statement, in my understanding, the neural network does not memorize an exact 'critical point' as such in TopoNet [24].\" The first part, \"I would tone down this statement,\" is an explicit action. However, the second part, \"in my understanding, the neural network does not memorize an exact 'critical point' as such in TopoNet [24],\" is vague. It doesn't specify how to tone down the statement or provide a clear method. So, it's not fully actionable. Therefore, it should be labeled as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions citing [24] to support the claim that the neural network doesn't memorize exact critical points. This is a clear reference to a specific part of the paper, so it's fully grounded. Additionally, it explains why the statement is made, which adds specificity. Therefore, it should be labeled as 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides a specific reference to literature, which supports the claim. However, the reasoning is a bit vague. It mentions the neural network not memorizing exact points but doesn't provide a logical explanation or examples. It's somewhat supported but lacks depth. So, it should be labeled as 3: Somewhat Verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review offers a specific suggestion to tone down a statement and cites a reference, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't cover all areas, like suggesting compression of the method section or fixing grammatical errors. It's somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive. Therefore, it should be labeled as 3: Somewhat Helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review mentions that Megatron's comparison is overrated and that COCO-LM's performance is close to other models like RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and DeBERTa. It suggests that if the author claims COCO-LM is parameter-efficient, the conclusion applies to those related works. However, the review doesn't specify exactly what needs to be changed or how to implement the suggestions. It's vague on the details, so it's not fully actionable. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit or concrete.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe review refers to other models but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It mentions general works like RoBERTa and ELECTRA but doesn't point to a specific section or figure in the paper. However, it does imply the relevance of these models without explicitly naming them, which is a form of grounding. So, it's weakly grounded but provides some specificity by mentioning these models.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe review contains a claim that Megatron's comparison is overrated and that COCO-LM's performance is comparable. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for these claims. The reasoning is vague, and there are no references or logical arguments provided. Therefore, it's not verifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review raises valid points about the comparison with other models and suggests improvements. It provides some direction for the authors to consider, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are vague, and the reviewer doesn't offer detailed guidance on how to proceed. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable, weakly grounded, not verifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the analysis from line 128 to 149 isn't convincing enough and points out that GS-P-50 has smaller class selectivity scores. It then explains that this means GS-P-50 shares more features while ResNet-50 learns more class-specific features. The authors hypothesize that additional context could reduce dependency. \n\nHmm, so the review is pointing out an observation and explaining it, but it's not giving clear steps on what the authors should do next. It mentions the hypothesis but doesn't specify how to test it or what changes to make. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give actionable steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So I'd rate it as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific parts of the paper, like Figure 3 and the GS-P-50 model, and mentions class selectivity scores. It also cites external references. The grounding is pretty solid because it clearly points to the figure and the models without making too many assumptions. So I think this is fully grounded, which would be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the analysis isn't convincing enough and provides some reasoning. It also references external papers, which adds credibility. However, the reasoning is a bit vague about why the class selectivity score indicates better representations. It could be more detailed. So it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out an important observation and provides some reasoning, which is helpful. It doesn't go into too much detail, though, and could be expanded. So it's somewhat helpful, probably a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the criteria provided, considering how explicit, grounded, verifiable, and helpful the review point is.\n</think>\n\n**Evaluation of Review Point:**\n\n- **Actionability**: The review points out an observation but lacks specific, actionable steps. It's somewhat actionable but not fully.  \n- **Grounding Specificity**: References specific parts of the paper and external sources, making it fully grounded.  \n- **Verifiability**: Provides some reasoning and references but could be more detailed. It's somewhat verifiable.  \n- **Helpfulness**: Offers relevant insights and some reasoning, making it somewhat helpful but could be expanded.\n\n**Final Scores:**\n\n- **actionability_label**: 3  \n- **grounding_specificity_label**: 5  \n- **verifiability_label**: 3  \n- **helpfulness_label**: 4  \n\nThis evaluation considers the explicitness, specificity, verifiability, and overall value to the authors, providing a balanced assessment of the review point."}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Some observations and subsequent design decisions might be hardware and software dependent.\" The definition for actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. This comment is pointing out a potential dependency, but it's not giving any specific actions or changes the authors should make. It's more of an observation without a clear next step. So, I think this is unactionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, actionability label is 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This is about how specific the review is in addressing a part of the paper. The comment here is talking about hardware and software dependence, but it's not clearly pointing to a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. It's a bit vague, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a statement about design decisions being hardware and software dependent. But it's not providing any justification or evidence for this claim. It's just an opinion without supporting references or logical reasoning. So, it's not verifiable. The label here is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a potential issue, but it's very vague. It doesn't suggest any specific changes or improvements. It's just stating a possibility without actionable steps. So, it's not very helpful. The helpfulness label is 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all labels are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the weak recovery problem is of theoretical interest and that the AMP algorithm might not be useful for non-Gaussian problems. It suggests that practical impact may be limited. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a limitation but doesn't specify exactly what the authors should do next. They don't give a clear action, like adding a section or modifying a method. So, it's not explicit. Is it vague? Yes, because they don't provide detailed steps on how to address the issue. So, this seems to be **3: Somewhat Actionable**, because it's vague but mentions an action.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about the weak recovery problem being theoretically interesting and the AMP algorithm's potential lack of use in non-Gaussian problems. They don't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a particular section or figure. They also don't give a specific example or reference. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The specificity is also low because they don't clearly explain what needs fixing. So, this is **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the weak recovery problem is of theoretical interest and that AMP might not work for non-Gaussian problems. They don't provide any justification or references to back this up. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out potential limitations but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or guidance on how to improve the work. It's somewhat vague and doesn't give the authors a clear path forward. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify an issue but lacks depth and actionable advice.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says the authors need to perform ablation experiments comparing their method with TubeR in terms of learnable parameters and GFLOPs. That sounds like a clear action, so it's explicit. But does it give enough detail? The reviewer mentions specific metrics but doesn't explain how to implement the experiments or where to find the necessary data. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That would make it borderline actionable because it's clear what needs to be done, but the method isn't fully specified.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to comparing with TubeR, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper this applies to. It's a bit vague. The reviewer mentions metrics but doesn't tie it back to a specific section or figure in the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded, so the grounding_specificity would be weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a suggestion to perform experiments but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why these experiments are necessary. It's just a recommendation without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing for the claim.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is suggesting a specific experiment but doesn't explain why it's important or how it relates to the paper's contributions. The feedback is somewhat specific but lacks context, making it somewhat helpful. It gives a direction but doesn't fully address the authors' needs comprehensively.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores would be: actionability 4, grounding_specificity 2, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions specific questions about other bit operations, suggests analyzing energy consumption as a reference did, and asks for more explanations. These are all clear actions the authors can take. The comment is explicit about what needs to be done, so that's good. It doesn't just suggest vague improvements but actually points out specific areas for the authors to focus on. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while the actions are clear, maybe they could be more detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 5a and other bit operations by name, which is pretty specific. It also mentions analyzing energy consumption, which ties into an external reference, making it grounded. The specificity is high because it's not just a general critique but points to exact parts of the paper and suggests a particular analysis. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review includes specific suggestions like analyzing energy consumption as in reference [15]. This provides a clear method for the authors to follow, making the claim verifiable. The reasoning is logical, and the reference is explicit, so it's thoroughly supported. Therefore, this is **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides actionable suggestions. It doesn't just point out problems but also offers ways to improve the paper by referencing existing work. This makes it very helpful for the authors. So, this should be **5: Highly Helpful**.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, the helpfulness was given as 4. Maybe I should double-check. The review does provide specific actions and references, so it's quite helpful. Perhaps it's better to give it a higher score. I think 5 makes more sense because it's not just helpful but thoroughly constructive.\n\nSo, after reconsidering, I'll adjust the helpfulness to 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point says, \"Please define the dashed lines in fig. 2A-B and 4B.\" I need to determine if this is actionable. Actionable comments should tell the author exactly what to do. In this case, the reviewer is asking the author to define specific elements in the figures. However, it's quite vague. The author might not know exactly which parts of the dashed lines to define or how to do it. So, it's not explicit enough. It's more of a request without clear instructions, making it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this falls under a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the comment is. The reviewer is pointing out specific figures (2A-B and 4B) and asking for definitions. So, the author can identify exactly where to focus. This seems grounded because the comment is pointing to specific parts of the paper. However, the comment is just asking for a definition without explaining why or what's wrong with it. So, it's grounded but not very specific in terms of addressing issues. I'd rate this a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The comment is a request for information, not a claim. There's no assertion or suggestion made, so it doesn't require verification. It's more of a factual statement. Therefore, verifiability isn't an issue here, and it should be marked as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is asking the author to define specific elements in the figures. While it's a helpful direction, it's quite generic. The author might not know how to proceed without more detailed guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this a 3 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the specifics of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the description in Section 4.2 doesn't match the equation and points out missing terms like r^q and explains the sigma symbol. It also suggests clarifying the equation's terms. The comment is explicit about the issues and provides clear directions, so it's actionable. It doesn't seem vague, so I think it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Section 4.2 and specifically points out missing terms in the equation. It's clear and specific about which part of the paper is being addressed, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is good because it explains exactly what's missing and how to address it.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides clear explanations and references (like the sigmoid activation) to support its claims. It doesn't just state the problem but also why it's an issue and how to fix it, which makes it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is detailed, pointing out specific issues and providing actionable suggestions. It helps the authors understand where improvements are needed and how to make them, so it's highly helpful.\n\nOverall, each aspect seems to be at the highest level, so I'll assign a 5 to each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors reduced whitespace but didn't mention anything about equations or captions. It just says \"this by itself is grounds for rejection.\" I think the comment is explicit because it tells the authors what to do, but it's vague because it doesn't specify which parts to fix. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 2 or 3? I'm leaning towards 1 because it's a bit unclear.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about whitespace but doesn't specify which equations or captions. It's too vague. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the issue. Maybe a 1 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment claims that reducing whitespace violates the 9-page limit. But it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to back this up. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't offer specific solutions. It just says it's grounds for rejection. That's not helpful because authors need guidance on what to do next. So, it's barely helpful at best, maybe a 1.\n\nOverall, all aspects seem to be lacking in either specificity, detail, or justification.

It's clear that the authors should perform such experiments, but the method isn't detailed. So, it's explicit in pointing out the action but lacks concrete details. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Figure 1 and specific datasets like SEMAINE and UNBC. It accurately points out where the differences are, so the grounding is strong. Also, it clearly explains what needs to be addressed, making it **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claim is that cross-dataset experiments are a good test. The reasoning is that it's a logical suggestion, and it's supported by common knowledge about the importance of generalization in methods. There's no external reference, but the logic is solid, so it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a clear weakness (lack of cross-dataset experiments) and suggests a solution. It's specific and actionable, so it's **Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. I should make sure each score aligns with the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Very difficult to follow the motivation of this paper. And it looks like an incremental engineering paper.\" The first part, \"Very difficult to follow the motivation,\" is a statement of difficulty but doesn't specify what needs to be done. The second part, \"And it looks like an incremental engineering paper,\" is a general observation without any actionable suggestions. So, there's no explicit or implicit action being suggested here. The authors don't know what changes to make. Therefore, this is unactionable, which would be a score of 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions the paper's difficulty in following the motivation and that it's incremental. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper is problematic. It's too vague. There's no mention of sections, tables, figures, or unique aspects. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint where the issue lies. Hence, this should also be a score of 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review contains claims like \"difficult to follow the motivation\" and \"incremental engineering paper.\" However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for these claims. They're just opinions without backing. So, it's unverifiable, giving it a score of 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out issues but lacks specific suggestions. It's vague and doesn't guide the authors on what changes to make. Therefore, it's only somewhat helpful, but not fully. So, a score of 2 makes sense here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review point suggests adding more sentences on the experimental setting and explaining the learning curves. It also asks specific questions about accuracy and structural collapse. Explicitly asking for these details means the author knows exactly what to do, so it's explicit. Since it provides clear instructions, it's not vague. So, this should be a higher score. I think it's 4 because it's clear but maybe not the most detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific sections like Fig 3 and tasks like the last task and average accuracy. It accurately points to these parts, so it's fully grounded. It also explains what needs to be addressed, which is specific. So, this should be a high score, probably 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review includes questions and suggestions but doesn't back them up with evidence or references. It just asks why the learning curves matter and whether worse models cause structural collapse. There's no supporting data or logical reasoning, so it's unverifiable. I'll give it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is clear and specific about what needs to be done, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide much depth or examples, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I think a 3 is appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review suggests including a plot comparing SGC and LoRA. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. The comment also provides a clear method for how to implement this change, which is to create a sparsity vs. performance plot. That seems concrete, so I think this is highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions a specific part of the paper, the tradeoff between flexibility and practicality of PEFT methods. It also suggests a visual comparison, which is a specific recommendation. The authors can easily pinpoint where to focus their improvements. So, this is fully grounded and specific. I'll rate it a 5 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a clear claim that a plot would demonstrate the benefits. It supports this claim by explaining how the plot would show the tradeoff and suggesting a specific visualization. The reasoning is logical and provides enough justification without needing external references. So, this is mostly verifiable, but since it's thorough, I'll give it a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment addresses a clear weakness in the paper's analysis by suggesting a visual comparison. It provides a specific, actionable recommendation without being vague. The feedback is directly tied to the paper's claims and offers a practical solution. This makes it highly helpful because it guides the authors on exactly what to improve. So, I'll rate this a 5.\n\nOverall, the review point is clear, specific, and provides actionable suggestions that will help the authors improve their work effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

The action is explicit\u2014 authors need to give examples and explain the model. The instructions are clear, so this is explicit action. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells exactly what to do: add examples, explain the model, and include it in the appendix. So, it's highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figure 1 and asks about \"support data\" and \"predicted training count data.\" It doesn't specify which part of the figure or what exactly to add. The grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or element. However, it does clearly specify what needs to be addressed, which is specificity. So, it's a bit specific but not fully grounded. I think this deserves a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is asking for examples and model explanation.

It doesn't specify what changes the authors should make. So, the action is implicit, and there's no concrete guidance. That makes it unactionable, so I'll give it a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific sections, like Section 5, which is good.

It's explicit about the need for explanation and differentiation. However, it doesn't provide specific steps or methods, so the action is clear but lacks detail. This makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nFor **Grounding_specificity**, the comment refers to morphologic segmentation across domains without pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's vague, so the grounding is weak. But it does imply a need for discussion, which is better than nothing. So, it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nNext, **Verifiability**: The comment is a claim suggesting that morphologic segmentation is invariant across domains. There's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's vague and lacks backing, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review raises important points about domain differences but doesn't provide concrete solutions or examples. It's clear that the authors need more information, but the suggestion is somewhat vague. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the analysis of experimental results is insufficient. It mentions that the scope prompting method shows poor performance on GPT-3.5-turbo but doesn't provide any analysis of why this happened. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The comment does state that the analysis is insufficient, which is explicit. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. It just points out the problem but doesn't suggest improvements. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what to do. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement the change.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the experimental results but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It mentions the scope prompting method and the model used but doesn't tie it back to a specific section or figure in the paper. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded, so it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention what's wrong but doesn't clearly explain how to fix it.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the analysis is insufficient. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just stating an opinion without backing it up. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or examples given. That would be **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it does have a claim but lacks justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a problem but doesn't suggest any solutions. It tells the authors where the issue is but doesn't guide them on how to improve it. Without specific advice, it's not very helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that performance and sample efficiency are sensitive to \u03bb parameters and provides some citations. It also asks the authors to explain how \u03bb is computed. The comment is explicit about the need to understand \u03bb's computation, which is a direct action. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to compute \u03bb or provide a method, so it's a bit vague. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \u03bb parameters and cites external works. It doesn't explicitly mention specific sections or parts of the paper, so the grounding is weak. However, it does point to relevant literature, which helps authors understand the context. Since it's pointing out a specific issue without being too vague, I'd rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that \u03bb's sensitivity affects sample efficiency and asks for an explanation. It cites external papers, which supports the claim. The references are relevant and provide some justification, but the explanation is a bit brief. I think this is \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because there's some support but not enough depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for an explanation of \u03bb's computation and referencing some papers. It's clear and provides direction for the authors, but it doesn't offer a detailed method or further context. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive. I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything. The actionability is about how actionable the comment is. It's clear but vague on details, so 4 out of 5. Grounding is weak but specific in pointing to literature, so 3 out of 5. Verifiability is somewhat supported by references, so 3 out of 5. Helpfulness is clear and guides the authors, so 4 out of 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the novelty is limited and mentions interpreting deep neural networks using a linear model isn't new. It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. So, it's not giving them a clear action to improve their work. That means it's not actionable. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment points out that interpreting deep neural networks with a linear model isn't novel. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to or what exactly needs to be changed. It's too vague about the specific issue. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that using a linear model for interpretation isn't novel. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable. That gives it a 1 in verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a lack of novelty but doesn't offer any specific suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much. So, it's not very helpful. I'd rate this as 1 for helpfulness as well.\n\nOverall, the review is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the experiments should be more comprehensive and general. It mentions that the model size is limited and the baselines are restrictive for both tasks. Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. \n\nLooking at the definitions, an explicit action would be something like recommending a specific change, while an implicit one is more vague. Here, the reviewer is suggesting improvements but doesn't specify exactly what to do. They mention making the experiments more comprehensive but don't give concrete steps. So, it's not fully explicit. It's also not vague because they do point out specific issues with model size and baselines. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe it's somewhere between explicit and vague. I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because they do suggest changes but don't detail how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about whether the review refers to a specific part of the paper. The review talks about both tasks, language modeling and image classification, and mentions model size and baselines. It seems like they are pointing out issues in the methods section where these parameters are discussed. So, they are accurately pinpointing the sections. That would be **Full Grounding**. Then, they specify what's wrong: the model size is limited and baselines are restrictive. That's pretty specific. So, it's **Specific**. Combining both, it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the experiments need improvement. It's a claim because it's suggesting a change. Now, is this claim supported? The reviewer doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning. They just state that the experiments are limited. Without justification, it's hard to verify. So, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out areas for improvement but doesn't give detailed suggestions or specify how to make the experiments more comprehensive. It's somewhat vague. So, it's not **5: Highly Helpful** or **4: Mostly Helpful**. It's more like **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify issues but lacks depth or detail in the suggestions.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect each aspect's evaluation based on the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding an ablation study to explain the choice of using few-shot examples for CoT. It doesn't specify exactly how to implement this, like whether it should be a separate section or how to analyze the results. So, it's an explicit action but lacks detail on the implementation. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions adding an ablation study but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing.

It's just a recommendation without supporting evidence, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting an ablation study but doesn't elaborate on why it's necessary or how it will help.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Evidently, replacing any of the procedure steps of XAIFOILER with a random mechanism dropped its performance\" and then adds, \"I'm unsure that 'better than random' is a strong demonstration of capability.\" \n\nFirst, I check if there's an explicit action. The first part talks about replacing steps with a random mechanism affecting performance, which is explicit. However, the second part is a statement of uncertainty, which is more of an implicit action. The reviewer is questioning the strength of the performance improvement, but it's not a direct instruction on what to do next. So, it's not fully actionable because the reviewer isn't suggesting a specific change or improvement. Therefore, it's probably a **2: Borderline Actionable** because there's some action mentioned, but it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions XAIFOILER and talks about replacing steps with a random mechanism. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or which procedure steps are being referred to. The mention is too vague, so the grounding is weak. Also, the reviewer is unsure about the strength of the demonstration, which doesn't add much specificity. So, this is **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because the part being addressed isn't clearly identified, and the issue isn't clearly specified.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that \"replacing any of the procedure steps with a random mechanism dropped its performance.\" This is a claim because it's making a judgment about the performance impact. However, the justification is vague. The reviewer mentions uncertainty about whether \"better than random\" is a strong demonstration but doesn't provide specific references or logical reasoning to back this up. There's no external data or clear explanation, so it's **2: Borderline Verifiable** because there's some support, but it's unclear and insufficient.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides some feedback by pointing out that replacing steps with a random mechanism affected performance. However, the second part is a critique without offering clear suggestions. The feedback is somewhat helpful but lacks depth and clarity. It doesn't guide the authors on how to improve, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because there's partial feedback, but it's incomplete.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 2\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"the results in section 4 apply only to shallow fully-connected ReLU networks.\" It doesn't specify what needs to be done next. The authors aren't told to remove something or add something. It's just a statement of a limitation. So, there's no explicit action or suggestion. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions section 4 and ReLU networks. It's pretty specific about which part of the paper and what kind of network. But it's just stating a fact without explaining why it's an issue or what to do about it. So, it's grounded because it points to a specific section, but it's not specific in explaining the problem or suggesting a fix. I think this is a 1 because it's grounded but not specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the results apply only to shallow networks. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an observation without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a limitation but doesn't tell the authors what to do about it. It's vague and doesn't offer actionable steps. So, while it's helpful in pointing out an issue, it's not very helpful because it lacks direction. I'd rate this as 2 because it's somewhat helpful but not fully so.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says the experiments aren't sufficient and suggests more empirical or toy experiments. It also mentions citing Kaplan et al. 2020. The action here is clear: do more experiments and cite a reference. It's explicit, so that's good. The details are specific about the types of experiments and the citation, so it's not vague. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions \"more empirical experiments\" and \"toy experiments\" for a specific model. It's clear which part of the paper they're referring to, the simplified self-attention model. They also suggest citing a specific work. So the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the relevant sections and provides a clear example. That's a 5 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the experiments are insufficient and suggests improvements. It provides a logical reasoning by mentioning additional experiments and citing another paper. However, it doesn't go into depth about why more experiments are needed or how they would specifically address the issues. So it's somewhat justified but lacks some key elements. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review clearly identifies a problem and provides actionable suggestions. It tells the authors what to do and why, which is helpful. The mention of citing another paper adds credibility, making it more useful. It's detailed enough to be highly helpful, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nOverall, the review is quite thorough and constructive, addressing both the problem and the solution clearly and effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the absolute value operation in the Frobenius norm definition is unnecessary because tensor entries are real numbers. This is an explicit statement, so it's clear what needs to be done. The comment is specific about the line mentioned, which is line 77. It also explains why the absolute value isn't needed, providing a concrete action. So, this seems like it's both explicit and concrete. I think this should be a high score for actionability, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment references line 77, which is a specific part of the paper. It doesn't make any vague generalizations or imply other sections. The mention is precise, so this has full grounding. It also explains why the absolute value isn't needed, which adds specificity. Therefore, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the Frobenius norm doesn't require absolute values because tensor entries are real. This is a well-known fact in mathematics, so it's supported by common knowledge. There's no need for external references or detailed reasoning. It's a straightforward claim with solid justification, so this should be a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out a minor issue but doesn't elaborate on how to fix it or suggest any changes. It's clear that the authors need to remove the absolute value, but without specific instructions on how to do that, it's somewhat helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding experiments where the image is occluded. It mentions two purposes: simulating data irregularity and testing the model's inference capacity. The reviewer also notes these should be easy to run. This seems explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. The action is clear\u2014add these experiments. Additionally, the reviewer provides specific details about the experiments, so the authors know exactly how to implement them. Therefore, this is highly actionable. I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions specific experiments\u2014occluding half the image, simulating data irregularity, and testing inference capacity. They also suggest these are easy to run, which implies they know where to focus. This is fully grounded because the reviewer accurately identifies the parts of the paper or unique aspects being addressed. They're not just making a general comment but pointing out specific areas. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer's claim is that these experiments are reasonable and easy to run. They provide some reasoning, like simulating data irregularity and testing inference capacity, but it's not very detailed. They don't cite external references or provide a lot of justification beyond their own judgment. This is somewhat verifiable because there's some reasoning, but it's not robust or detailed. So, I'd rate this a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer offers clear suggestions for experiments, explaining their purposes and why they're beneficial. They also make it sound like these experiments shouldn't be too hard to run, which is helpful for the authors. While it's not the most detailed, it's still very helpful and actionable. I'd give this a 5.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, each aspect seems to be addressed well, with clear and specific suggestions that the authors can follow without much ambiguity.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using a second y-axis or another visualization. That's pretty explicit, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The suggestion is to use a second y-axis, which is specific. So, I think this is highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to do. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions figure 6C and suggests a specific solution. It clearly identifies the part of the paper (figure 6C) and what needs to be done. So, it's fully grounded and specific. That's a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the suggestion is to use a second y-axis. While it's a good suggestion, I'm not sure if there's any external reference or specific example provided. It's more of a general recommendation. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out an issue with figure 6C and suggests an improvement. It's clear and provides a specific change.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the motivation should be further justified and points out that the paper doesn't consider how to effectively use \"few-shot\" and guarantee generalization. It seems like the review is giving a clear direction for improvement, so that's explicit. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to do this, like specific methods or steps. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to \"few-shot learning\" and specifically talks about graph link prediction. It mentions the few-shot situation and the need for generalization. The authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is, so that's fully grounded. But it doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done, like which techniques to use. So it's grounded but not specific. That's a 3 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests improvements but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just states that the motivation needs justification and points out the missing elements. There's no logical reasoning or external sources backing up the claims, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 3 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does identify areas for improvement and explains why they're important, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide specific suggestions or methods for how to address these issues. It's clear and gives some direction, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. A 4 seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says, \"It is not clear if the proposed methodology is specific to bimanual manipulation. Just using robotic manipulation could be more appropriate.\" The author is suggesting that the methodology isn't specific enough and that using robotic manipulation instead might be better. \n\nIs this action clear? The reviewer is pointing out a lack of specificity, which is an explicit action. However, the comment doesn't tell the author exactly what to do next. They know the methodology isn't specific to bimanual, but they aren't told to add a section or make changes. So, it's explicit but not concrete. That makes it **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"the proposed methodology is specific to bimanual manipulation\" and suggests using robotic manipulation instead. The reviewer is referring to the methodology by type (bimanual vs. robotic), which is explicit. They're pinpointing a specific part of the methodology, so the grounding is clear. The specificity is about suggesting an alternative, which is clear. So, this should be **3: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the methodology isn't specific enough. It's a claim, but there's no supporting evidence or justification. The reviewer isn't providing any references or logical reasoning to back up why bimanual manipulation is necessary or why robotic is better. So, it's not verifiable. That's a **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out a potential improvement but doesn't specify how to implement it. It's clear that robotic manipulation might be better, but the reviewer doesn't tell the author to do anything specific. It's helpful in identifying an area for improvement but lacks actionable steps. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that UNIFORM doesn't always offer a clear advantage, especially in the 1-shot setting, and asks if the authors have a theory. It also praises clarity and experiments. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors to provide a theory. But does it give a clear action? Maybe not exactly how to go about it. It's more of a question, so perhaps it's explicit but vague. I'm leaning towards 4 because it's clear that an explanation is needed but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the 1-shot setting without explicitly naming it. It's a bit vague about what exactly is missing. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific part of the paper. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests the authors provide a theory but doesn't back it up. It's a claim without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable. Maybe a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and constructive, pointing out a gap and suggesting improvements. It's helpful but could be more detailed. So, a 4 seems right.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Actionability: 4 because it's clear but vague. Grounding: 3 because it's not specific. Verifiability: 1 because no evidence. Helpfulness: 4 because it's helpful but could be more detailed. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests the author provide additional clarification on how adjusting amplitudes affects model accuracy and explains why these adjustments are effective. It also mentions the spacing in the equations. These are both explicit actions the author can take. Moreover, the review gives clear instructions on what to do, so the action is concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions Figure 3, which is specific, and talks about Equations (9) and (10), which are precise references. The reviewer is pointing out specific parts of the paper, so this is fully grounded. Also, the comments are clear about what needs to be addressed, making it specific. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims about the adjustments affecting model accuracy and the spacing in equations. However, the justification is vague. The reviewer doesn't provide any reasoning or references, so it's not fully verifiable. It's more of a request for clarification rather than a claim supported by evidence. So, I'll rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is clear and provides specific suggestions, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into detail about why the adjustments are effective or how they work, which could make it more helpful. So, it's mostly helpful, giving it a 4.\n\nOverall, the review is effective in prompting the author to take specific actions, clearly references parts of the paper, but lacks detailed justification for the claims made.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests improving Figure 1 by showing a processing pipeline. It mentions specific actions like prompt generation, manual checks, demonstration selection, ground truth scores, automatic scoring, and model training optimization. These are all explicit actions the authors can take. Plus, it provides clear details on how to implement each action, like demonstrating with ground truth scores. So this seems highly actionable. I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific parts of Figure 1 that need improvement. It mentions prompt generation, manual checks, demonstration selection, and model training. The authors can easily pinpoint where the figure needs work. It's not just a vague comment; it's very specific about the figure's components. So this should be fully grounded and specific, scoring a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that Figure 1 can be improved in these specific ways. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestions. However, the claims are clear and based on the authors' own understanding of the figure's components. It's somewhat verifiable but lacks deeper justification. So I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear and actionable feedback. It tells the authors exactly what to do and how to do it. While it could be expanded, it's already quite helpful. So a 4 seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review mentions that \"abbreviations like 'MoCo' should not appear in the section header.\" It suggests removing them because a reader might not know what MoCo stands for. This is an explicit action\u2014clearly telling the authors what to do. Now, is this action concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly where to make the change (section header) and what to do (remove the abbreviation). So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to \"MoCo\" in the section header. But does it specifically identify which part of the paper it's addressing? It just mentions the section header without pointing out exactly where the issue is. So, the grounding isn't explicit. It's a bit vague because the authors might have to infer where exactly the problem is. Therefore, this is weakly grounded. Also, it doesn't specify what needs to be addressed beyond removing the abbreviation. So, it's not fully specific. I'd rate this a 3 because it's weakly grounded but somewhat specific.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review is a suggestion to remove an abbreviation, which is a claim. But there's no justification or reasoning provided. It just says \"should not appear\" without explaining why or citing any standards. So, there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. I'll give this a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is clear about what needs to be done but doesn't provide any reasoning or context. It's straightforward but lacks depth. It's helpful in that it points out a problem, but it doesn't help the authors understand why it's a problem or how to fix it beyond the suggestion. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I think a 4 is appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The technical contribution is unclear. Most of the analysis are quite standard.\" Hmm, the first part, \"The technical contribution is unclear,\" is a statement of fact, but it doesn't tell the author what to do next. The second part, \"Most of the analysis are quite standard,\" also points out an issue but doesn't suggest an action. So, this isn't giving any explicit or implicit actions. Therefore, it's unactionable. I'll give it a 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the technical contribution is unclear\" and \"most of the analysis are quite standard.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper is unclear or where the standard analysis is lacking. The author can't pinpoint the issue, so it's not grounded. I'll rate this a 1 as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the review makes a claim that the technical contribution is unclear and that most analyses are standard. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating opinions without supporting evidence, so it's not verifiable. That's a 1 here too.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out issues, but it's vague and doesn't offer specific suggestions. The author still needs to figure out what changes to make. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully detailed or actionable. I'll rate this a 2.\n\nOverall, the review is lacking in providing clear actions and grounding, isn't verifiable, and only somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

It mentions a lack of a sparsity constraint but doesn't specify what to do next. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nFor grounding_specificity, the review doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's addressing. It talks about the model lacking a constraint but doesn't specify which section or figure. So, it's not grounded.\n\nRegarding verifiability, the claim is that the model will increase the number of factors with more tasks, but there's no justification or reference provided. It's vague and lacks support, making it unverifiable.\n\nIn terms of helpfulness, the review is pointing out a potential issue but doesn't offer actionable steps or explanations.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors applied regularization in the form of a cropped stimulus but doesn't specify how exactly they should do this. It feels a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to know exactly what to do. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does explicitly state an action but lacks detail on how to implement it. So, the actionability label should be 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the LN model needing regularization and mentions specific techniques used by Pillow et al. It clearly points out what needs to be addressed, which is a good sign. Also, it specifies what the issue is, so it's well-grounded. I don't see any issues here, so this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific,\" which is a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the GLM didn't use L1 regularization and suggests a fair comparison. It provides some justification by mentioning Pillow et al.'s methods, which is helpful. However, it's not entirely clear or comprehensive. So, it's \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because it has some justification but lacks key elements. The label here would be 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a discrepancy and suggests a comparison, which is helpful. However, it's quite brief and doesn't go into much detail. It provides some value but isn't very comprehensive. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful,\" which is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the review point's content.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests introducing epsilon in equation (11) for clarity. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly where to make the change. The action is clear\u2014introduce epsilon in (11). It's not vague or implicit. So, this should be highly actionable. I think it's a 5 here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions equation (11) but doesn't specify what exactly is wrong with equation (10). It just says epsilon isn't used there. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint the issue clearly. It's not fully grounded. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests introducing epsilon for clarity. It's a subjective judgment, so it's a claim. But there's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. It's vague and lacks justification. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and actionable, which is good. It helps the authors know exactly where to make the change. However, it's somewhat vague by not explaining why introducing epsilon is necessary or how it improves clarity. So, it's mostly helpful but not fully comprehensive. I'd give this a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out two issues in the proof of Theorem A.3. It says the input x has two indices because it's a vector, not a matrix, and also questions the equation \u2211 k ( W k (2) )\u00b2 = 1/d instead of d. The comment is explicit about the issues and provides specific details, so it's clear what needs to be fixed. However, it doesn't suggest exact modifications, like whether to change the matrix to a vector or adjust the equation. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps, making it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the input x being a vector and the specific equation, which are specific parts of the paper. It doesn't make general comments or guess which part to address. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the sections being discussed. Therefore, it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the input x is a vector, not a matrix, and that the equation should be 1/d instead of d. These are factual statements that can be verified through the paper's definitions or by checking the context. There's no external reference needed, but the reasoning is clear. So, it's **X: No Claim** because it's more of a critique than a claim requiring justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issues and provides specific points for improvement. However, it doesn't suggest exact fixes, like changing the matrix or adjusting the equation. It's helpful but could be more so if it included concrete modification steps. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions missing supervised baselines and suggests adding them. It also provides some reasoning about the dataset size and the benefits of full annotation. The action here is clear: add supervised baselines. The reasoning is explicit, so it's not implicit. The instructions say that explicit actions are better than implicit ones, so this should be a high score. I think it's 5 because it's both explicit and provides concrete steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about experiments on datasets with ~100k images and suggests full annotation as a baseline. It doesn't mention specific sections of the paper, just the dataset size. However, it does clearly explain why full annotation is beneficial, which is specific enough. So, it's fully grounded and specific. That should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that adding supervised baselines is a good idea, supported by the reasoning about dataset size and the benefits of full annotation. The reasoning is logical and provides clear justification, so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a clear weakness (missing baselines) and provides specific suggestions. It also explains the reasoning well, which helps the authors understand how to improve. This is very helpful, so a 5 makes sense.\n\nI don't see any issues with these scores. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and the review point fits well into each category.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review suggests changing a set to a multiset in section 4. It mentions that the histogram should include multiplicities because repeated labels are needed. The comment is explicit about the action (changing the set to a multiset) and provides clear instructions on why this change is necessary. It also explains how to implement it by mentioning multiplicities. This makes the action both explicit and concrete. Therefore, it should be highly actionable.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe comment specifically refers to section 4 and mentions the need for multiplicities in the graph labels. It doesn't just say \"change this part,\" but rather explains why the change is needed. It also hints at the specific reason (histogram representing repeated labels). This strong indication of the specific part being addressed makes it well grounded. Additionally, it clearly states what needs to be done, which adds specificity. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe comment suggests a mathematical change (using a multiset instead of a set) and explains why it's necessary for accurately representing repeated labels. It doesn't reference external literature but uses logical reasoning to support the claim. The explanation is clear and logical, making the claim verifiable. Therefore, it should be fully verifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review provides a clear suggestion, explains the reasoning, and indicates how to implement the change. It directly addresses a specific issue in the paper without being vague. This makes the feedback helpful and actionable for the authors. Therefore, it should be highly helpful.\n\nI think each aspect is at the highest level possible because the review is explicit, specific, verifiable, and helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the writing could be improved and suggests adding a table to compare CoT prompting methods. It also asks two specific questions about assumptions and selection criteria. The action is clear\u2014adding a table\u2014but the instructions on how to do that aren't detailed. So, it's explicit that they need to add a table, but not how to create it or where to place it. That makes it somewhat actionable because they know what to do, but not exactly how. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to section 4.2 for selection criteria. It's specific about the questions and rationales, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where to look. The specificity is high because it clearly states what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes claims about the writing being good and suggests improvements. It also asks questions that require justification, like why certain assumptions are made and if criteria are reasonable. The reasoning is provided, and references to section 4.2 are there, which adds credibility. So, it's thoroughly supported, making it fully verifiable. I'll give this a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about weaknesses and provides specific suggestions. It asks detailed questions, which should help the authors improve. While it's not super extensive, it's comprehensive enough to be helpful.

But it doesn't tell them exactly what to do next, like how to perform the test or where to find resources. So it's explicit but not concrete. I think this should be a 4 because it's clear they need to do something but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review points out a specific part of the paper, like the comparison between different models. It clearly states what's wrong, which is good. It doesn't mention external work, so it's not using examples, but it's specific about the issue. I'd rate this a 4 because it's grounded but doesn't provide examples.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the authors didn't do significance testing. It suggests they should perform the test but doesn't provide any references or examples. It's clear, though, so it's somewhat verifiable. I think a 3 makes sense here because it's clear but lacks supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a problem and suggesting a solution, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, so it's a 4. It doesn't go into too much detail, but it's enough to guide the authors.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 4, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"Results should be averaged over multiple runs to determine statistical significance.\" I remember that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do: average the results. But is it concrete? It tells them what to do, but it doesn't specify how to average them, like whether to take the mean, median, or something else. So it's explicit but not concrete. I think that makes it a 4 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment is about statistical significance, so it's not directly pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's more of a general methodological advice. The authors might not know exactly where to apply this, so it's not fully grounded. It's not weakly grounded either because it's not vague about which part. But it's not fully specific either because it doesn't explain how to apply the averaging. So I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting a method to check results, which is a claim. It's supported by common knowledge about statistical methods, so it's somewhat verifiable. It doesn't cite external references, though, so it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment is clear and suggests a methodological improvement, which is helpful. It's not vague, and it gives a specific action, even though it's not fully detailed. So it's somewhat helpful but not the most. I'd give it a 4.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Actionability was explicit but not concrete, so 4. Grounding was not specific, so 3. Verifiability was a claim with some support, so 3. Helpfulness was clear and specific enough, so 4. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"In my opinion, the contribution of this paper appears somewhat limited, and the proposed model seems incremental in its approach.\" The author is expressing an opinion about the paper's contribution and the model's approach. But there's no specific action suggested. The reviewer isn't telling the authors what to do or how to improve. So, this is more of a general statement without any actionable steps. Therefore, it's not actionable because there's no clear direction for the authors to follow. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions the paper's contribution and the model's approach but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is limited or incremental. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issues are, so the grounding is weak. There's no specific section, table, or figure mentioned, and it's not clear what needs to be addressed. So, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review contains a claim that the contribution is limited and the model is incremental. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for these claims. The reviewer is just stating their opinion without backing it up with references or logical reasoning. So, it's not verifiable because there's no proof provided. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out some issues with the paper and the model, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide specific suggestions or actions for the authors to take. It's more of a critique without concrete guidance. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful because it lacks actionable steps. Therefore, helpfulness is 1.\n\nIn summary, all four aspects are rated as 1 because the review lacks explicit actions, specific grounding, verifiable claims, and actionable suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper verifies different metrics for different OPE methods and points out differences in Figure 4 and 5. It ends with a request for comments on the differences between evaluation methods. Explicitly, it's asking for a discussion, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify what exactly to do next, like suggesting changes or improvements. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement the feedback. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** (3).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 4 and 5 by name, which is a clear mention of specific parts of the paper. It also talks about differences in evaluation methods, which are specific aspects. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the sections and the specific issue without needing more context. That's a **Fully Grounded and Specific** (5).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment about the differences in evaluation methods but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an observation without supporting evidence. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable** (3) because it has some justification but lacks key elements like examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest looking at the figures and proposes a discussion on the differences. It's clear and provides some actionable feedback. However, it's not very detailed, so while it's helpful, it's not the most comprehensive. That makes it **Somewhat Helpful** (3).\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring that each label is justified.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the regularization term is ad-hoc and lacks theoretical support. It suggests using other statistics like the median instead of the mean. The comment is explicit about the action\u2014suggesting changes to the regularization. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to replace the mean and standard deviation with the median. So, it's clear that an action is needed, but the details are vague. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** (label 3).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review points out that the author's explanation is intuitive but lacks theoretical support. It mentions specific statistics like the median as alternatives. The comment clearly references specific parts of the paper (regularization terms) and suggests alternatives, so it's **Fully Grounded and Specific** (label 5).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the regularization is ad-hoc and lacks support. It suggests using the median instead of the mean. While it's a valid claim, it doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up why the median is a better choice. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth, so it's **Somewhat Verifiable** (label 3).\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is clear about pointing out the ad-hoc nature and suggesting alternatives. It provides some guidance, though it's not entirely comprehensive. It's helpful but could be expanded. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful** (label 4).\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring that each label accurately reflects the quality of the review comment.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review points are:\na. Need to report average over multiple runs.\nb. Discuss decision boundaries in Sec. 3.1.\nc. Explain what's in Fig. 9.\n\nFor each of these, I need to check if they're explicit or implicit and if they're concrete. \n\na. \"Need to report average over multiple runs\" is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. It's concrete because it specifies the action clearly. So this is highly actionable.\n\nb. \"Discuss decision boundaries\" is also explicit. It tells the authors what to do without ambiguity. It's concrete because it's a clear instruction. So this is also highly actionable.\n\nc. \"Explain what's in Fig. 9\" is explicit again. It tells the authors exactly where to focus. It's concrete because it's a direct instruction. So this is highly actionable as well.\n\nSo all three points are explicit and concrete, making the actionability score 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. This looks at whether the review points clearly identify the specific parts of the paper.\n\na. \"Need to report average over multiple runs\" doesn't specify which part of the experimental section this refers to. It's a bit vague because it doesn't point to a specific section or figure. So the grounding is weak.\n\nb. \"Discuss decision boundaries in Sec. 3.1\" mentions the section, which is specific. It clearly points to Sec. 3.1, so this has good grounding.\n\nc. \"Explain what's in Fig. 9\" refers to a figure but doesn't specify which part of it. It's a bit vague because it doesn't point to a specific element within the figure. So grounding is weak.\n\nIn terms of specificity, a and c are vague because they don't specify exactly what part of the figure or section to focus on. Only b is specific about the section. So the grounding_specificity score is 3 because two of the points are weakly grounded.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. This assesses whether the claims are supported by evidence.\n\nLooking at each point:\na. \"Need to report average over multiple runs\" is a suggestion, not a claim. It doesn't require evidence to be verifiable.\n\nb. \"Discuss decision boundaries in Sec. 3.1\" is also a suggestion. It doesn't provide a claim that needs verification.\n\nc. \"Explain what's in Fig. 9\" is again a suggestion without a claim. It doesn't require evidence to be verified.\n\nSince none of the points are claims that need justification, the verifiability score is X, which is no claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. This is about how useful the review is to the authors.\n\na. \"Need to report average over multiple runs\" is helpful because it's a clear suggestion.\n\nb. \"Discuss decision boundaries in Sec. 3.1\" is helpful as it guides the authors to a specific section.\n\nc. \"Explain what's in Fig. 9\" is helpful because it directs the authors to a specific part of the figure.\n\nAll three points are helpful, but they could be more detailed. For example, specifying how to report the average or what aspects of the decision boundaries to discuss would make them more helpful. So the helpfulness score is 4 because they are clear but could be expanded.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 5\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: X\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I remember that it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The review mentions specific experiments and points out issues, so that's explicit. It also gives clear instructions on what to do, like using the same setup as DEN. That seems pretty actionable because the authors know exactly what to fix. So I think this is highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity** looks at how specific the comments are. The review points out the dataset (CIFAR) and mentions the comparison to DEN. It also suggests using the same setup, which ties directly to the paper's methods. This makes it fully grounded because it's not just a general critique but targets specific parts. So I'd give this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides clear justifications. It explains why the comparison isn't convincing and suggests a fairer comparison. It references existing literature, which adds credibility. So it's thoroughly supported, making it fully verifiable. I'll rate this a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness** is about how useful the review is. It addresses multiple points, provides clear suggestions, and references other work. This makes it very helpful because it guides the authors effectively. I think a 5 is appropriate here too.\n\nOverall, each aspect seems to be well addressed, so all scores are 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that O_up should contain offsets for every keypoint relative to the center and that Eq.2 in the supplementary material seems to train O_up to output offsets for keypoints not farther than a certain distance from the center. It then asks about how groundtruths are built and whether the network can predict all keypoints. \n\nThis seems like it's providing a specific action: checking the supplementary material for Eq.2. However, it doesn't give clear instructions on what exactly to do next. It's a bit vague because it's asking about groundtruths and whether the network can predict all keypoints, which doesn't directly guide the author on how to fix their model or data. So, while it's explicit, the action isn't very detailed. I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks concrete steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to O_up and Eq.2 in the supplementary material. It doesn't explicitly mention specific sections or parts of the paper, so the grounding is weak. It also doesn't clearly explain what's wrong or how to fix it, just poses questions. So, this is **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claims or suggestions. It's more of a question than a statement that needs verification. There's no logical reasoning or references provided, so it's **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking questions about the supplementary material and the network's ability to predict keypoints. While it provides some guidance, it's not very clear or actionable. It doesn't offer specific fixes or suggestions, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful** because it does address potential issues but lacks detailed guidance.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The comment says the figures are small and unreadable, doesn't explain how equation 5 follows from 4, and mentions theta^{t+1/2} and the definitions of S* and S~. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The first part about figures is explicit but vague\u2014how to make them bigger? The equation part is vague about the explanation. The theta part is also vague. So, it's not fully actionable because each point is too broad. Maybe it's a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to figures, equations, and specific parameters but doesn't mention sections or unique aspects. It's general but points to specific parts. So, it's fully grounded because it mentions specific elements, and it's specific because it details the issues with equations and definitions. So, that's a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment makes claims about figure size, equation derivation, theta's role, and definition issues. Each of these could be supported by common knowledge or references. For example, suggesting figures be larger is a common practice, so that's verifiable. The equation explanation might need more detail but is still verifiable. Theta's role is a standard concept, and definitions are well-known. So, it's mostly verifiable with minor gaps, maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment points out several issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, though not exhaustive. So, it's highly helpful because it's clear and constructive, even if it could be more comprehensive. So, a 5.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, actionability was 3, but I thought it might be 4 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail. Maybe I should reconsider. The comment does give specific areas for improvement, so it's somewhat actionable but not fully. So, 3 seems right.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 4, and helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests making the text in legends and axis labels larger. It also mentions that Proposition (1) should be Proposition 1, pointing out confusion with Equation 1. Additionally, it advises to adjust captions and legend font size similar to the text in Figures 2 and 3. \n\nLooking at the explicitness, the reviewer is clear about the actions needed, like increasing font sizes and renaming Propositions. That's explicit. Now, for concreteness, the reviewer specifies exactly what to do, like mentioning the font size and the similarity to text in other figures. So, it's not vague. \n\nI think this is **Explicit and Concrete**, so it should be a higher score. But the scale goes up to 5, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about legends, axis labels, captions, and font sizes. They mention specific parts of the paper, like Figures 2 and 3, which is good. However, the suggestions are quite general\u2014like making the text larger without specifying why or how it affects the paper. They also mention Propositions but don't tie it directly to a specific part beyond Equation 1, which is a bit vague. \n\nSo, the grounding is solid because they point to specific sections, but the specificity in detailing what needs fixing is a bit lacking. It's not the weakest grounding but not the strongest either. I think this might be a **Weakly Grounded and Specific** or maybe **Fully Grounded and Under-Specific**. Looking at the scale, I'll go with **3** because it's grounded but not fully specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about font size and renaming Propositions. But there's no justification or references provided. They just state what needs to be done without explaining why or how it's beneficial. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. This should be an **X** since there's no claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides clear suggestions about font sizes and renaming Propositions. They do a good job pointing out specific areas for improvement. However, the suggestions are somewhat generic and don't delve into the implications or how these changes will affect the overall paper. While helpful, it's not the most detailed feedback. So, a **3** seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect the explicitness, grounding, lack of justification, and partial helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing counterfactual experiments with Journey TRAK, specifically mentioning Figure 2 from [1]. It's explicit about the action, which is to compare, but it's vague on how to implement it. They don't specify the exact step in the sampling trajectory or how to analyze the results. So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the details are missing. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figure 2 from [1], which is specific. It clearly points to a particular part of the paper, so the grounding is strong. Additionally, it specifies what needs to be addressed, which is a comparison. That makes it **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests a specific comparison and references an external figure. This provides clear justification and examples, so it's well-supported. It's **4: Mostly Verifiable** because while it's thorough, it could be more detailed, but it's still solid.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the suggestion and references an external source, which is helpful. It provides a specific direction but doesn't go into implementation details. It's somewhat helpful but could be more comprehensive. So, it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that theoretical discussions need improvement and lists specific areas like sample complexity-type results. It also provides some reasoning about mutual information and DP. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what needs to be done. The reasoning is clear, so it's not vague. Therefore, it should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to theoretical discussions and mentions specific theorems related to mutual information and DP. It also suggests looking into sample complexity, which is a specific part of the paper. The mention is explicit and points to particular sections, so this is fully grounded and specific. That's another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides some reasoning about mutual information and DP, which are well-known concepts. It also suggests looking into sample complexity, which is a standard area in theoretical computer science. The references are logical and common knowledge, so this is fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and points out specific areas for improvement. It suggests looking into particular results and provides some context, which is helpful for the authors. While it's not the most detailed, it's still quite useful. So, I'll rate this as 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be a bit more comprehensive.\n\nOverall, the review is quite thorough and provides clear guidance, making it highly actionable, grounded, and verifiable, while it's mostly helpful in terms of providing meaningful feedback.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review point mentions that the author has doubts about the definitions in Table 1 and questions the differences between anchor-based regression and RepPoints regression. It suggests that the method regressing [w, h] to the center point is sufficient, while RepPoints regresses distance to feature maps. The reviewer ends by asking the author to clarify this. \n\nThis is explicit because the reviewer directly states the issue and asks for clarification. However, the action to take is vague. The author needs to explain the differences, but there's no specific guidance on how to do that. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear, but the implementation isn't specified.\n\n**Grounding Specificity:**\nThe reviewer refers to specific concepts like RepPoints, anchor-based regression, and RepPoints regression. They also mention RetinaNet's one-shot regression and cite literature (ATSS) that shows regression methods don't significantly differ. The mention of [w, h] and feature maps is explicit and specific. The reviewer doesn't make broad generalizations, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe reviewer makes a claim that there's no obvious difference between the methods. They provide some reasoning, like the ATSS literature, and mention that regressing [w, h] is sufficient. However, the evidence is a bit vague. They reference literature but don't provide detailed explanations or specific examples. This makes the claim somewhat verifiable but not fully supported.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe reviewer raises specific concerns about the definitions and asks for clarification. They also provide some context by mentioning RetinaNet and citing literature. However, the feedback is somewhat generic and lacks depth. The author might not gain significant insights or actionable steps from this review.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests clarifying whether Fourier modes are reals or complex. That's a direct action, so it's explicit. The comment also gives a clear direction on how to implement it by specifying the clarification needed. So, it's both explicit and concrete. That should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Fourier modes as numbers and asks for clarification on their type. It doesn't refer to a specific section or table, but it's clear about what part needs addressing. So, it's grounded because it's making a clear reference to a specific concept. It's also specific about what needs to be clarified. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that Fourier modes can be either real or complex and suggests clarification. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's just a suggestion without backing it up with references or logical reasoning. So, it's not verifiable. I'll mark this as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific area for improvement and providing a clear suggestion. It's actionable and directly helps the authors by guiding them on what to clarify. This is very helpful, so a 5 makes sense here.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. The review is clear, specific, and helpful, but it's not verifiable because it lacks supporting evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says, \"On line 205, it should be Fig. 1 instead of Fig. 5.1. In latex, please put '\\label' after the '\\caption', and the bug will be solved.\" \n\nFirst, I check if it's explicit or implicit. The comment directly tells the author what to change, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It tells them exactly which figure to use (Fig. 1) and how to fix it by moving the label after the caption. That seems very specific, so it's concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment points out a specific issue with a figure reference. It mentions Fig. 1 and the LaTeX command, so it's clearly addressing a specific part of the paper. The grounding is strong because it's not vague and directly references a part of the paper. The specificity is also good because it explains exactly what needs to be done. So this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the author should move the label in LaTeX. It's not a claim that needs evidence because it's a straightforward instruction. So there's no verifiability needed here. It's more of a directive than a claim, so it's not verifiable. Therefore, this should be a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear and directly points out the issue and how to fix it. It provides actionable steps without being too vague. While it's not the most detailed, it's still very helpful. So this should be a 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be a bit more comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The result comparison of 'Iteratively greedy Search' versus 'random search' on the model structure should be supplemented.\" I'm trying to see if this is explicit or implicit. It mentions the comparison and suggests supplementing it, which is a clear action. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It says \"should be supplemented,\" which is a bit vague. They might not know exactly how to supplement it, like whether they need to add more experiments or what kind. So, it's not fully explicit because the action isn't fully detailed. Therefore, it's probably **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about supplementing the result comparison but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be added. It's too vague. So, the authors can't confidently identify the specific part being addressed, which means it's not fully grounded. It's also not specific because it doesn't detail what's missing. So, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not grounded at all, but it's trying to be specific by mentioning the comparison.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the result comparison should be supplemented. But there's no justification or support provided. It's just a suggestion without any reasoning or references. So, it's not verifiable. It falls into **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment suggests supplementing the comparison but doesn't provide any specific details or reasoning why that's necessary. It's vague and doesn't give the authors a clear direction. So, it's **2: Barely Helpful** because it does offer a suggestion but lacks clarity and depth.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a reference next to baseline names in tables and clarifies that \u03a9 isn't explicitly defined but is easy to infer. Explicitly telling authors what to do is explicit actionability. Also, providing clear instructions on where to add a reference and defining \u03a9 as an inferred action makes this highly actionable. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions adding a reference next to specific table names and explains \u03a9 by analogy. It clearly points to the sections being discussed, so it's fully grounded. Also, explaining \u03a9 by analogy makes it specific. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review offers practical advice on where to add a reference and defines \u03a9 with a simple explanation. While it's clear, it doesn't cite external sources or provide deeper reasoning, so it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and gives specific instructions, which is helpful. It guides the authors on formatting and clarifying a term, which is useful. It's not the most detailed but is sufficient, so I'd rate it a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the caption for Figure 7 is incorrect and should be \"Edge Dynamics\" instead of \"Node Dynamics\". This is pretty explicit, so it's an explicit action. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly which part to change and what to change it to. There's no ambiguity here, so it's definitely actionable. Therefore, this should be a high score, probably 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions that the caption is incorrect and specifies the correct term. It doesn't leave any room for guessing. The authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is without any confusion. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That would also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is pointing out a factual error in the caption. It doesn't provide any reasoning or references to back up why the caption is incorrect or why \"Edge Dynamics\" is the right term. It's just stating the problem without justification. So, this is unverifiable, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and tells the authors exactly what to do. It's specific and actionable, which is great for the authors. However, it doesn't offer any additional suggestions or context beyond fixing the caption. While it's helpful, it's not the most comprehensive feedback. So, a 4 seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests adding case studies and error studies. It mentions that the paper lacks them, which is good, but it doesn't explicitly tell the authors exactly what to do. They know they need case studies, but it's not clear how to implement them. So, it's not fully actionable because the action is implicit. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review points out that the paper doesn't mention case studies and gives an example from another paper. It clearly identifies the part of the paper (the proposed component) and explains why case studies are needed. The specificity is high because it not only mentions the issue but also provides an example. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that adding case studies would make the argument more convincing. It supports this by mentioning the example of another paper. The reasoning is clear, and the reference is specific. This makes the claim thoroughly supported, so it's a 5 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is informative, pointing out a weakness and suggesting improvements. It provides a specific example, which is helpful. However, it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the highest. I'd rate this a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 5, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the standard deviation isn't provided and that the improvement from SoRA is limited due to random fluctuations. It suggests the author clarify which effects are within the SD range and which are improvements. The action here is clear: clarify the effects. It's explicit, so that's good. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells the author exactly what to do. There's no ambiguity. So, it's not vague. Therefore, this should be a high score for actionability. The scale goes from 1 to 5, with 5 being highly actionable. Since it's explicit and concrete, I think it's a 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out an issue in the experimental section but doesn't specify which part. It just says the standard deviation isn't provided. Without more details, the authors might not know exactly where to focus their improvements. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. The comment is general, so it's not fully grounded. Therefore, grounding_specificity should be a lower score. Looking at the scale, 3 is weak grounding and specific, which fits because it's specific about the issue but not the part of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the improvement is limited due to random fluctuations. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support this claim. It's vague and lacks justification. So, it's not fully verifiable. On the scale, 3 is somewhat verifiable, which seems appropriate here because it does make a claim but doesn't back it up sufficiently.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers suggestions but doesn't go into detail about how to clarify the effects or what specific data to look for. It's clear about the issues but lacks depth in guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most helpful. A score of 4 seems right because it's helpful but could be expanded for more detailed advice.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I remember that it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment points out two issues: replacing \"known\" with \"know\" and defining \\gamma_0^{***}. It also mentions the figure caption. For actionability, I need to check if these are explicit and if the actions are clear.\n\nThe first part, \"known, instead of know,\" is a direct suggestion, so that's explicit. The second part, \"please define \\gamma_0^{***},\" is also explicit. The third part, \"Figure 1: Please specify the meaning of the colors in the caption as well as the text,\" is another explicit instruction. So, all the actions are clear and direct. Now, are they concrete? Yes, because they specify exactly what needs to be done. So, this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. This is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper's parts. The comment talks about \"known\" vs. \"know,\" which is a general term, but it's about a specific part of the text. Then, it asks to define a specific symbol, \\gamma_0^{***}, which is a specific element in the paper. Lastly, it refers to Figure 1, which is a specific part of the paper. So, all references are specific, and the comment clearly states what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this should also be a high score, probably 5.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. This aspect checks if the comment is supported by evidence. The comment doesn't provide any justification or references for why \"known\" should be changed to \"know,\" defining \\gamma_0^{***}, or explaining the figure colors. It's just asking for these changes without any backing. So, there's no claim here, which means it's an \"X\" for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment provides specific suggestions but doesn't explain why these changes are necessary or how they improve the paper. It's clear and actionable, but lacks depth or justification. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Therefore, a score of 4 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be actionability: 5, grounding_specificity: 5, verifiability: X, and helpfulness: 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The proposed method consists of two major components: generative shape model and the word parsing model. It is unclear which component contributes to the performance gain. Since the proposed approach follows detection-parsing paradigm, it is better to evaluate on baseline detection or parsing techniques separately to better support the claim.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n**Actionability (3):**\n- The review explicitly states that it is unclear which component contributes to the performance gain. However, it does not provide concrete guidance on how to address this issue. The suggestion to evaluate baseline techniques separately is implicit and requires the authors to infer the necessary action.\n\n**Grounding Specificity (5):**\n- The comment explicitly mentions the two components (generative shape model and word parsing model) and clearly states the recommendation to evaluate baseline techniques separately. This provides full grounding as the referenced parts are accurately identified, and the specificity is clear regarding the recommendation.\n\n**Verifiability (3):**\n- The comment contains a claim that the performance gain is unclear and suggests evaluating baseline techniques. The suggestion is supported by logical reasoning about the detection-parsing paradigm but lacks specific references or examples. There is no external evidence provided, so it is somewhat verifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness (3):**\n- The review provides a clear suggestion to improve the analysis but does not elaborate on how to evaluate the baseline techniques.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"It is not clear how the method behaves without Lipschitz Hessian assumption.\" The user is pointing out a lack of clarity about the method's behavior under a specific condition. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit or implicit and if it's concrete.\n\nThe comment mentions that the method's behavior isn't clear without the assumption, which is an explicit statement. However, it doesn't provide any specific action or guidance on what the authors should do next. It's more of a statement of a problem rather than a suggestion on how to fix it. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. That would fall under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it's not fully actionable but not completely unactionable either.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to the Lipschitz Hessian assumption, which is a specific part of the method. It's clear which part is being addressed, so the grounding is strong. But the comment doesn't specify what needs to be done about it. It just states the issue without suggesting a fix. So, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific\" because the part is identified, but the action isn't detailed.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the method's behavior isn't clear without the assumption. There's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's just a statement without backing, so it's \"Unverifiable.\"\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a problem but doesn't offer any solutions or guidance on how to address it. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve their work beyond identifying an issue. So, it's \"Not Helpful at All.\"\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking about the rationale behind two modules in a figure. It's a bit vague because it's asking \"what are the main rationals for\" without providing specific suggestions or actions. The user is just inquiring about reasons, not giving clear instructions on how to improve something. So, it's not actionable because the reviewer isn't telling the authors what to do or how to fix it. It's more of a question than a directive, so I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points to Figure 1 and specifically mentions the outputs of the content encoder and timbre encoder. It's pretty specific about which parts of the paper it's referring to, so the grounding is strong. Additionally, it's clear about what it's asking regarding those outputs, so the specificity is also high. Therefore, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making claims about why certain modules are used. However, it's not providing any supporting evidence or reasoning. It's just stating what the rationale is without backing it up. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. I'll give this a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking questions rather than providing constructive feedback. It doesn't offer any suggestions or explanations, just inquires about reasons. Since it's not actively helping the authors improve, it's only somewhat helpful but not fully. So, I'll rate this as 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Table 4 is incomplete. It should include the results for all four datasets.\" This is pretty explicit. It tells the authors exactly what's missing and what they need to do. There's no ambiguity here. The action is clear\u2014add the missing results. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"Table 4\" and specifies \"all four datasets.\" That's pretty specific. The authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is and what needs to be added. There's no guesswork involved. So, this should be fully grounded and specific. Another 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a bit vague. It says the table is incomplete but doesn't explain why it's incomplete or how to fix it beyond adding the results. There's no justification or references provided. So, it's not really verifiable. Maybe a 1 because it lacks support.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out the problem and suggests a fix, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, so it's mostly helpful. It doesn't go beyond that, but it's enough to guide the authors. So, a 4 seems right.\n\nI think that's all.

However, the assumption that PCC is a more relaxed constraint compared with KL divergence because of its invariance to scale and shift is not convincing enough. The constraint strength of a loss function is defined via its gradient distribution. For example, KL divergence and MSE loss have the same optimal solution while MSE loss is stricter than KL because of stricter punishment according to its gradient distribution. From this perspective, it is necessary to provide the gradient comparison between KL and PCC.\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that PCC is a more relaxed constraint than KL divergence because of invariance to scale and shift. It then explains that constraint strength is defined by gradient distribution, giving examples like KL and MSE. It suggests comparing gradients between KL and PCC. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors exactly what to do: compare the gradients. So that's explicit. Is it concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly how to do it by referencing the gradient distribution. So it's both explicit and concrete. Therefore, it should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to PCC, KL divergence, and MSE loss. It mentions their properties like invariance and gradient distribution. It doesn't explicitly name sections or tables, but it's clear which metrics are being discussed. So the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the relevant metrics. The specificity is also good because it explains the properties and the reason for the comparison. So this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that PCC is a relaxed constraint compared to KL. It supports this by explaining constraint strength through gradient distribution and providing examples. The reasoning is logical, and the references are clear, even though it's a bit technical. So it's somewhat verifiable but not fully robust. Maybe a 3? Wait, no, the reasoning is solid, so maybe it's 4. Hmm, but the examples are a bit limited. Maybe 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a specific issue with PCC and suggests a method to evaluate it. It's clear and provides actionable steps. It's not just pointing out a problem but also giving a way to improve. So it's quite helpful. Maybe a 4.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, the reasoning is good but maybe not fully robust. So perhaps 3. But I'm not sure. Maybe 4 because the reasoning is logical and the examples are relevant. I'll stick with 3 for verifiability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The comment is explicit about the issue and provides a clear direction for the authors to elaborate. However, it doesn't give specific steps on how to explain it, so it's somewhat actionable. I think this should be a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer points out a specific concern about the transformer's no-locality bias. They also suggest the authors explain why this isn't a problem. The mention of \"no-locality won't make a concern here\" is clear and specific, so the grounding is strong. But the suggestion is a bit vague on how to explain it. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the no-locality isn't a concern, but they don't support it with evidence or references. They just provide a reasoning based on limited speed of information propagation. This isn't very verifiable because there's no external source or logical backing provided. So, I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer's points are clear and directly address the authors' concerns. They suggest explaining why no-locality isn't an issue, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are somewhat vague and don't provide detailed guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the highest. I'll give this a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated a 3 because they're clear but lack some depth or specificity.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Some figures are not self-explanatory. For instance, in Figure 4, the line of No adapt or Finetune are covered by other lines, without additional explanation.\" It explicitly mentions that the figures aren't self-explanatory and gives an example of Figure 4. That seems like a clear action, so it's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It suggests improving the figures but doesn't specify how. So, it's somewhat actionable because it's explicit but vague on the implementation. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review points out that Figure 4's lines are covered by others but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper this refers to. It mentions Figure 4 but doesn't pin down the exact section or element. So, the grounding is weak because it's not specific about the part being addressed. However, it does identify the issue, so it's not completely weak. I think this is a 3 because it's weakly grounded but provides some specificity by mentioning the figure.\n\nFor verifiability, the review makes a claim that the figures aren't self-explanatory and provides an example. The example explains why Figure 4 is problematic. This is logical reasoning and specific, so it's verifiable. It doesn't rely on external references, but it's clear and logical. So, I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but could be more robust.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a clear issue with figures and provides an example. It suggests improvements but doesn't go into depth. It's helpful because it identifies areas for improvement, but it's somewhat vague. So, it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated as 3 because they either have some issues or could be improved but aren't fully meeting the criteria for higher scores.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests providing a mathematical characterization instead of just mentioning the approximation error. That sounds like a clear action, so it's explicit. Also, it gives a concrete direction on how to implement the change. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the approximation error being ambiguous unless one sees the table. It mentions providing a mathematical characterization, which is specific. It doesn't just say \"improve the paper,\" it gives a precise method. So, this is fully grounded and specific. I'll also give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests a mathematical approach but doesn't provide any evidence or references. It just recommends a change. There's no justification or examples, so it's not very verifiable. I think a 3 is appropriate here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and points out a specific area for improvement. It helps the author know exactly what to do, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'll rate it a 4.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the model produces only 1 node changing cluster per time step because of the reassignment probability being 1/n. It also says the model is simplistic because only edges with 1 node changing are altered. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. \n\nThe review does state what the issue is, but it doesn't tell the authors how to fix it. It just points out the limitations without providing actionable steps. So, it's explicit about the problem but lacks guidance on how to address it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but not concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in pointing out the part of the paper. The review mentions the reassignment probability and the edges being altered, which are specific technical details. It doesn't make any general claims or guess where the issue is. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the sections being discussed. The specificity is good because it clearly states what's wrong without needing more context. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the model is too simplistic. It supports this by explaining why: the reassignment probability and the edges being limited. This explanation is logical and provides clear reasoning, so it's thoroughly supported. Therefore, it's **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out specific issues but doesn't offer any suggestions on how to improve the model. It just states the problems without providing solutions. While it's helpful in identifying weaknesses, it doesn't help the authors move forward. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it's clear about the problems but lacks constructive suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The technical contribution is limited, i.e., there is no significant technical contribution and extension based on a typical model for the cross-domain recommendation setting.\" Hmm, the reviewer is pointing out that the technical contribution is limited. They mention that there's no significant technical contribution and that it's an extension based on a typical model. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to see if this comment gives explicit or implicit actions. The reviewer is stating a fact, but they don't suggest any specific changes or improvements. They just point out the limitation. So, it's more of an implicit statement. Since the reviewer isn't telling the authors what to do, it's not actionable. Therefore, this should be labeled as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the comment is. The reviewer says the technical contribution is limited, but they don't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is lacking. They're making a general statement, so the grounding is weak. They aren't pinning down the specific section or issue. So, this should also be a 1 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim because it's making a judgment about the paper's technical contribution. Now, is this claim supported? The reviewer is stating that the contribution is limited, which is a subjective opinion. There's no evidence or references provided to back this up. It's just a general statement without justification. So, this is unverifiable. Therefore, verifiability gets a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a limitation but doesn't provide specific suggestions or improvements. It's a negative statement without offering actionable steps. Since the authors don't know what exactly to fix or how to improve, the comment isn't very helpful. It's more of a criticism without constructive advice. So, helpfulness should be a 1.\n\nPutting it all together, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because the review point doesn't provide actionable feedback, lacks specific grounding, isn't supported by evidence, and doesn't offer helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The authors do not give a comprehensive discussion of previous work on this topic.\" I think this is an implicit action because it's not explicitly telling the authors what to do. It's more of a statement that they need to improve. So, it's not giving a direct action, which would have been something like \"Add a discussion of previous work.\" Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it's implied but vague on how to proceed.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"previous work,\" but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or how that relates to the current work. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the discussion is lacking. That means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the issue.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a judgment that the authors didn't discuss previous work comprehensively. But there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's just a statement without backing, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem but doesn't offer any suggestions on how to improve it. It's just pointing out the lack of discussion without providing actionable steps. So, it's barely helpful because it identifies an issue but doesn't help the authors fix it.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review points out several areas for the authors to consider, like the OT sample selection process, whether it runs once or iteratively, and the flow of training steps. It also asks for more details, a flowchart, and specific runtimes. These are all explicit actions the authors can take. The review doesn't just suggest something; it clearly states what needs to be done. Moreover, it provides concrete details about what information they should include. So, this is highly actionable because the authors know exactly what steps to follow and what information to add. I'd give this a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific sections of the paper, like section 2.4.3 and equation (3). It also asks for a flowchart and runtimes, which are specific parts. The authors can pinpoint exactly where to add this information. This means the review is fully grounded because it clearly references specific parts of the paper, and it's specific about what needs to be addressed. So, this also gets a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting improvements and providing some justification, like explaining why more details and a flowchart would help readers. However, the justification is a bit vague. It mentions specific things like runtimes but doesn't provide concrete references or examples. While it's somewhat justified, there's room for more robust backing. So, I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does a good job pointing out areas for improvement and asking for specific details. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful. However, it could be more detailed, like providing examples of what kind of flowchart or mentioning how the runtimes were measured. Without more specifics, while it's helpful, it's not the most comprehensive. So, a 4 seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"A human evaluation for caption generation would be more convincing as the automatic evaluation metrics can be misleading.\" The definition for actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what needs to be done. \n\nLooking at this comment, it suggests that human evaluation is better but doesn't specify how to implement this change. It doesn't tell the authors what exactly they should do, like adding more human reviewers or changing their evaluation process. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an opinion rather than a clear action. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is in addressing a part of the paper. The comment talks about caption generation but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where the issue lies. It's a general suggestion without pinpointing the exact area. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the specific section or issue. Hence, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim that human evaluation is more convincing. It's suggesting a change but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why automatic metrics are misleading. There's no reference to external studies or common knowledge supporting this claim. It's just an opinion without backing, so it's not verifiable. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a potential improvement (using human evaluation) but doesn't provide specific advice on how to implement it. It's vague and doesn't give detailed suggestions. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully constructive. Therefore, helpfulness is 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the paper's objective is good but lacks motivation and uses static datasets. It suggests the problem needs better motivation. The action here is clear: motivate the applications and improve the datasets. It's explicit, so that's good. But the review doesn't tell the authors exactly how to do this, like specific steps or examples. So it's explicit but vague. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the objective but doesn't specify which part of the paper needs improvement. It talks about motivation and datasets but doesn't point to exact sections or unique aspects. It's a bit vague, so it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does imply but doesn't clearly identify the sections.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that the problem needs motivation and that static datasets are used. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support these claims. It's just an opinion without backing, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some justification but lacks key elements.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issues but doesn't offer specific suggestions on how to improve. It's pointing out problems without actionable steps.

I think the explicit action here is pointing out the need for a native review and rewriting. But is this action clear? It tells the authors what to do, but it doesn't specify how to rewrite or what exactly needs to be rewritten. So, it's more of an implicit action. That would probably be a 2 because it's borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the GAT being trained but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this refers to. It also mentions needing a native review and rewriting, which is quite vague. There's no specific section or element of the paper addressed, so the grounding is weak. It's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the issue. So, I'd give this a 3, which is weakly grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the GAT needs a native review and rewriting. But there's no justification or evidence provided for why this is necessary. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out areas for improvement but doesn't provide much detail.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is quite detailed, pointing out several issues like unclear techniques, lack of detail in sparsification, and questions about landmark extraction, number of landmarks, feature types, etc. It seems like it's giving clear instructions on what the authors need to do. The comment is explicit about the problems and provides specific areas for improvement. Even though it's a lot, it's not vague. So, I think this is highly actionable because the authors can directly apply these suggestions. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific areas like the sparsification process, landmark extraction, number of landmarks, feature types, and questions about shape invariance. It's not just a general critique but points to exact parts of the paper. The comment is quite specific about what needs fixing. It doesn't just say \"the paper needs improvement,\" but it pinpoints the exact sections and issues. So, this should be fully grounded and specific. That's another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making claims about the lack of detail and the need for specific processes. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just states the issues without backing them up. So, while it's a valid claim, there's no justification or examples given. This means it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the depth needed for full verifiability. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is quite comprehensive, listing multiple specific areas for improvement. It guides the authors on what to do without being overly vague. The suggestions are clear and actionable, which is great for helping the authors improve their work. Even though it's a bit lengthy, it's thorough and useful. So, this should be highly helpful, giving it a 5.\n\nOverall, the review point is detailed and provides clear guidance, making it highly actionable, grounded, somewhat verifiable, and highly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding error bars and more random trials to Figure 1. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. The comment also gives a direct instruction on how to implement it by mentioning the specifics like error bars and random trials. Since it's both explicit and concrete, it should be highly actionable. So, I think the actionability label is 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Figure 1 and mentions specific elements like error bars and random trials. It doesn't just say \"improve Figure 1\" but pinpoints exactly what to add. This makes it fully grounded and specific. So, grounding_specificity is 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that adding these elements would reduce random fluctuations. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this claim. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does suggest specific changes, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague about how these changes will definitely reduce fluctuations. It could be more detailed, but it's still providing some guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful, which is a 4.\n\nI think that's all. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and I don't see any borderline cases here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review suggests adding an introduction to energy models in the Related Work section and clarifying the correspondence in Figure 1. The first part is explicit\u2014adding an introduction. However, the second part about the figure is vague. It mentions that the different points correspond to learning rates and steps but doesn't specify how. So, while the action is clear, the details are missing, making it somewhat actionable.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe review mentions the Related Work section and Figure 1 but doesn't specify which part of the paper these refer to. It's unclear, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't point to a specific section or figure, which means the authors can't pinpoint where to make changes, making it weakly grounded.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe review contains two claims: suggesting an introduction and clarifying the figure. The introduction is a general suggestion without evidence. The figure clarification is vague, lacking specific references or reasoning. Both are unverifiable because there's no supporting evidence.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review offers two suggestions but lacks clarity and specificity. The introduction idea is good but not detailed, and the figure explanation is too vague. Overall, it's somewhat helpful as it points out areas for improvement, but it's not very detailed.\n\nSo, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding_specificity: 1 (Not Grounded)\n- Verifiability: 3 (Somewhat Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that FIITED uses a utility-based approach but suggests that relying solely on utility scores might introduce biases. It gives an example about recent chunks having temporary high utility leading to premature evictions. This seems like a clear action or suggestion for the authors to consider alternative eviction strategies. So, it's explicit and gives a direction. But does it tell them exactly how to implement it? Not really, just suggests a change. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but vague on the implementation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to FIITED's approach by name, which is specific. It also mentions \"chunks\" and \"eviction decisions,\" which are specific parts of the paper. The comment doesn't make broad claims or vague references. It clearly points to specific elements of the paper, so this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that using only utility scores could introduce biases. It provides an example about recent chunks having high utility. However, it doesn't explain why this introduces bias or provide evidence or references. It's a bit vague in supporting its claim, so I'd rate this as **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's a claim with some justification but not enough detail.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a clear critique of FIITED's approach and provides a specific example. It suggests an alternative but doesn't elaborate much on how to implement it. It's helpful in pointing out a potential issue but could be more detailed. So, I think this is **Mostly Helpful** because it's informative and constructive, though not entirely comprehensive.\n\nI should double-check each aspect to make sure I didn't miss anything. Actionability seems clear, grounding is specific, verifiability is somewhat justified, and helpfulness is mostly so. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using styles like dashed lines or adding color to distinguish the curves. That's a clear action the authors can take. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. Also, it's concrete because it specifies the methods to apply. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 2 and suggests specific methods to improve the distinguishability. It doesn't just say \"Figure 2 needs work\" but points out exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. So, it's fully grounded because it references the specific part of the paper and provides clear instructions on how to address it.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the figure is difficult to distinguish and suggests methods to improve it. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up these claims. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting data or logical reasoning provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a clear issue and provides actionable suggestions. It helps the authors by giving them specific steps to take. While it could be more detailed, it's still quite helpful. So, I'd rate it as mostly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect high actionability and grounding, low verifiability, and high helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors should tone down the introduction and not call it language learning. It suggests it's more of a feedback-driven QA dialog. This is explicit, so it's not implicit. But the action is vague\u2014how much to tone down? There's no specific guidance on what changes to make. So it's explicit but lacks detail, making it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the introduction and suggests a different approach. It doesn't specify which part of the introduction or what exactly to change. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does touch on the issue but doesn't clearly identify the part.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that the tasks are mismatched and suggests a different approach. There's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's a claim without justification, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some feedback but is vague and doesn't provide concrete suggestions. It tells the authors what to do but not how. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully, making it **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, considering explicitness, grounding, verifiability, and overall helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that kernels are implemented with OpenAI's Triton instead of CUDA, and mentions that a full-page explanation isn't necessary because the improvements are well-known. I think this is explicit because it directly states the implementation and the reason for not needing a full explanation. It doesn't ask the authors to infer anything, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly where to look and why a full explanation isn't needed. So, it's highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions OpenAI's Triton and the reason for not needing a full explanation. It doesn't specify which part of the paper this applies to, but it's clear that it's about the implementation details. So, it's fully grounded because it mentions the specific part (implementation details) and clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is not needing a full explanation. So, I'd rate this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that OpenAI's Triton is well-known and that a full-page explanation isn't necessary. The claim is supported by stating the reason (well-known engineering improvements), so it's verifiable. It's somewhat specific because it explains why a full explanation isn't needed, but it doesn't provide external references. So, it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear information about the implementation choice and the reason for not needing a full explanation. It's helpful because it guides the authors on where to look and why they don't need a detailed explanation. However, it could be more helpful if it suggested specific changes or improvements. So, it's mostly helpful, maybe a 4.\n\nI think that's a solid evaluation based on the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions several points, like the transferability being limited due to task difficulty and the manipulation scenario. It suggests that the paper needs to clarify the transferability between tasks. However, the suggestions are a bit vague. They don't specify exactly what needs to be done, like whether they should conduct experiments or provide more details. So, it's not entirely clear what actions the authors should take. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the source and target tasks, comparing their difficulties, and mentions the manipulation scenario with different rotation tasks. It seems like the authors can pinpoint the specific parts of the paper being discussed, like the tasks and their complexities. Additionally, it clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is the transferability between tasks. So, this is fully grounded and specific. I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims about the transferability being limited and the difficulty of transferring from simpler to complex tasks. It supports these claims by explaining why the tasks differ in difficulty and how the manipulation scenarios provide information. The reasoning is logical, and it references the nature of the tasks without needing external citations. So, it's thoroughly supported, making it fully verifiable. I'll rate this as 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues the authors need to address and provides clear suggestions. It doesn't seem vague or minimal; instead, it offers concrete feedback that would help the authors improve their work. The suggestions are actionable and address meaningful weaknesses. So, this is highly helpful. I'll give it a 5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For actionability, the review doesn't specify exact actions, so it's not fully explicit. That's why I gave it a 3. Everything else seems solid with 5s.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors haven't covered more on the types of activities in the datasets, especially from the perspective of occupant comfort and energy efficiency. It suggests they should \"explore more on the types of activities\" and \"consider the importance from the perspective of occupant comfort and energy efficiency.\" These are explicit actions, so it's not implicit. However, the suggestions are quite vague. They don't specify how to explore more or what exactly to consider. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"the types of activities captured in the datasets\" and \"from the perspective of occupant comfort and energy efficiency.\" It's clear which part of the paper it's addressing because it refers to the datasets and the specific aspects. Then, it specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the types of activities and their importance. So, it's both grounded and specific. That should be a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the authors should explore more on the types of activities and consider the importance from a specific perspective. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided. It's just a suggestion without any backing. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides a suggestion but it's quite vague. It doesn't give specific steps or examples on how to explore more or what to consider. So, while it's helpful, it's not very detailed. That makes it somewhat helpful but not fully. So, a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"D\" is used to represent both dimensionality of points and dilation factor. Better to use different notation to avoid confusion. I remember that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the comment is pointing out a specific issue with the notation, suggesting a better alternative. It's explicit about the problem and provides a clear solution, so that's good. It doesn't seem vague or unclear. So, I'd say this is highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to change and how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment again talks about \"D\" causing confusion. It doesn't mention any specific part of the paper, just the notation issue. There's no mention of a section or figure, so the grounding is weak. It's not pointing to a specific area, just a general suggestion. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be low, maybe a 1 because it's not grounded at all.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment suggests using different notation, but it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why \"D\" is problematic or why a different notation is better. It's just a suggestion without backing. So, there's no verifiable reasoning here. It's more of a recommendation without support, so verifiability would be unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does suggest a change, which is helpful. It points out a specific issue and provides a clear improvement. Even though it doesn't justify why \"D\" is problematic, it's still actionable and gives the authors a direction to follow. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I'd rate this a 4 because it's helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nWait, but for **actionability**, I initially thought it was 5 because it's explicit and clear. But maybe I should double-check. The comment is specific about the notation issue and suggests a solution. That's definitely actionable. So, 5 makes sense there.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, since it's not pointing to a specific part of the paper, it's weak grounding. So, 1 is correct.\n\n**Verifiability** is definitely 1 because there's no justification provided. It's just a suggestion without any backing.\n\n**Helpfulness** is 4 because it's clear and actionable but lacks justification, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So, 4 is appropriate.\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The comment is specific about the notation issue, suggests a solution, but doesn't provide reasons or evidence. So, actionability is high, grounding is low, verifiability is low, and helpfulness is good but not perfect.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done, like suggesting a modification or a detailed explanation. So, it's not explicit because it's vague about how to improve it. Therefore, it's somewhere between 2 and 3. Since it's vague, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to channel and spatial attention but doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs improvement. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. Maybe a 3 here because it's not fully specific but not completely vague either.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment talks about the innovative part needing detail but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a potential weakness in the method but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or details on how to improve it.

It's explicit about the action, but it's vague on how to implement it. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this is a 3.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the review refers to societal impact without pinning down exactly what part. It's a bit vague, so I'd rate this as 3.\n\n**Verifiability** is about whether the claim is supported. The reviewer is making a judgment about potential negative impacts but doesn't back it up with evidence or references. It's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth, so a 3 seems right.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer provides some suggestions but doesn't tie them to the authors' work or give clear guidance.

It doesn't specify what the correct notation should be or how to apply this change. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the notation being strange and elsewhere using \\hat for empirical estimates. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is wrong with the notation. So, it's only partially grounded, hence **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests that the notation is strange but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just an opinion without supporting evidence, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out an issue but doesn't suggest improvements or provide context.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the methods' applicability is limited because of strong assumptions about camera parameters. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They might need to consider relaxing those assumptions or collecting more data. So, it's not giving a direct action, which makes it borderline actionable. I think it's a 1 because it's not fully actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about camera parameters but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the methods are limited due to assumptions but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a claim without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't suggest how to improve or where to look for solutions. It's vague and doesn't offer actionable steps, so it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'd give it a 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a 1 or 3.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Perhaps something more should be done to convince the reader that a query of the type SEARCH is feasible in some realistic scenario.\" The first thing I notice is that it's giving a suggestion, but it's pretty vague. It doesn't specify what needs to be done or how to convince the reader. So, it's not an explicit action because it's not clear what the author should do. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which means the author has to infer what to do. Since it's vague, the author might not know exactly how to proceed. So, I think this is somewhere between \"Explicit vs. Implicit\" where it's implicit, and \"Concrete vs. Vague\" where it's vague. So, I'd rate it as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about convincing the reader that a certain query is feasible. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. It's too vague about the section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded since it's not pointing to a specific part. But it's also not completely ungrounded because it's making a general comment. So, I think this is a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review is making a claim by suggesting that a query is feasible. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to support the suggestion. Therefore, this should be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a potential improvement but doesn't specify what needs to be done or how to implement it. It's vague and doesn't give concrete suggestions. While it's somewhat helpful in pointing out an area for improvement, it's not very detailed or actionable. So, it's somewhat helpful but not highly so. I'd rate this as a 3 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It would help if the form of p was described somewhere near line 135. As per my above comment, I assume it is a Gaussian distribution, but it's not explicitly stated.\" \n\nFirst, is this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is suggesting where to describe the form of p, which is explicit. They're pointing out a specific location (near line 135) and also hinting that they think it's a Gaussian distribution, even though it's not stated. So, the action is to describe the form of p near line 135. \n\nIs the action concrete? Yes, because they specify the location. But is it vague on how to apply it? Well, they don't tell the author exactly how to describe it, just where. So, it's somewhat actionable because the author knows where to go, but not exactly what to write. So, I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"near line 135\" which is specific. They're pointing out a particular part of the paper, so that's full grounding. Then, they suggest it's a Gaussian distribution, which is specific. So, both grounding and specificity are met. Therefore, this should be a higher score. I think 3 is appropriate here because while they're specific, they could have provided more detail on what exactly to write.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The reviewer is making a claim that the form of p is a Gaussian distribution. Is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is suggesting it's Gaussian but isn't citing any references or logical reasoning. They just state their assumption. So, there's no justification or evidence provided to support this claim. Therefore, it's not fully verifiable. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific location where a description is needed and suggests it's a Gaussian distribution. While they're being helpful by pointing out the omission, they don't provide much detail. The author would still need to figure out what exactly to write. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated 3 because they're all somewhat actionable, grounded, verifiable, and helpful, but not fully so.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out a potential misunderstanding about the regret bound. It suggests that the method achieves T^{1/2} regret, which might imply that the prediction error over time isn't sublinear. But the comment doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. It just raises a question. So, it's not giving a clear action, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the regret bound and the prediction error over the entire horizon T. It's pretty specific about what part of the paper it's talking about. It doesn't just say \"the paper\" but mentions the regret and the time horizon. So, this is fully grounded because it clearly points to the specific section or part of the paper. I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the regret can't be sublinear, but it doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states an opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's not very verifiable. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks key elements like examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment raises a valid point about the regret bound and encourages the authors to consider the implications. It's clear and actionable in that sense, but it doesn't go into detail about what steps the authors should take. It's helpful but could be expanded. So, a 4 seems right because it's mostly helpful with some room for improvement.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the authors should discuss the balance between locality in the image space and the graph structure. It doesn't specify exactly what changes to make or how to implement that discussion. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for a discussion but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions table 3 for visualizations but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is.

However, it does clearly identify the issue, so it's **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides some examples like table 3 and mentions image size dependency, which are verifiable points. It doesn't cite external references, but the examples are clear, so it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out areas for improvement and suggests specific issues like the need for a discussion. It's actionable enough to be helpful, so it gets a **4**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, making sure to follow the guidelines and consider borderline cases where necessary.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I remember that it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The review mentions that the results have exponential dependence on the diameter M, which is a weakness. It also suggests that the authors should consider alternative approaches. That seems pretty explicit. The comment gives a clear action: pointing out the exponential dependence and suggesting alternatives. It doesn't just imply something; it actually states it. Also, it tells the authors exactly what to do, which is good. So, I think this is highly actionable because it's explicit and concrete. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. This is about how specific the review is in pointing out the part of the paper. The review talks about Corollaries 1, 2, 3, and Theorem 4, which are specific results. It also mentions Figure 1, which is a specific part of the paper. Additionally, it suggests considering alternative approaches, which is a bit more general but still points to the theoretical results. The grounding here is pretty solid because it references specific sections and figures, making it clear which parts are being discussed. So, I'd rate this as 5 as well.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The review makes a claim that the exponential dependence is a weakness and suggests alternative approaches. It provides some reasoning about how this affects the constant factor and the performance shown in Figure 1. However, the explanation is a bit vague. It mentions that the performance gets worse quickly but doesn't provide specific references or examples beyond Figure 1. It also doesn't cite any external literature or well-known practices, so the justification isn't fully robust. Therefore, while it's somewhat verifiable, it's not fully justified, so I'd give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review points out specific weaknesses and suggests improvements, which is helpful. It tells the authors what to focus on and what alternatives to consider. However, it doesn't go into much detail about how to implement these suggestions or provide concrete examples. It's clear and actionable, but maybe a bit too brief. So, it's mostly helpful but could be expanded a bit more. I'd rate this a 4.\n\nOverall, the review is quite good in terms of pointing out issues and suggesting improvements, but it could be more detailed to fully meet the criteria for higher scores in some aspects.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that DGNs have poor long-range modeling ability due to oversquashing and gradient issues. It also points out that poor performance could be due to oversmoothing, referencing another study. Now, does this give the authors clear instructions on what to do next? It suggests looking into other phenomena, but it doesn't specify how to apply this feedback or what changes to make. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an observation without actionable steps. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it does hint at something but isn't clear on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to oversquashing, vanishing/exploding gradients, and oversmoothing. It also cites a specific paper. So, the authors can identify the specific part of the paper being discussed, which is good. Additionally, it explains what each term means, so it's clear what's being addressed. This seems to have both grounding and specificity, but maybe it's only weakly grounded because it's a bit abstract. However, since it's accurately pinpointing the issue, I'll go with fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions specific phenomena and cites a paper. It provides some justification by referencing existing literature, which helps the authors understand why the issue might be present. However, it doesn't go into depth about how these phenomena affect the model or how to mitigate them. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's some support but not enough to fully convince or guide the authors on the next steps.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some insights by pointing out another factor contributing to the problem. It does suggest looking into other phenomena, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide detailed guidance on what changes to make or how to implement fixes. It's somewhat helpful because it adds another perspective but doesn't comprehensively address the authors' needs for improvement.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the provided review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing the proposed method with existing ones like generalized Voronoi graphs, semantic maps, pose graphs in SLAM, and curiosity-driven exploration. It also mentions discussing the method in the appendix. The comment is explicit about the actions the authors should take, like comparing and discussing. It doesn't just say \"compare,\" but gives specific examples, which makes it clear. The actions are concrete because it tells the authors exactly what to do. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific methods and sections like the graph-based SLAM appendix. This shows that the authors can pinpoint exactly where to add the discussion. It's not just a vague suggestion but targets a specific part of the paper. The specificity is high because it clearly states what needs to be addressed in that section.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests looking at existing literature and specific sections. It provides references like the appendix, which adds credibility. However, it doesn't go into detail about why these methods are relevant or how they apply to the proposed method. The justification is there but not extensive, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully robust.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the suggestions and provides specific references. It guides the authors on what to do without being too vague. The references are relevant and provide a basis for discussion. This makes the comment quite helpful because it gives actionable and grounded feedback.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect seems to be at a high level, especially actionability, grounding, and helpfulness. Verifiability is there but could be a bit more detailed. All scores should be 5 except maybe verifiability, which I'll rate as 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but not fully robust.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

It's more of an analysis rather than a clear action. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 or 4?\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the review does point out specific figures and references, like Fig1(b) and Fig5(b), and mentions other works.

Since it's specific and provides comparisons, I'll go with 5.\n\nWait, but for actionability, since it's more of an analysis without clear next steps, maybe it's a 3. But the other aspects are higher. I think the user wants the scores, so I'll assign 3 to actionability and 5 to the others.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review points at two specific lines, L384 and L431, and suggests changes. For L384, it says to mention that |Y_t - Y_{t-1}| \u2264 c_t almost surely. That seems like a clear instruction, so the action is explicit. Then, for L431, it suggests that \u03bc_t should be \\tilde{\u03bc}_t, yes? This is also a direct instruction, so the action is explicit here too. \n\nNow, looking at how concrete these actions are. For L384, the comment specifies exactly what needs to be mentioned, which is the inequality. It doesn't leave room for interpretation, so that's concrete. Similarly, for L431, it clearly states that \u03bc_t should be \\tilde{\u03bc}_t, which is precise. There's no vagueness here, so both actions are concrete. \n\nSince the actions are both explicit and concrete, the review is highly actionable. I don't see any implicit actions here, so it shouldn't be a lower score. Therefore, actionability is 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review points to specific lines in the code, L384 and L431. These are explicit references to particular parts of the paper, so the grounding is strong. The comment isn't making general statements; it's pinpointing exact lines. Additionally, it's clear what needs to be addressed in those lines\u2014specific modifications to the variables. \n\nSince the grounding is explicit and the specificity is clear, this review is fully grounded and specific. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 5.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review contains claims that suggest specific changes to the code. These claims are supported by logical reasoning. For example, mentioning that the inequality should be \u2264 c_t almost surely is a clear statement, and the suggestion to use \\tilde{\u03bc}_t is based on standard notation practices. There are no vague or insufficient justifications provided. The evidence is solid and logical, so the claims are thoroughly supported. Therefore, verifiability is 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review provides specific and actionable feedback on two lines of code. It clearly points out what needs to be changed and suggests the correct modifications. While it's concise, it doesn't leave much room for further elaboration, but it's still very helpful. It guides the authors directly on what to do without being overly vague. So, helpfulness is 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be slightly expanded for completeness.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 5, grounding_specificity: 5, verifiability: 5, and helpfulness: 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that Eq. 12 is confusing and asks where the reward comes from. It also suggests explaining the network model with equations. The action here is clear: the reviewer is pointing out a confusion and providing a solution. The solution is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. Additionally, the instructions are concrete because they specify exactly what needs to be done, like explaining the model with equations. So, this is highly actionable because it's both explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions Eq. 12 and suggests explaining Sec. 4.2 with equations. Eq. 12 is a specific part of the paper, and Sec. 4.2 is a specific section. The reviewer isn't just guessing; they're pointing to exact places. They also provide a clear suggestion about using equations, which is specific to those sections. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That's another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that the network model should be explained with equations. The justification is that it would improve clarity, which is a common-sense argument. They're not citing external references, but the reasoning is logical and clear. So, it's thoroughly supported, making it fully verifiable. I'll give this a 5 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer's comments are clear and directly address the confusion about the reward source and the need for clearer explanations. They provide actionable suggestions without being vague. This is very helpful because it guides the authors to improve their paper significantly. So, this should be a 5.\n\nOverall, all four aspects are highly scored because the review is explicit, specific, well-supported, and very helpful to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The comment says, \"3 Minor Issues: Ln 32 on Page 1, \u2018Empiically\u2019 should be \u2018Empirically\u2019.\" I remember from the definition that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the comment is pointing out a typo, which is a minor issue. It does explicitly state the action\u2014correcting the typo\u2014but it's very vague. It doesn't tell the author how to fix it, just that they should correct it. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on the implementation. I think this would be a 5 because it's explicit, but wait, no\u2014the typo correction is straightforward, so maybe it's more of a 4 because it's explicit but not very detailed on how to do it. Hmm, but the definition says explicit is good, so maybe 5. Wait, no, the typo is clear, so maybe 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper Ln 32 on Page 1 refers to. It just mentions a line number without pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the author can't pinpoint where the issue is. That means it's not grounded because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. So, grounding_specificity would be 1 because it's not grounded at all.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it suggests a correction. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the typo needs fixing. It's just pointing out the typo without supporting the claim. So, it's unverifiable. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a minor issue with a typo. It's clear and actionable in that it tells the author to fix it, but it's very minor. It doesn't provide much depth or guidance beyond fixing the typo. So, it's somewhat helpful but not highly so. Maybe a 4 because it's helpful but could be expanded.\n\nWait, but for actionability, I thought it was explicit but vague. The definition says explicit is good, so maybe it's a 5. But the comment doesn't specify how to fix the typo, just that it should be corrected. So, it's explicit but lacks detail. Maybe it's a 4 because it's explicit but not very detailed.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 5, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability 1, helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the novelty isn't enough and mentions both the new metric and method are straightforward. It doesn't specify what needs to be done, like suggesting changes or improvements. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't tell the authors how to fix it. That makes it somewhat actionable because they know there's a problem, but they don't know how to address it. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the novelty and the straightforwardness of the metric and method. It doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper or method. It's more general, so the authors might not know exactly where to focus their improvements. Therefore, it's weakly grounded because it doesn't pin down the issue precisely. But it does explain what's wrong, so it's somewhat specific. So, I'd rate this a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the novelty isn't enough and that the methods are straightforward. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up these claims. It's just a statement of opinion without supporting data. So, it's not very verifiable. Maybe a 3 here because it's somewhat clear but lacks the necessary justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out issues but doesn't offer concrete suggestions on how to improve. It tells the authors there's a problem but doesn't show them the path forward. This is somewhat helpful because they know there's a flaw, but without guidance, it's not fully helpful. So, a 3 here as well.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or specificity needed for full effectiveness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I remember that it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The review mentions that the proposed approach doesn't perform as well as Decouple and suggests improvements. It also points out a trade-off between head and tail categories and suggests that the baselines could be improved by adjusting hyper-parameters. This seems pretty explicit. The reviewer is giving clear actions like suggesting parameter tuning and pointing out specific areas for improvement. So, this should be highly actionable because the authors can directly implement these suggestions. I think this gets a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity** looks at whether the review refers to specific parts of the paper. The reviewer talks about Table 5 and mentions head and tail categories, which are specific sections. They also suggest looking into hyper-parameters, which is a specific recommendation. So, the review is well-grounded because it accurately points to the relevant parts and provides clear instructions. This also gets a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review needs to support its claims with evidence. The reviewer states that Decouple doesn't perform as well and suggests that adjusting hyper-parameters could improve tail accuracy. They don't provide specific references or examples, but the suggestions are logical and based on common knowledge in machine learning. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness** is about how useful the review is. The feedback is clear and points out specific weaknesses and improvements. However, it's a bit vague in suggesting hyper-parameter adjustments without more details. It could be more helpful if it provided specific examples or a clearer path forward. So, I'd rate this a 4.\n\nOverall, the review is quite good but could be slightly more detailed to be fully helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a comment about pi being a function and mentions dropping the no-op action. It also asks why not assume the first column is zero. This is explicit, so it's clear what the author should do. The action is concrete because it tells the author exactly where to add the comment and what to explain. So, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific parts of the code, like X pi(X), and mentions the dimensions not matching because of dropping the no-op action. It's clear which part is being referred to, so the grounding is full. It also explains what's wrong, which makes it specific. Therefore, this should be fully grounded and specific, scoring a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a logical explanation about the dimensions and why dropping the no-op action affects the first column. It uses common knowledge about matrix dimensions and the implications of dropping a column. However, it doesn't cite any external references, which is okay because it's based on clear reasoning. So, it's mostly verifiable, which is a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides actionable suggestions. It helps the author understand where to add comments and why the first column should be zero. While it doesn't go into more detail, it's sufficient for improvement. So, it's mostly helpful, scoring a 4.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. The review is explicit and concrete, fully grounded and specific, mostly supported by reasoning, and mostly helpful for the author.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The expected counterfactual violates $\\mathcal{P}_2$ stated in Definition 1.\" Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the aspect of actionability. The review mentions that the counterfactual violates a property, but it doesn't specify what needs to be done. It doesn't give an explicit action like \"remove this section\" or \"add a discussion.\" So, it's not explicit. It's more of a statement of a problem without suggesting a fix. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review refers to a specific part of the paper by mentioning $\\mathcal{P}_2$ and Definition 1. It's clear which part is being addressed because it's referencing a specific property. So, the grounding is solid. However, the specificity is about what exactly is wrong. The review says it violates $\\mathcal{P}_2$, which is a specific property, but it doesn't explain why it's a problem or how it affects the paper. So, while it's grounded, it's not very specific about the issue. Maybe it's a bit under-specific. But since it's grounded, I think it's better than not grounded. So, I'll give it a 2 for grounding specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The claim here is that the counterfactual violates $\\mathcal{P}_2$. The justification is that it's stated in Definition 1. However, the review doesn't provide any reasoning or examples to back this up. It's just citing a definition without explaining why it's an issue. So, the verifiability is low. It's not fully supported, so I'd rate this as 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out that the counterfactual violates a property but doesn't explain why it's a problem or suggest fixes. It lacks depth and actionable suggestions. Without knowing what's wrong or how to fix it, the authors won't gain much from this feedback. So, it's not very helpful. I'd rate this as 1 for helpfulness.\n\nOverall, the review is lacking in providing clear actions and sufficient justification, so all aspects are low.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing the proposed model with existing ones, but it doesn't specify exactly which models or how to implement this comparison. It's a good start, but it's vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know which models to look at or how to proceed. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions existing models where answers are used as inputs, like Revisiting Visual Question Answering Baselines. It does specify which models, so the grounding is solid. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is comparing with those models. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests comparing with existing models but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this comparison is necessary or beneficial. It's a good suggestion, but without supporting reasoning, it's only **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific area for improvement and provides a clear suggestion. It's helpful because it guides the authors to compare their model with others, which is a constructive step. It's not the most detailed, but it's definitely useful. So, this would be **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding an ablation study comparing the number of layers to performance. It's explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. But it's vague because it doesn't specify how to conduct the study or what metrics to use. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about an ablation study but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's not pointing to a specific section or figure, so the grounding is weak. However, it does mention what the study is about, which is somewhat specific. So, I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting an addition but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just a recommendation without supporting reasons. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer thanks the authors and adjusts their score, showing that the feedback was acknowledged. However, the suggestion itself isn't very detailed or specific. It's somewhat helpful because it's a positive note, but overall, it's not very helpful. So, I'd give it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is a 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Each of these has a scale from 1 to 5, with explanations for each score. Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the authors don't discuss computational aspects in detail except in the appendix and questions about practical usefulness in high dimensions. It also points out that their algorithm involves solving LPs in high dimensions with a parameter that's hard to calculate. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives a clear direction for the authors to improve. The review does suggest that the authors should discuss computational aspects more, which is an explicit action. However, it doesn't tell them exactly how to do that, like specific sections or methods. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review talks about computational aspects but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It mentions the appendix and high dimensions but doesn't point to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pinpointing the issue. It's not fully grounded, so I'd give it a 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the algorithm's high-dimensional aspects are unclear. It supports this by stating that the algorithm requires solving LPs in high dimensions with an uncalculable parameter. This is logical reasoning and references the authors' experiments on small datasets. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review does suggest areas for improvement and provides some reasoning, but it's a bit vague. It doesn't give detailed guidance on how to improve computational aspects or specific sections. So, it's somewhat helpful, scoring a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on how explicit, grounded, verifiable, and helpful the review point is. The scores are all 3 because each aspect is partially addressed but lacks the depth or specificity for a higher score.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests trimming questions after the first 10 because the model is a bag of words, which isn't efficient for longer sequences. The comment is explicit about the design choice and provides a clear action\u2014trimming the questions. It doesn't just say \"it's a bad idea\" but explains why and what to do. So, this is explicit and concrete. Therefore, it's highly actionable, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the model being a bag of words and the inefficiency of longer sequences. It doesn't explicitly point to a specific part of the paper, like a particular section or figure, but it's clear what's being addressed. So, it's fully grounded because it's about the model's architecture. The specificity is clear about the inefficiency, so I'll rate this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that longer sequences are not efficient for a bag of words model. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning beyond the model's limitations. It's a valid claim but lacks justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable, but not fully. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific inefficiency and suggests a practical change. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful for the authors. It doesn't seem vague or lacking in guidance. So, I'll rate this as 5.\n\nOverall, the review is quite effective in multiple aspects, providing clear and actionable feedback.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out specific changes that need to be made, like changing lines from red to green in the Supplementary Material and providing direct mappings for equations and algorithm numbers. These are clear actions the authors can take. The instructions are explicit, and the details are concrete, so this should be highly actionable. I think this deserves a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific sections in the Supplementary Material, like L502, L507, and L509, and refers to figures and tables. This shows that the reviewers have identified specific parts of the paper, which is good grounding. The specificity is high because it's not just a general comment but points to exact locations. So, I'll give this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or reasoning for why the changes are necessary. It just lists the fixes. Without supporting evidence, it's hard to say if these changes are valid or based on proper practices. So, this is unverifiable, which I'll rate as 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest specific fixes, which is helpful. However, since there's no justification, the authors might not know if these changes are necessary or why they're being made. This makes it somewhat helpful but not fully. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it provides some guidance but lacks depth.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, the scores should be actionability: 5, grounding_specificity: 5, verifiability: 1, and helpfulness: 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It also asks specific questions about retraining costs and comparisons. This seems like a clear action, so it's explicit. The suggestions are concrete, so it's not vague. I think this is highly actionable, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific areas like retraining costs and incremental updates.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says the main text should make it clearer that there are additional experiments in the supplement and summarize their results. It also asks questions. I think the action here is to make the supplement clearer, but the instructions are a bit vague. They mention summarizing results but don't specify how. So, it's explicit in pointing out the action but not clear on the exact steps. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I'd rate it a 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions the supplement but doesn't specify which part of the paper or exactly what needs to be summarized. It's just a general suggestion without pinpointing the section or providing more details. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. I'd give it a 3 here as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It's just telling the authors to do something but doesn't back it up with logical reasoning or references. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest improvements but is quite vague. It doesn't provide specific details on how to summarize the results or why the supplement needs clarification. This makes it somewhat helpful but not entirely. So, I'd rate it a 3.\n\nOverall, the review is clear in its intent but lacks specifics and justifications, making it somewhat actionable and helpful but not fully so in grounding and verifiability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that important references are missing and suggests a comparison. It gives specific references, which is good. But the suggestion is a bit vague\u2014just saying \"I encourage\" isn't very explicit. The authors might not know exactly how to perform the comparison. So, it's not fully actionable because the action isn't clearly defined.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment points out that GFF and EfficientFCN aim to implement fast semantic segmentation methods in an encode-decoder architecture. It also mentions the societal impact on the last page. This seems pretty specific because it references specific works and mentions a particular section of the paper. So, grounding_specificity should be high, maybe a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding references and doing a comparison. It doesn't provide any justification or examples, just mentions the references. So, it's not fully verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. Maybe a 3 since it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does suggest adding references and a comparison, which is helpful. It gives a clear direction but could be more detailed. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most. A 4 seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that Algorithm 1 uses a Vandermonde matrix, which is ill-conditioned and numerically unstable, especially for large n and small \u03b1. It also suggests that the algorithm might fail in practice and asks for experimental results. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer does suggest improvements by asking for experiments, which is a clear action. However, the suggestion is a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly what experiments to conduct, like whether they should test different values of n, \u03b1, or compare with other algorithms. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer refers to Algorithm 1 by name and mentions specific issues with the Vandermonde matrix. They also ask for experimental results, which are part of the paper. This seems pretty grounded because they're pointing to a specific part of the paper and what needs to be addressed there. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that Algorithm 1 might fail in practice due to numerical instability. They support this by citing known properties of Vandermonde matrices and suggest experiments as verification. The reasoning is clear, and they provide specific examples (like large n and small \u03b1). This seems well-supported, so it's **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer addresses a valid concern about the algorithm's practical performance and suggests experiments, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is somewhat vague about the specifics of the experiments. While it's helpful, it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback. So, this would be **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is clear and actionable, well-grounded, mostly verifiable, and mostly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out a scalability issue with the NC measure but doesn't specify how to address it. It's vague on the solution, so it's not explicit. Since the action isn't clear, it's not actionable. I think this falls under borderline actionable because it hints at a problem but doesn't give a direct fix.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions ImageNet as an example but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. It's more of a general suggestion, so I'd rate this as weakly grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer suggests a scalability issue but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's vague and lacks support, so it's unverifiable. That's a bit of a let-down because it doesn't help the authors much.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment raises a valid concern about scalability but doesn't offer any solutions or further explanation. It's somewhat helpful because it points out a problem, but without concrete suggestions, it's not fully helpful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect is rated based on how well the review point provides clear, specific, and justifiable feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It also questions the scalability of FMN. However, the suggestions are vague and do not provide clear guidance on how to improve the FMN or what specific changes to implement. Therefore, it is **Somewhat Actionable** (3).  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   The review point clearly references the 'filter manifold network' (FMN) and specifically asks about alternative architectures and scalability.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the PSA method requires more computation than baselines and explains how it's done in Algorithm 1. It also suggests comparing computation complexity in the experiment part. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement the comparison, so it's a bit vague. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Algorithm 1 and explains the computation process. It doesn't mention specific sections or tables, but it's clear which part it's talking about. So, I think this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to the relevant part and explains what's wrong.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests comparing computation complexity but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's vague and lacks justification, so it should be **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out an issue and suggests an experiment, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That would be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions specific issues like larger fonts for certain figures and suggests a \"CTRL\" long form explanation. It also points out a table could better emphasize data. These are all explicit actions the authors can take. The suggestions are clear and direct, so it's highly actionable. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific parts of the paper like figures and tables, which is good. It also mentions parameters and comparisons, which are specific elements. The grounding is strong because it accurately points to the parts being discussed. So, this is also a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides suggestions but doesn't back them up with references or logical reasoning. It's more of a directive without justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review offers clear suggestions and covers multiple points, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into detail about why these changes are necessary or how they improve the work. It's somewhat helpful but could be more comprehensive.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"I can't understand the meaning of the sentence... please rewrite it.\" The author is asking for clarification. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives a clear action for the author to take. In this case, the reviewer is asking the author to rewrite a sentence, which is an action. However, the instruction is quite vague. It doesn't specify how to rewrite it or what changes are needed. So, it's explicit that the author should rewrite, but it's not clear what exactly to do. That makes it somewhat actionable because the action is clear, but the specifics are missing. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific part of the paper, page 5, paragraph 3, line. That's pretty specific. It clearly identifies the section the author is referring to. So, the grounding is strong. But does it specify what's wrong? The reviewer just says the author can't understand the sentence. It doesn't provide any details or examples. So, while it's grounded, it's not specific about what needs to be addressed. Therefore, I'd rate this a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is a suggestion to rewrite a sentence. There's no claim here; it's just a request for clarification. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiability. So, it's an X, which I think should be scored as 1 because it doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking the author to rewrite a sentence they don't understand. While it's helpful in that it's asking for clarification, it's quite vague. The author might not know exactly how to proceed with rewriting. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the comparison is unfair because the baselines lack prior knowledge or language embeddings. It suggests a better comparison should be considered. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a specific action. They're suggesting a better comparison, which is a form of action, but it's vague. So, it's not explicit, which would make it implicit. Since it's vague, it doesn't give the authors a clear idea of how to fix it. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't specify how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is about the paper. The reviewer mentions baselines lacking prior knowledge and language embeddings. They don't explicitly say which part of the paper this refers to, like a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. However, they do identify that the comparison is problematic, which is better than not addressing it at all. So, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because they do touch on the issue but don't clearly specify the part of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the comparison is unfair. They need to back this up. But in the review point, there's no justification or evidence provided. They just state that the baselines lack prior knowledge. Without supporting references or logical reasoning, this claim isn't well-verified. So, this should be **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing to make the claim credible.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a problem with the comparison but isn't providing concrete suggestions on how to improve it. They suggest a better comparison but don't elaborate on what that better comparison should be or how to implement it. This is helpful in identifying the issue but lacks depth and specificity. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does point out an issue, but it's not comprehensive enough to be fully helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, justification, and guidance provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions several issues: output-side layers not benefiting, Figure 4 not being clear, details of Pixel-shuffle not presented, a question about Pixel-shuffle in super-resolution, the dimensionality after upsampling, and the authors not providing limitations or societal impact. \n\nLooking at explicitness, the reviewer is pointing out specific areas, so that's explicit. But the suggestions are quite vague. For example, instead of saying \"explain the Pixel-shuffle operation,\" they could specify \"provide a clear explanation of the Pixel-shuffle operation used in the super-resolution field.\" That makes it more actionable. So, it's not fully explicit because the suggestions are broad.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions specific parts like Figure 4 and details of Pixel-shuffle, which shows strong grounding. They also ask about the societal impact, which is a specific aspect of the work. So, this is fully grounded because they're pointing out exact sections and aspects of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the issues. For example, stating that the output-side layers don't benefit, the figure isn't clear, etc. Each of these claims is supported by the reviewer's observations, so they're verifiable. They're not citing external references, but their points are clear and based on their own analysis. So, this is somewhat verifiable because while there's no external citation, the reasoning is clear.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer covers several points, but each is quite broad. They don't offer specific fixes or detailed explanations. For instance, instead of just saying \"explain the Pixel-shuffle operation,\" they could suggest what kind of explanation would be helpful. This makes the feedback somewhat helpful but not the most detailed or actionable. So, it's somewhat helpful because there's value, but it could be improved for the authors.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is grounded and verifiable but lacks explicitness and detail in its actionable suggestions. It's somewhat helpful because it points out areas for improvement, but it's not the most comprehensive.\n</think>\n\n**Evaluation of Review Point:**\n\n- **Actionability**: The review is explicit but vague, making it somewhat actionable.  \n- **Grounding Specificity**: Strongly grounded by referencing specific parts of the paper and societal impact.  \n- **Verifiability**: Claims are verifiable with clear reasoning, though no external references are cited.  \n- **Helpfulness**: Provides some value but lacks detailed suggestions, making it somewhat helpful.  \n\n**Final Scores:**\n- **actionability_label**: 3  \n- **grounding_specificity_label**: 5  \n- **verifiability_label**: 3  \n- **helpfulness_label**: 3"}

Each aspect has its own criteria, so I'll tackle them one by one.\n\nStarting with actionability. The comment says the presentation is hard to follow. Is this an explicit or implicit action? Well, it's not telling the author what to do. It's more of a statement about the problem. So, it's implicit because the author still needs to figure out what to do next. Therefore, it's not actionable because the author isn't given a clear direction. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the comment is. The review says the presentation is hard to follow. But it doesn't specify which part of the presentation or what exactly is causing the issue. It's too vague. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint where the problem is. Hence, grounding_specificity would also be 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim that the presentation is hard to follow. But is this claim supported by any evidence? The reviewer is just stating their observation without providing any references or logical reasoning. There's no justification or examples given. So, it's not verifiable. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is pointing out that the presentation is hard to follow. While it's a valid concern, it's very vague. The reviewer isn't providing specific suggestions or pointing out particular areas that need improvement. Without more details, the author can't really know how to make the paper clearer. So, it's not very helpful. It's just a general statement, so helpfulness is 1.\n\nPutting it all together, all four aspects are rated as 1 because the review point is too vague and lacks specific, actionable, and justified feedback.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

However, the suggestion is somewhat vague as it doesn't specify how to present the models in more detail. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   The reviewer requests a discussion of the computation requirements of the three methods. The point mentions specific methods (KVAE, DMM, DVBF) and their differences, which is fully grounded. Additionally, it clearly specifies the aspect to be addressed, making it **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   The reviewer's claim is that KVAE is simpler but requires time-dependent parameters.

Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   The review point is clear and provides specific suggestions, making it highly helpful for the authors.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions including certain works and discussing how their work differs from others. It doesn't specify exactly what changes the authors should make or how to implement the comparison. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for inclusion but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this should be a 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific works by Li et al. and He et al. by name, which is pretty specific. It also mentions the need for a discussion on differences, which should be clear. So, this seems fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests including specific references. While it's a good idea, it doesn't provide enough justification or examples to back up why these references are necessary. It's somewhat verifiable but not fully. So, a 4 seems right here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the importance of including related work and discussing differences. It guides the authors in a meaningful direction without being too vague. This should be highly helpful, so a 5 makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 4, and helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the first quotation mark around \"in-between\" should be a forward quote. It explicitly states the correction, so that's clear. It also tells the author exactly what to change, which makes it actionable. There's no ambiguity here, so I think this is highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"in-between\" uncertainty and specifies that the forward quote should be used. It's clear and directly points to the part of the paper, so this is fully grounded and specific. No guesswork involved, just a precise reference. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is pointing out a formatting issue. It doesn't claim anything new or require justification. It's just a factual correction. There's no evidence or reasoning provided, so it's not verifiable. I'll rate this a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and directly tells the author what needs to be fixed. It's specific about the correction, so the author knows exactly how to adjust their work. While it's straightforward, it might not go beyond the basics, but it's still helpful. I think a 4 is appropriate here because it's clear but could be more detailed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The new proposed dataset, DRRI, could have been explored more in the paper.\" The first thing I notice is that it's suggesting an improvement, which is good. But is it explicit? Yes, it mentions DRRI and suggests more exploration. So that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It says \"could have been explored more,\" which is a bit vague. It tells the author what to do but doesn't specify how. For example, should they add more analysis, or maybe test different hypotheses? Without that detail, it's not very actionable. So I think this is borderline actionable because it's explicit but not concrete enough.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about DRRI but doesn't specify where in the paper it should be explored. It just says \"the paper\" generally. So the author can't pinpoint exactly which section or part needs more work. That means the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the specific part. Therefore, this is not grounded at all, so it's a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it suggests an improvement. But is there any support for it? The review doesn't provide evidence or reasoning why DRRI should be explored more. It's just a suggestion without backing. So there's no verifiability here. It's unverifiable, so a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does point out a potential improvement, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide specific guidance. Without knowing exactly what changes are needed, the authors might not find it very helpful. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 1 because it's not providing enough concrete information to be highly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is only borderline or not helpful enough, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The observed performance enhancements are somewhat modest, suggesting room for further refinement in the future.\" I'm trying to see if this gives the authors clear instructions on what to do. It mentions that performance is modest and suggests further refinement, but it doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implication rather than a direct action. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at an action but doesn't tell them exactly how to improve.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about performance enhancements and suggests further refinement. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this refers to. It's too vague. So, the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. This means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part being addressed.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review makes a claim that performance is modest and suggests further refinement. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or justification for this claim. There's no reference to external studies or common knowledge to support this observation. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing for the claim.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out a problem and suggests improvement, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't offer specific actionable steps. It tells the authors that something needs to be done but doesn't specify what or how. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully detailed, making it a 1 on the helpfulness scale.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is only at the lowest level because the review lacks explicitness, specificity, justification, and detail.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment asks the authors to provide references for two specific passages and to explain \"MLP\" in Figure 2. It's pretty clear what needs to be done, so that's explicit. But the instructions for each reference aren't detailed. For example, they just say \"please provide references\" without explaining how to find relevant literature or where to look. So it's explicit, but not very detailed. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"Section 3.2, lines 230-234 and 234-235\" and \"Figure 2\". That's pretty specific. They're pointing out exact sections and parts of the paper where the issues are. Also, they're asking for an explanation of \"MLP\", which is a term they're not defining. So they're clearly pointing to the relevant parts and what needs to be addressed. That should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making claims by asking for references and an explanation. However, it's not providing any supporting evidence or justification. They're just asking for references and an explanation, which is a request, not a claim that needs verification. So it's a **No Claim**, which is labeled as **X**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is asking for references and an explanation, which is helpful because it points out specific areas the authors need to improve. However, it's quite vague. They're not giving any guidance on how to find the references or what kind of explanation is needed for \"MLP\". This makes it somewhat helpful but not fully. So it's a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects. The comment is clear about what needs to be done but lacks the specifics on how to implement it, which affects its actionability and helpfulness. It's grounded because it references specific parts of the paper, but the verifiability is low because there's no justification or evidence provided. Overall, it's somewhat helpful but could be improved with more details.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the experimental results on two datasets aren't convincing and that the performance is similar to IRM. It also asks if the problems mentioned above are causing this. The comment suggests an action, which is pointing out the issue, but it's vague. It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next, like suggesting improvements or providing data. So, it's not explicit enough. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at an action but doesn't specify how to fix it. So, I'd give it a 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"the last two datasets\" and mentions \"performance is similar to IRM.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or figure this is referring to. The authors can only guess where the issue is. So, it's not fully grounded because it lacks specific references. It's weakly grounded with some specificity since it mentions the datasets and the comparison, but not the exact figure or section. So, I'd rate it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment makes a claim that the results aren't convincing and that the performance is similar to IRM. It doesn't provide any justification or references to back this up. There's no logical reasoning or external sources cited. So, it's unverifiable because there's no support for the claim. Therefore, it gets a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a problem and suggests looking into the issues mentioned, but it doesn't provide concrete solutions or further guidance. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an area for improvement, but it's vague and lacks detailed suggestions. So, it's somewhat helpful, which I'll rate a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is borderline in actionability, not fully grounded, unverifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"No empirical validation. I would have like to see some experiments where the bounds are validated.\" The comment is suggesting that the authors should provide experiments to validate their bounds. It's explicit about the action\u2014suggesting experiments\u2014but it doesn't specify how to implement it, like what kind of experiments or where to start. So it's explicit but vague. That would fall under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear that an action is needed but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"empirical validation\" and \"experiments where the bounds are validated.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or which sections to focus on. The authors can only guess where to add experiments. So the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part. The specificity is also low because it's not clear what exactly needs to be validated. So this would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**? Wait, no. Wait, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part, and the specificity is low because it's not detailed. So actually, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. The grounding is weak because it's not specific, and the specificity is low because it's not detailed. So the overall grounding_specificity would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**? Or maybe **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**? Wait, no, because it does mention \"experiments where the bounds are validated,\" which is specific. So maybe it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not fully clear which part to focus on, but it's pointing to a specific action.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The comment is making a claim by suggesting that experiments are needed for validation. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating that experiments should be done without explaining why or citing any sources. So this is **1: Unverifiable** because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a need for experiments but doesn't specify what kind or where to add them. It's clear and suggests an improvement, but it's vague. So it's somewhat helpful because it identifies an area for improvement, but it's not detailed enough. So it would be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nWait, but the initial assessment I did was:\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure about grounding_specificity. Maybe it's better to double-check. The grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part, but it's specific in suggesting experiments. So perhaps it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**. That makes sense because it's not fully clear which part to focus on, but it's pointing to a specific action.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the training time reduction is less drastic than the parameter reduction because most gradients are still computed for early down-sampling layers. It mentions the Discussion section but says to delete it. I think the action here is pointing out that the Discussion doesn't need revisiting, but it's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly what to do next. It's not clear if they need to make any changes or how to implement it. So, I'd say it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest a minor change but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the Discussion section, which is a part of the paper, so that's grounding. It also mentions gradients and down-sampling layers, which are specific technical details. So, the grounding is pretty solid. The specificity is good too because it explains why the reduction is less drastic and what part of the model is involved. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the Discussion doesn't need revisiting and suggests deleting it. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable. I'd rate this as **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out an issue and suggests a minor edit. It's clear and gives a specific instruction, which is helpful. The authors will know exactly what to do without ambiguity. So, this should be **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For actionability, it's somewhat actionable because it's clear but not explicit. Grounding is fully grounded because it references specific sections and technical terms. Verifiability is unverifiable because there's no justification. Helpfulness is mostly helpful because it's clear and specific. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Figure 6: the font size is a little bit small.\" The user is pointing out an issue with the figure's font size. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the review gives a clear instruction on what to do. In this case, the reviewer is telling the authors to fix the font size. But the instruction is pretty vague. It doesn't specify how to make the font size larger or suggest any particular method. So, it's an explicit action, but the details are missing. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear that something needs to be done, but it's not very detailed on how to do it. So, I think it should be a 4 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review mentions Figure 6 but doesn't specify which part of Figure 6 is problematic. It just says the font size is small. Without knowing which element in the figure is too small, the authors might not know where to focus their changes. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed. Therefore, grounding_specificity should be a 3.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review is a claim because it's suggesting a change (fixing the font size). Now, is this claim supported by evidence? The reviewer is pointing out that the font size is small, but there's no justification or reasoning provided. They're just stating the issue without explaining why it's a problem or how it affects the paper. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. It's more of a descriptive statement than a claim that needs justification. Hence, verifiability should be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a specific issue with a figure, which is good. However, it's very vague. It doesn't suggest any particular fixes or improvements. The authors might know that the font size needs to be increased, but there's no guidance on how to do that. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very detailed or actionable. Therefore, helpfulness should be a 4 because it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth in suggestions.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing CPEF with ExpertBert to make the comparison fair. It's explicit about the action, which is to recommend a comparison. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this\u2014like which specific changes to make or where to find ExpertBert. So it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions PMEF lacks a pre-training module and recommends comparing with ExpertBert. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed\u2014Figure 3 and lines 529-534. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the fairness of the comparison. So it's fully grounded and specific. That's a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the comparison is unfair and suggests an alternative. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up the claim. It's just stating that ExpertBert is a better choice without justification. So it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some justification but lacks key elements like examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and suggests a solution. It's clear and actionable for the authors, even though it doesn't provide detailed implementation steps. It's helpful but not the most detailed. So it's a **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is clear about what needs to be done but doesn't give all the details, so it's somewhat helpful. It's grounded and specific about the issue, and while it's somewhat verifiable, it lacks strong justification. Actionability is there but not fully detailed.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions concerns about fairness and potential information leakage but doesn't specify what changes the authors should make. It's vague, so it's not actionable. That would be a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about prior knowledge and information leakage but doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper. It's a bit vague, so it's weakly grounded. That's a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests potential issues but doesn't provide evidence or references. It's not fully supported, so it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment raises valid concerns but lacks specific suggestions. It's helpful in pointing out problems but doesn't guide solutions.

FLOT cost matrix in Algorithm 1 is not defined.\" based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Each aspect has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out that the FLOT cost matrix isn't defined in Algorithm 1. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The comment mentions the issue but doesn't specify how to fix it. It doesn't tell the author where to find the definition or what to add. So, it's not explicit or pointing out a direct action. Therefore, it's not actionable because the author needs to look elsewhere or ask for more details. So, I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the review is regarding the paper's part. The comment says the cost matrix isn't defined, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It could be any part, so the author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced section. So, this is also a 1 (Weakly Grounded and Not Specific).\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the cost matrix isn't defined. To verify this, we need to see if there's supporting evidence. The comment itself is a straightforward observation, but it doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to support the claim. Hence, a 1 (Unverifiable) score.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out an issue but doesn't provide any suggestions on how to fix it. It just states that the cost matrix isn't defined. Without any guidance on where to find the definition or what changes to make, the author isn't helped much. It's vague and lacks actionable advice. So, this is a 1 (Not Helpful at All).\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so each gets a 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors prove a specific term converges to zero. It's explicit, so that's good. But it doesn't tell them exactly how to prove it, just that they should. So it's explicit but not concrete. I think that's a 4 because it's actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions a specific equation and references another paper. It clearly points to the part of the paper being discussed, so that's fully grounded. Also, it specifies what needs to be addressed, which is good. So that's a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment claims that the second term converges to zero but doesn't provide proof. It references another paper, which is helpful, but it's not fully verifiable because the reasoning is vague. So I'd give it a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is encouraging the authors to address their questions, which is positive. It's clear and constructive, so that's a 5.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that 'connectivity' is misleading because it's not using structural connections between the brain and body. It doesn't tell the author what to do next. So, it's not giving an explicit action. That means it's not actionable. I think this falls under 'Unactionable' which is label 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions 'connectivity' but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly the issue is. It's just a vague comment. So, the author can't pinpoint where the problem is. That means it's not grounded. I'd give this a 'Not Grounded' which is label 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that 'connectivity' is misleading. But it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to back this claim. There's no reference to external studies or common knowledge to support why 'connectivity' is misleading. So, it's not verifiable. That would be label 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out an issue but doesn't suggest any fixes or improvements. It's just pointing out that 'connectivity' is misleading. Without any actionable steps, it's not very helpful. So, I'd rate this as 'Somewhat Helpful' but since it's not fully helpful, maybe label 3. Wait, actually, since it's not providing any specific changes, maybe it's better to give it a lower score. Hmm, but the instruction says to rate it on a scale from 1 to 5. Since it's not helpful at all, maybe label 1. But I'm a bit confused here. The initial thought was label 3, but now I'm reconsidering. Maybe it's better to stick with label 1 because it doesn't help the author improve beyond pointing out the issue.\n\nWait, no, the helpfulness scale is 1 to 5, with 1 being not helpful at all. Since the review does identify an issue, even if it's not actionable, it's somewhat helpful. So maybe label 3 is better. But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that step 3 is the vital part and suggests studying it to validate the use of orthogonal matrices. It doesn't specify how to do this or provide concrete steps. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but vague on the solution. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to step 3 as vital and mentions orthogonal matrices. It doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper this refers to, like a specific section or figure. So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific**, but since it's not pinpointing the exact part, maybe it's better to say it's **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**. Wait, no, the review does mention step 3, which is specific. Hmm, maybe it's **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it refers to a particular step. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. It says step 3 is vital and suggests studying it, which is specific. So, I'll go with **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that orthogonal matrices are essential and suggests studying step 3. It doesn't provide any evidence or references, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it mentions the necessity but lacks justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and suggests a solution, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, so it should be **5: Highly Helpful**. Wait, but earlier I thought actionability was 3. Maybe I should adjust that. Since the review is clear about the problem and suggests a solution, actionability should be higher. Maybe **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks some detail on how to implement the solution.\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me clarify:\n\n- **Actionability**: The review explicitly mentions the problem (step 3) but doesn't provide concrete steps on how to validate the use of orthogonal matrices. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully. So, **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\n- **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to step 3, which is specific, so it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\n- **Verifiability**: The claim is that orthogonal matrices are essential, but there's no justification or evidence provided. So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\n- **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about the problem and suggests a solution, making it highly helpful. So, **5: Highly Helpful**.\n\nI think that makes sense now. The review is clear and actionable, even though it doesn't provide detailed justification or implementation steps.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the authors should state how they handle comparisons between episodes of different lengths. It also mentions their current method of padding shorter sequences and the lack of a normalization factor. This gives the authors clear steps to follow, so the action is explicit. Additionally, it provides concrete details about the padding method and the normalization issue, so the authors know exactly what to do. Therefore, this is highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the code, like the padding method and the normalization factor. It also explains how these relate to the comparison of trajectories. This means the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue lies without having to infer much. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides logical reasoning about why padding is done and how the normalization factor affects the distance metric. It references the code, which is a form of external support, and explains the implications of not having the factor. This makes the claim verifiable, though it could be more detailed. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully robust.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions and explains the implications of the authors' choices. It helps the authors understand potential issues without requiring them to check the code, which is helpful. However, it could be more comprehensive by including more details on the normalization factor and its impact. Overall, it's highly helpful.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, each aspect seems to be at a high level, except maybe verifiability could be a bit better. But overall, the review is very useful for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests the author didn't consider Vision Transformer and asks if the pruning strategy differs for larger datasets. The comment is explicit about the missing consideration and provides a specific question, so it's clear what needs to be done. However, it doesn't give detailed steps on how to implement this, just points out the omission and asks a question. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but vague on the action.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions Vision Transformer by name, which is specific, and refers to ImageNet as a larger dataset. It doesn't just say \"another model\" but names a specific alternative. It also asks a question about the pruning strategy, which is specific to the mentioned technique. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to the sections and clearly specifies what's missing.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that Vision Transformer isn't effective for larger datasets. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just a statement without justification, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review points out a specific weakness and asks a relevant question, which is helpful. However, it's somewhat vague and doesn't provide detailed suggestions.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing the continuous diffusion model as a baseline in Table 3. It also mentions a recent work using GDSS for conditional generation. I think the action here is clear: compare the models. But the instructions say it's explicit if the action is direct. Here, the reviewer is giving a suggestion but not exactly detailing how to implement it. So, it's more of an implicit action. Since it's not fully explicit, I'd rate it as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions specific models like GDSS and DiGress and references a recent work [2]. This clearly points to specific parts of the paper, so the grounding is strong. They also explain what the models do, which adds specificity. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that continuous diffusion outperforms discrete ones. They back it up with Table 2 and suggest a recent work as a baseline. The evidence is there, though maybe a bit brief.

It suggests spelling out F.L.T.R in Figure 4, making the text too small, and recommends cross-referencing M and N in the figure.\n- The actions here are explicit: spell out the acronym, address the text size, and cross-reference.

It doesn't just refer to general areas but pinpoints exact sections, so this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims about the comparison results but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just asks for more data, which means the claims aren't well-supported. So this is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and points out specific areas for improvement, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide detailed explanations or references, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that Figure 1 refers to [15] as \"PointNet,\" which isn't present in the paper, and mentions another paper with the same name. It suggests adding a clarification. This is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do\u2014add a clarification. It's not vague or inferred, so it's definitely actionable. Therefore, this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific figure ([15]) and provides a citation. It also explains why the reference is confusing. Since it clearly points to a specific part of the paper and explains the issue, this is fully grounded. The specificity is good because it not only identifies the problem but also gives context. So, this should also be a high score, probably 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that Figure 1 incorrectly refers to PointNet. It supports this by providing the correct citation. The reasoning is clear and logical, and it references an external source, making it fully verifiable. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific issue, suggesting a clear improvement, and providing a reference. It's concise and directly helpful. While it could be expanded, it's already quite useful. So, a 4 seems appropriate because it's mostly helpful but could be a bit more detailed.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. The review is explicit and actionable, fully grounded, and well-verified, making it highly helpful overall.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a section about the threat model, including specifics like attacker capabilities and resources. It's explicit about the action, which is to add this section. But does it give clear instructions on how to do this? The comment is a bit vague about what exactly to include, like whether it should be a dedicated section or part of another section. So, while the action is clear, the details are not. I think this is **actionable** but not **highly actionable** because it's a bit vague on implementation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions adding a section but doesn't specify which part of the paper. It's a bit vague about where to put this information. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact section. It's more of a suggestion without clear reference to a specific part of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion to add more details about the threat model. It's not a claim that requires evidence, so it's a normal statement. Therefore, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting a section to add, which is helpful. It guides the authors to improve their paper by specifying where to include the threat model details. This seems quite helpful, so I'd rate it as highly helpful.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Actionability: 4 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 2 (Weakly Grounded and Not Specific)\n- Verifiability: 1 (Unverifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 5 (Highly Helpful)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors should explain what a proper rotation matrix is and clarify the matrix being non-positive semidefinite. It's explicit about the actions, so that's good. But it doesn't give specific instructions on how to do that, like suggesting a reference or a method. So it's not fully actionable because the implementation details are missing. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific lines (97, 105-106) which shows it's grounded because it accurately points to parts of the paper. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, so it's specific. Therefore, this should be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides questions but doesn't back them up with evidence or references. It's just asking the authors to explain something, which isn't helpful for verifiability. So it's unverifiable, making it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest specific areas for improvement and asks detailed questions, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any rationale or references to support why these changes are necessary, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That would be a 4.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect is a 3 except helpfulness, which is a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests replacing the g activation function with a binary operator, similar to Cohen and Shashua (2016). It's pretty explicit about the change, so that's a clear action. The comment also mentions that this fulfills the required conditions, which gives the authors a direct idea of how to apply the change. Since the action is both explicit and concrete, I think this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific reference, Cohen and Shashua (2016), which clearly points to a particular piece of work. It also explains why the change is relevant, tying it to fulfilling required conditions. This strong grounding makes it easy for the authors to understand exactly what's being suggested. So I'd rate this as 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment references a specific paper and suggests a change that aligns with its introduced operator. This provides a logical reasoning and an external reference, which makes the claim verifiable. However, it doesn't go into much detail about why exactly the binary operator is better or how it affects their model. There's a minor gap in explanation, but it's still mostly verifiable. I think a 4 is appropriate here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting a specific change and references an external source. It provides a clear direction for the authors, which is helpful. While it could be more detailed, it's still comprehensive enough to be highly helpful. So I'll give it a 5.\n\nOverall, the review point is quite thorough and actionable, with strong grounding and verifiability, making it very helpful for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. The action is clear\u2014shrink the captions. There's no vagueness here; it's straightforward. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the captions of Figure 1 and 2 overlapping with the content. It's specific because it points out exactly where the overlap is. It doesn't just say \"there's a problem,\" but specifically refers to the captions. So, this is well-grounded and specific. I'll also give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the captions overlap. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this claim. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable. I'll rate this as 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and directly addresses the issue. It gives the authors a specific action to take. While it could be more detailed, it's still helpful. So, I'll give it a 4.\n\nI think that's all.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests the authors add details about the CUDA and PyTorch versions used. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. The action is clear: describe the environment. It's not vague because it specifies exactly which details to include. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific versions, which grounds it because it points to a particular part of the code or setup. It's not just a general statement; it's specific enough for the authors to know where to focus. So, this should be fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the impact of different versions on performance. It's not a claim that needs evidence because it's a suggestion. So, there's no claim extraction here, which means it's an \"X\" for verifiability. But since the instruction says to assess verifiability only if a claim exists, and there isn't one, I'll mark it as \"X\".\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear and directly tells the authors what to do. It's actionable and provides a specific improvement direction. While it's not the most detailed, it's still very helpful. So, a 4 seems appropriate here because it's mostly helpful but could be a bit more comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that fully realistic datasets will make it hard to control multiple aspects of variation with precision. It also mentions agreeing with the authors' judgment about no immediate societal impact. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the review suggests using realistic datasets but doesn't specify how to implement this or what changes are needed. It's more of an agreement than a directive. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this should be a low score, maybe 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review talks about datasets but doesn't pin down which part of the paper or which specific issue. It's a bit vague, so the grounding isn't strong. It's not fully specific, so I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that fully realistic datasets will make controlling multiple aspects hard. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's just an opinion without backing, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is somewhat critical, pointing out a potential issue with datasets and agreeing with the authors. However, it's not very detailed or specific. It doesn't offer clear guidance on how to improve the draft. So, it's helpful but not very much. I'd give it a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own score based on how well the review meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the standard deviation is 3, but the plot shows it's not a high noise value. It recommends studying the model under higher noise. The action here is clear: study higher noise. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do this? Not really. They might need to adjust parameters or run simulations themselves. So it's explicit but lacks detail on implementation. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the standard deviation of the noise is 3, which is specific. It also points out that the plot shows it's not high noise, which is another specific point. The authors can pinpoint where to focus. So this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a **5**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that 3 isn't high noise and suggests higher noise. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the observation. It's clear but lacks justification. So it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issue and provides a suggestion. It helps the authors understand where to focus but doesn't go into how to implement the change or provide more context. It's helpful but not the most detailed, so a **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring I'm consistent with the criteria.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the bounds have o(1) terms and start improving for long inputs but doesn't specify how large these inputs need to be. It also questions the practical applications. I think the comment is pointing out a limitation but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. They still need to figure out the input size and practical uses on their own. So, it's not explicit, which would make it implicit. Since it's not giving clear instructions, it's probably not highly actionable. Maybe it's somewhat actionable if they can infer, but I think it's more like borderline actionable because the action isn't clearly stated.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the bounds and input size but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where the issue lies, so the grounding is weak. However, it does mention the input size, which is specific, so there's some specificity. I'm leaning towards weakly grounded and specific because it's not entirely clear but does touch on a specific aspect.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states a claim that the bounds start improving for long inputs but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. The authors don't know why this would be the case or if it's reliable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or ask for clarification. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue, but without specific guidance, it's not fully helpful. So, it's somewhat helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that Section 2 has a limited connection to the methodology and that the theoretical analysis is somewhat simplistic, citing another work. It doesn't specify what changes the authors should make, so it's explicit but vague. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the review points out issues in Section 2 and references another work. However, it doesn't clearly identify which part of Section 2 is problematic or why the connection is limited. It's a bit vague, so it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nRegarding **verifiability**, the review includes a citation to another work, which adds some support. However, the reasoning is vague about why the connection is limited and why the analysis is simplistic. It lacks specific references or clear justification, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides some feedback on the connection and the analysis but doesn't offer detailed suggestions on how to improve it.

I doubt that the paper in its present state is strong enough for ICLR.\" Let me break it down based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says the paper isn't strong enough for ICLR. That's a statement of doubt, but does it tell the authors what to do? It doesn't suggest any specific changes or improvements. So, it's not explicit or pointing out exactly what needs to be done. Therefore, it's not actionable. Maybe a 1 here.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This is about how specific the comment is. The review mentions ICLR, which is a conference, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper is lacking. It's too vague. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the issue. Maybe a 1 here too.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim that the paper isn't strong enough. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a guess without any backing. So, it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 here as well.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is a critique that the paper isn't good enough for a top conference. While it's helpful in pointing out the problem, it doesn't offer any specific suggestions or evidence. It's vague and lacks actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Maybe a 1 here too.\n\nOverall, the review is negative but lacks specific details and actionable suggestions. It doesn't help the authors improve their work significantly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that experiments should be run multiple times and suggests a community effort for reproducibility. It also cites a reference. I think the action here is clear: run multiple experiments and report stats. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do this? It says \"run multiple times\" but doesn't specify how many or what exactly to do. So it's explicit in terms of what to do but vague on the details. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review talks about reproducibility and a community effort but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs fixing. It's more of a general suggestion without pinpointing the issue. However, it does mention citing a reference, which is a specific action. So I think it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the reference, even if the general part isn't very specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests citing a specific paper. That's a clear reference, so it's well-supported. It doesn't make any claims beyond that, so it's **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review provides a clear suggestion to run experiments multiple times and cites a relevant paper. It's helpful because it gives a specific action and references existing work. It's not too vague, so it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says, \"There are some minor issues: Please check Figure 2, Line 433, and Line 468. Some equations end with a period, while others end with a comma. Please ensure they are consistent.\" \n\nFirst, is this an explicit action? Yes, it tells the authors exactly where to check (Figure 2, Lines 433 and 468). So that's explicit. Now, is the action concrete? It tells them exactly what to do: check those lines and ensure equations end consistently. It doesn't just say \"fix something,\" it specifies where and what to fix. So that's concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 2 and specific lines (433 and 468). It's explicit about which parts of the paper need checking. It doesn't make the authors guess where to look; they know exactly where to go. Also, it specifies what the issue is (inconsistent punctuation). So this is fully grounded and specific. That's a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that there are inconsistencies in the equations' punctuation. It then asks the authors to check specific lines. But does it provide any justification for why this is a problem? It just states the issue without explaining why it's problematic or how common this issue is. There's no reference to standards or previous discussions about punctuation consistency. So the justification is minimal, making it unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear and tells the authors exactly where to look and what to do. It's specific and actionable. However, it only addresses part of the paper (Figure 2 and two lines) and doesn't mention other potential issues. It's helpful but not comprehensive. So it's mostly helpful, which is a 4.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

It's explicit about the question, so that's good. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. They might need to design experiments or analyze the data further. So, it's not fully actionable because the next steps aren't specified. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Figure 1 specifically by asking about its origin. It's clear which part of the paper is being discussed, so that's fully grounded. Then, it asks about conducting real experiments, which is specific to the figures. So, both grounding and specificity are met, making this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the figures are either real or artificial. It suggests conducting real experiments, which is a logical reasoning step. It doesn't reference external literature, but the reasoning is clear. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a direct question about the figures and suggesting an improvement. It's clear and provides a specific area for the authors to focus. While it doesn't give detailed methods, it's still helpful enough to guide them. So, this is a 4.\n\nI think that's all. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and the scores make sense given the content of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"an example and perhaps a figure would be quite helpful in explaining the definition of uniform shattering.\" The user is suggesting adding examples or figures to clarify a concept. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the reviewer gives a clear instruction on what to do. In this case, the reviewer is suggesting adding elements, but they don't specify how to add them or where exactly. It's a bit vague. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because they do suggest an action but don't give detailed steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in pointing out the part of the paper. The reviewer mentions \"an example and perhaps a figure\" but doesn't specify which section or part of the paper. They're referring to a general idea, so the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because they're not pinpointing the exact area. So, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because they do mention what's needed but don't clearly identify the part.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. They're just saying that examples or figures would help, but there's no justification for why that's necessary or helpful. So, this doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability. I think this should be **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing or explanation provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is providing a suggestion to improve the paper by adding examples or figures. This is helpful because it gives a clear direction for the authors. However, the suggestion is quite general and doesn't go into detail about how to implement it. So, while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does offer some guidance but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own score based on how well the review meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the assumption among classes is not practice and mentions that the formulation is somewhat trivial. It talks about optimization and theoretical analysis but doesn't specify how to improve it. I think the comment is pointing out an issue but doesn't give clear steps on what to do next. So, it's not explicit because it's more of an implicit suggestion. It's also vague because it doesn't explain how to make the formulation better. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability because it's not actionable enough.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions that the assumption is not practice and talks about optimization and theoretical properties. It doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper it's referring to, like a particular section or figure. It's a bit vague, so I think it's only weakly grounded because it's not pinpointing the exact issue. However, it does explain what's wrong, so it's somewhat specific. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the assumption is not practice and mentions the formulation is somewhat trivial. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up these claims. So, the claim is there, but there's no support, making it unverifiable. Therefore, I'll rate this as 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that the assumption isn't practical and that the formulation is trivial, suggesting there's room for optimization. It does offer some direction but is quite vague. It gives the authors something to think about but doesn't provide detailed guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'll rate this as 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own score based on how well the review point meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says that some explanations are a little vague, specifically pointing out the last paragraph of Section 3. It doesn't give a clear action or suggestion. So, it's not explicitly telling the authors what to do. That means it's not actionable because the authors don't know what changes to make. It's more like a comment that acknowledges a problem but doesn't help them fix it. So, I think this is unactionable, which would be a score of 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions the last paragraph of Section 3 but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It just says \"the single image case.\" Without more context, the authors might not know exactly where to focus their improvements. So, it's not fully grounded because it's not pointing to a specific section or part. Therefore, this should be a score of 3, which is weak grounding with some specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review doesn't provide any justification or reasoning for why the last paragraph is problematic. It just states that the explanations are vague. There's no reference to external knowledge or logical reasoning to support this claim. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing to help the authors understand why the issue is important. That would be a score of 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out an area that needs improvement, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide specific suggestions or reasoning. It's somewhat helpful because the authors know there's an issue, but they don't know how to fix it or why it's a problem. So, it's not fully helpful but better than nothing. That would be a score of 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is unactionable, weakly grounded, unverifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that PRANC is modified but doesn't compare it directly in language or vision tasks. It does compare training loss and rank in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 but doesn't directly compare test accuracy. So, the action suggested is to compare test accuracy, which is explicit. But the review doesn't tell the authors exactly how to do this comparison. They need to figure out where to add the test accuracy section themselves. That makes the action somewhat vague. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability because it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Sections 3.4 and 3.5 by name, which is pretty specific. It also mentions test accuracy, which is a clear aspect of the paper. There's no part where it's just vague or refers to a general area. So, this should be a 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests comparing test accuracy but doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's just a suggestion without justification. So, this is somewhat verifiable but lacks support. I'd rate this a 3 on verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a missing comparison, which is helpful. It guides the authors to look for a specific metric, which can help them improve. However, it doesn't tell them exactly where to find this information or how to present it. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I think a 4 is appropriate here because it's clear and actionable, though not entirely complete.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the specifics of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding experiments on tasks like language modeling, machine translation, or text summarization. It's explicit about the action, which is to include these tasks. But it doesn't specify how to implement this, like whether they should replace existing experiments or add them alongside. So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the method isn't detailed. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** (label 3).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, and text summarization. It clearly points out where in the paper these experiments should be added, which is section 5.3. This shows strong grounding because it accurately references the paper's structure. Additionally, it specifies what needs to be added, making it **Fully Grounded and Specific** (label 5).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides clear suggestions and logical reasoning. It explains why these tasks are important and how they relate to the paper's main motivation. It doesn't rely on external references but uses common knowledge about language modeling tasks. This makes it **Somewhat Verifiable** (label 3) because while it's logical, it could benefit from more examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers specific suggestions and identifies clear areas for improvement. It's actionable and provides a clear direction for the authors. However, it could be more detailed, like suggesting specific metrics or comparing results with other models. Despite this, it's still highly helpful because it guides the authors on what changes to make. So, it's **Mostly Helpful** (label 4).\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the clarity, specificity, and support provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Therefore, it is **1: Unactionable**.\n\n**Grounding Specificity (1-5):**\n\n- The comment does not specify which part of the paper is being addressed. It is vague about the improvement, so it is **1: Not Grounded**.\n\n**Verifiability (1-5):**\n\n- The comment is a claim that the improvement is not impressive. However, there is no supporting evidence or justification provided. Thus, it is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\n**Helpfulness (1-5):**\n\n- The comment provides a judgment but lacks justification or specifics. It is somewhat helpful but not very useful for the authors.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"1 Novelty is limited. The design is not quite new, based on the fact that attention for motion learning has been widely used in video understanding.\" It mentions that the design isn't new and references existing work. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to change or how to improve their work. So, it's not giving a clear action or specific steps. That means it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"attention for motion learning\" and mentions it's widely used. However, it doesn't specify exactly where or how this applies to the paper. The authors might not know precisely which part of their work needs improvement. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or issue. I'd also rate this as 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the design isn't new and references existing work. It doesn't provide any evidence or justification for why this is a problem or how it affects their work. There's no logical reasoning or references to back up the claim. So, it's not verifiable. That's another 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that the design isn't new and references existing work. While it's a valid point, it doesn't offer specific suggestions or actionable steps for the authors. It's more of a criticism without providing clear guidance. Therefore, it's not very helpful. I'd give this a 1 as well.\n\nSo, all four aspects are rated as 1 because the review lacks explicit actions, specific grounding, verifiable claims, and helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the model design is unclear and suggests providing a plot, pseudo-code, or code repository. It also mentions that Neurochaos Learning isn't well-known, so reproducibility is important. The action here is clear: the authors should provide specific materials. But the instructions say to give explicit actions. The review doesn't tell them exactly what to do, like whether to add a figure or a table. It's more of an implicit suggestion. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors have to infer what to do. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions model architecture and learning details but doesn't specify which part of the paper. It talks about Neurochaos Learning not being well-known, which is a bit vague. The grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. They know it's in the model design but not the specifics. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the issue but doesn't clearly specify what part.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests providing materials and references to show reproducibility. It's clear that the authors need to do this, and it's backed by the fact that Neurochaos Learning isn't well-known. So, the claim is that providing these materials will help with reproducibility, and it's well-supported. That makes it **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review gives specific suggestions like plots, tables, or code, and mentions the importance of reproducibility. It's clear and actionable, so the authors will find this helpful. It's not just vague advice but concrete steps they can take. So, it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that's a solid breakdown. Each aspect is evaluated based on how clear and actionable the suggestions are, how specific the references are, how well the claims are supported, and how useful the overall comment is for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the rejection rate isn't shown, but it's unclear how this helps the authors. It suggests considering misclassifications as rejections but doesn't provide specific actions or details. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It just talks about rejection rates without pointing to any section or figure. So, it's not grounded because it can't be confidently identified. That's a 3 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states that rejection rates aren't shown, which doesn't help in verifying anything. So, it's unverifiable, scoring a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is vague and doesn't offer specific suggestions. It's more of a general observation without actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. That's a 3 as well.\n\nOverall, the review is clear but lacks specific details and justifications, making it somewhat helpful but not fully actionable or verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The review suggests an action: optimizing Figure 1 to use less whitespace. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly how to apply the action\u2014by reducing whitespace. So it's both explicit and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to Figure 1, which is specific. It doesn't make vague references but points to a specific part of the paper. So it's fully grounded. Also, it specifies what needs to be addressed, which is optimizing the figure. That's specific. So grounding_specificity is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it suggests an improvement. It needs to be supported. However, the justification is minimal\u2014it just says \"could be optimized\" without explaining why or providing evidence. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a specific area for improvement and suggests a change. It's clear and actionable, so it's helpful. However, it doesn't provide much detail on how to optimize the figure, which could make it more helpful. So it's a 4.\n\nI think that's all. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and the scores make sense given the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper doesn't follow the NeurIPS style, specifically the abstract font and bottom margins. It suggests fixing the style to gain space and include experiments in the main body. The action here is clear: fix the formatting. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? The review doesn't specify, like whether to use a certain tool or check a particular guide. So it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give detailed steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So I'd rate this as 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the formatting not following NeurIPS, which is specific. It mentions the abstract font and margins, which are clear parts of the paper. It also suggests improvements, which are directly tied to these specific elements. The grounding is strong because it clearly references the sections. Specificity is also good because it tells the authors exactly what's wrong and what needs fixing. So this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the formatting is off and suggests fixes. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back up these claims. It's just an opinion without evidence. So it's not verifiable. I'd give this a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out clear issues and provides suggestions for improvement. It's specific about what needs fixing and how it could help the authors. The feedback is clear and directly useful, even though it doesn't provide detailed methods. It's helpful but could be more so if it had more specifics. I think a 4 is appropriate here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Fig.4: On the color bar, presumably one of the labels should say 'worse'.\" It mentions Fig.4 and suggests a change to the color bar labels. It's explicit about pointing out a specific issue and suggests a fix. The action is clear: authors should adjust the labels. It doesn't leave room for interpretation, so it's explicit. Also, it provides concrete details about where the change should be made. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Fig.4 and mentions the color bar. It's specific about the part of the paper being addressed, so the grounding is full. It also clearly states what's wrong and what needs to be changed, which adds specificity. Therefore, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any justification or evidence. It doesn't explain why changing the label to \"worse\" is necessary or how this improves the paper. There's no reference to external studies or common practices, so it's not verifiable. It's just a suggestion without support, so it should be unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a specific issue and suggests a change. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any reasoning or evidence for why the change is needed, which might make it somewhat lacking in depth. So, it's mostly helpful because it gives a clear direction, but it could be improved by adding more justification.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"3. Row 757 in Supp. Page 29: '\u2026training/validation/test' should be '\u2026training/validation/test sets'.\" It seems like it's pointing out a specific change needed in the paper. The comment is explicit about the exact line and what needs to be changed. It doesn't just suggest a change; it clearly states what should be fixed. So, it's explicit and gives a direct action. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly where and what to change. So, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment mentions \"Row 757 in Supp. Page 29\" and specifies the exact text to change. It's not just pointing to a section but pinpoints the exact line and the issue. So, the grounding is full because it accurately identifies the part of the paper being addressed. Then, it clearly states what's wrong, which makes it specific. Therefore, this should also be a 5.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a suggestion to fix a typo in the text. It doesn't claim to be an opinion or require justification. It's a straightforward request. There's no claim here, so according to the definitions, it's an \"X\" for verifiability. But since the instruction says to assign a score from 1 to 5, and \"X\" isn't an option, I think it's better to mark it as 1 because it's not providing any justification or reasoning.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is clear and specific about a minor change. It tells the authors exactly where to make the adjustment. It's actionable and provides a clear direction. Even though it's a small change, it's still helpful because it guides the authors on what to do. So, this should be a 5.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, the comment doesn't provide any justification. It's just stating a correction. So, it's not claiming anything, so it's \"X\". But since the scale doesn't include \"X\", I have to choose between 1 and 5. Since it's a factual correction without any reasoning, it's unverifiable, so 1 makes sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores should be actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding extra brackets around a term and possibly defining it separately. These are explicit actions because the reviewer is directly telling the authors what to do. The instructions are clear, so the authors know exactly how to apply them. That makes it actionable. But is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies exactly what to add. So I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while it's clear, it might be a bit vague on how to implement it, like whether to add brackets or define the term. Wait, no, the reviewer does specify both actions, so maybe it's more concrete. Hmm, maybe it's **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's clear and gives direct instructions.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the definition, so they're identifying exactly where the confusion is. They're not just saying it's unclear but pointing to the term with brackets. That's fully grounded because they're pinning down the exact element. Then, they're also suggesting adding brackets and defining the term, which is specific about what needs to be addressed. So this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the definition is confusing and suggesting a change. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided. They're just stating their opinion without backing it up. So this is **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification or evidence given to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides specific suggestions for improvement, which is helpful. They're not vague; they're giving clear directions. However, the suggestions are somewhat limited because they only mention adding brackets and defining a term. It doesn't cover other possible areas where the definition might be unclear. So it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it's clear and actionable but not comprehensive.\n\nWait, but for actionability, I initially thought 3, but maybe it's 4 because the instructions are explicit and concrete. Let me double-check. The reviewer says exactly what to do, so that's explicit. It's also concrete because they specify the exact changes. So actionability should be **4: Mostly Actionable**.\n\nSo, final scores:\n- Actionability: 4\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that \"OAA\" is never referenced in the body text and points out missing content in the appendix. It also suggests that the caption might be outdated. Now, for actionability, it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The review does explicitly state the actions the authors need to take, like checking the appendix and updating the caption. That's explicit. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to do that, like whether to look for specific sections or what changes to make. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figure 3 and \"OAA\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or why exactly it's an issue. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where to look in the appendix or what specific changes are needed. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Therefore, it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points out that \"OAA\" isn't referenced and suggests checking the appendix. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support why \"OAA\" should be referenced or why the appendix is missing. It's more of a statement than a claim with justification. So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some implicit justification but it's vague.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify an issue and provides some suggestions, but it's quite vague. The authors might not know exactly what steps to take or where to look in the appendix. It lacks depth and clarity, so it's somewhat helpful but not very. That would be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is clear about the issues but doesn't provide enough detail or guidance for the authors to act effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors make their introduction clearer by explicitly stating that their solution is a fix of [12] rather than a new PIC approach. It also mentions lines 29-30 where they introduced their framework. This seems like a clear, direct action the authors can take. They know exactly what to do\u2014they need to add a specific mention in the introduction. So, this is explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out that the authors need to mention [12] in lines 29-30. It clearly identifies the specific part of the paper (lines 29-30) and what's wrong (not acknowledging prior work). This is fully grounded because it references a specific section and provides a clear issue. So, grounding_specificity should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the authors need to make their introduction clearer. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for this claim. It's vague and lacks specifics. Without backing, authors might not know how to improve their introduction. So, this is probably a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but not fully supported.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a suggestion but doesn't elaborate on why it's important or how it helps. It's clear and actionable, but it doesn't go into depth about the benefits or implications. So, it's helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded for more depth.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions missing comparisons with NeRF-based methods like Zero-1-to-3 and point-e, and it also points out that the occlusion experiment isn't relevant. It doesn't specify how to add these comparisons or what changes are needed. So, the action is explicit\u2014comparing with other methods\u2014but the details on how to implement this are vague. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but not exactly how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about missing comparisons and the lack of relevance for the occlusion experiment. It doesn't mention specific sections or unique aspects of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing exactly where the issues are. It's more general, so I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does touch on issues but doesn't clearly identify the parts.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests adding comparisons but doesn't provide any justification or references. It also mentions the occlusion experiment without explaining why it's irrelevant. Since there's no supporting evidence or reasoning, this is **1: Unverifiable** because the claims made aren't backed up.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out areas for improvement, like adding comparisons and explaining the lack of relevance. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete suggestions or details. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive, making it a **3: Somewhat Helpful** score.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions, considering how explicit, grounded, verifiable, and helpful the comments are.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review point suggests adding a brief explanation of \"multi-aspect\" and clarifying the subscripts in Figure 1. It seems like it's giving the authors two specific actions to take. The explanation is explicit, so the authors know exactly what to do. Also, the subscripts are clearly mentioned, so there's no ambiguity. Since both parts are directly addressed and the actions are clear, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review points out specific elements in the paper: the \"multi-aspect\" explanation and the subscripts in Figure 1. It's not just a general comment; it's pinpointing exactly where the issues are. The authors can easily identify where to focus their improvements. So this is fully grounded. Also, it's specific because it tells them exactly what needs to be done. Another 5 for this aspect.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support its claims. It's just stating what needs to be done without backing it up. There's no justification given, so it's not verifiable. I should give this a 1 because it doesn't meet the criteria for being verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest two clear actions, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague in explaining why these changes are necessary or how they will improve the paper. It could be more detailed to really help the authors understand the impact of their changes. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. A 4 seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors consider using model freezing or LoRA instead of applying SVD. It doesn't specify exactly how to implement these methods, like which layers to freeze or how to apply LoRA. So, it's explicit in suggesting actions but doesn't give detailed steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think a 4 here because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about model layers and parameter-efficient methods but doesn't reference a specific part of the paper. It's a bit vague, so the authors might have to guess where to apply these methods. That's weak grounding because it's not pointing to a specific section or figure. I'd give it a 3 since it's not fully grounded but there's an attempt.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any evidence or references. It just suggests methods without supporting why they're good or how they work. So, it's unverifiable. A score of 1 makes sense here because there's no justification or examples given.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and relevant, offering alternative approaches to improve the model. It's helpful because it guides the authors towards more efficient methods, even though it doesn't go into detail. I think a 4 is appropriate because it's useful but could be more comprehensive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point about a missing citation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review says there's a missing citation. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? They need to add the citation. So it's actionable. But is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies adding the citation. So I think it's 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions \"the public skip-gram data set in L425.\" That's specific because it refers to a particular dataset. So grounding is good. It's fully grounded because it's clear which part is missing.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim that a citation is missing. It doesn't provide evidence or reasoning. So it's not verifiable. It's just stating a problem without supporting it, so it's 1: Unverifiable.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment points out a missing citation but doesn't suggest what to do or why it's important. It's just pointing out the issue without actionable steps. So it's not very helpful. Maybe a 2: Barely Helpful because it does identify a problem, but lacks the suggestions needed.\n\nWait, but the actionability was 3, which is somewhat actionable. Maybe I should double-check. The comment is explicit about the missing citation, so it's actionable. But it's vague on how to fix it, just says to add it. So it's somewhat actionable, not fully. So 3 makes sense.\n\nFor grounding, it's specific about the dataset, so fully grounded. Verifiability is low because it's just pointing out the issue without evidence. So 1 is correct.\n\nHelpfulness: It's better than 1 because it does identify a problem, but it doesn't help the author fix it. So 2: Barely Helpful seems right.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says it's unclear why the model doesn't fully succeed in the triangle dataset. It asks if an assumption isn't satisfied, there are learning difficulties, and suggests further comments. I think the action here is pointing out areas for improvement, but it's a bit vague. It doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done, like suggesting a particular fix or method. So, it's not explicit, which would make it implicit. Since it's vague about how to apply the suggestions, it's probably not actionable enough. I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the triangle dataset but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model it's referring to. It's too vague about the issue. There's no clear indication of a specific section or figure, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't provide enough context for the authors to pinpoint where the problem lies. So, this would be a 3 as well because it's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the model doesn't fully succeed and suggests possible issues. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to support the claim. This should be a 3 since it's somewhat verifiable but lacks key elements like examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out potential issues but doesn't offer concrete solutions or detailed suggestions. It's more of a question than a constructive comment. While it's helpful in identifying areas for improvement, it doesn't guide the authors on how to fix the problems. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully constructive. I'd rate this as 3 as well.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the necessary details or evidence to be fully actionable, grounded, verifiable, or helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the discussion on the hyperparameter \u03b3 is missing and suggests including how to set it in practice and analyzing sensitivity. It seems like it's giving a clear action, so that's explicit. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to set \u03b3 or how to analyze sensitivity. So it's explicit but vague. That should be a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"the discussion on arbitrary hyperparameter \u03b3\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It's a bit vague. It mentions \"for a given graph\" which is a bit specific, but without a clear reference, it's not fully grounded. So I'd rate this as 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the discussion is missing and suggesting improvements. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back up why this is a problem. It's a bit vague, so it's not very verifiable. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a clear issue and suggesting improvements. It's helpful because it guides the authors on what to do, even though it's a bit vague. So I'd say it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is clear but not fully meeting the higher standards, so 3s make sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the Methodology section is hard to follow and points out specific issues like confusing notation and inconsistent labels. It also suggests that the model architecture is unclear. Now, for actionability, I need to check if the review is explicit and concrete. The reviewer does suggest improvements but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. For example, they mention specific notations like $v^p_{t-1}$ not appearing in equations and labels not being a sequence. However, they don't provide clear steps on how to fix these issues. So, it's more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's not explicit, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Mostly Actionable\" because the reviewer does point out specific problems, even if the steps aren't detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the Methodology section by name, which is specific. It mentions particular elements like $v^p_{t-1}$ and labels $l_0$, $l_{t-1}$, which are unique parts of the paper. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the section and specific elements within it. The specificity comes from clearly identifying the problematic notations and labels, so this should be a high score, maybe \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that the model architecture is unclear and suggests better notation. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning to back up these claims. It's more of an opinion without evidence. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary justification. I think this would be a \"Somewhat Verifiable\" score.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out specific issues in the Methodology section and provides suggestions for improvement. It doesn't ask for clarification or raise questions, so it's helpful. However, it doesn't offer detailed guidance on how to fix the problems, so it's not the most helpful. I'd rate this as \"Mostly Helpful\" because it does identify problems and give some suggestions, just not in the most detailed way.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores should be:\n- Actionability: 4 (Mostly Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: 3 (Somewhat Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 4 (Mostly Helpful)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests simplifying descriptions, explaining the architecture and computations, and reducing certain sections. These are explicit actions the authors can take. The comment also mentions specific sections (Figure 7, Section 8, lines 39-64) which makes it clear what needs to be done. Since the actions are both explicit and detailed, this should be highly actionable. So, I think the actionability label is 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific sections and parts of the paper, like Figure 7 and Section 8, and mentions lines 39-64. This means the authors can pinpoint exactly where improvements are needed. The mention of these specific parts shows strong grounding because it's not just a general critique but targets particular elements. So, grounding_specificity should also be 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review offers suggestions but doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up the claims. It just recommends simplifying and explaining certain parts. Without supporting evidence, the claim isn't well-verified. So, this should be a lower score, maybe 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the areas needing improvement and provides specific sections to focus on. It guides the authors in making their paper more understandable without being too vague. This level of guidance is helpful, so a 5 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the clarity, specificity, and support provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests discussing the experiment results more, like concluding from the Streetview experiment. It also mentions the real-world applications but doesn't specify how to apply it. The part about computational complexity is a bit vague. So, it's explicit in pointing out areas for improvement but doesn't give clear steps on how to do that. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I think a 3 is appropriate.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the Streetview experiment and real-world applications but doesn't clearly point to specific sections or tables. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. However, it does imply specific areas, so maybe a 4? Wait, no, the definitions say 5 is fully grounded. Since it's not clearly pointing to specific parts, I'll go with 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests discussing results but doesn't provide evidence or reasoning. It also talks about computational complexity but doesn't back it up with references or logical reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which would be a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest areas for improvement and raises valid points about applications and complexity.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests placing more emphasis on prompt design and mentions that different prompts can affect performance. It doesn't specify what changes to make or how to improve the prompts. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for change but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know they need to focus on prompts, but they don't know exactly how. So, I think this is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about MenatQA and different prompts but doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs addressing. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding isn't strong because it doesn't pinpoint the issue. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that different prompts can affect performance and suggests focusing on design. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's a claim without support, so it's not very verifiable. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out an important area (prompt design) and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it's quite general and doesn't offer specific advice on what changes to make. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies a need but doesn't fully guide the authors. So, a 3 seems appropriate.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated a 3 because they're all somewhat lacking in either specificity, detail, or support.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions specific questions like how they picked 0.6 for glove embedding similarity and whether they used k-cross-validation. It also suggests trying other loss functions like mean or NDCG. These are clear actions the authors can take, so the comment is explicit. However, the suggestions are quite vague and don't provide detailed guidance on how to implement these changes. So, I think this is **2: Borderline Actionable** because it's explicit but not very detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to glove embedding similarity and suggests trying other loss functions. It doesn't mention specific sections of the paper or unique aspects, so the grounding is weak. It does, however, clearly specify what needs improvement, which makes it somewhat specific. Therefore, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for the suggestions. It just mentions trying different loss functions without backing it up. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some suggestions but they're vague and lack depth. It doesn't provide clear guidance on how to proceed, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very helpful overall. This would be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review point says that the condition \u03b7 \u2265 C\u2080 is strong and suggests comparing it with Section 4. It's explicit about the condition and provides a clear action, which is to clarify and compare. However, it doesn't specify how to do this, like suggesting a particular method or providing examples. So, it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete details. I think this falls under Mostly Actionable, which is a 4.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe review mentions Section 4 but doesn't specify exactly which part or unique aspect of the paper it refers to. It's a bit vague. However, it does clearly identify the issue with the condition, so it's grounded. Since it's not super specific but still pinpoints the area, I'd rate this as Fully Grounded and Under-Specific, which is a 4.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe comment suggests an improvement but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning. It's vague and lacks justification. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review points out a specific issue and suggests an improvement, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, though not the most detailed. So, it's Mostly Helpful, which is a 4.\n\nI think that's a balanced evaluation. The review is helpful and somewhat grounded but lacks detailed justification and specific examples, making it somewhat actionable but not fully.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the legends of tables 1, 2, and 3 should be longer and clarify whether the numbers are % errors or % correct, specifically mentioning MNIST and CIFAR. This is an explicit action because the reviewer is directly telling the authors what needs to be done. Now, is this action clear and concrete? Yes, because it specifies exactly which parts of the tables need improvement and what the numbers represent. There's no ambiguity here, so this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions tables 1, 2, and 3 by name, which is pretty specific. They also point out the need to clarify the legends, which directly relates to those tables. There's no mention of anything else, so this is fully grounded. Additionally, the comment is specific about what needs to be clarified, so it's not just general advice but directly addresses the issue in those tables. Therefore, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review doesn't make any claims or suggestions. It's just stating what should be done without providing any justification or references. So, there's no verifiable evidence here. This falls under the \"X\" category because there's no claim, just a descriptive statement.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does provide clear feedback on specific tables and what needs to be improved. It's actionable and directly tells the authors what to do. However, it doesn't go beyond that; it doesn't suggest alternative approaches or deeper improvements. So, while it's helpful, it's not the most comprehensive. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect high actionability and grounding, no verifiability, and moderate helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the concept of energy is introduced in Section 3.1 and used again in Section 5.2. It suggests refreshing the idea in Section 5.2 and provides a hint about interpreting it, like splitting a morpheme if there's high energy. It also points out that the term \"peak\" in Figure 5 isn't defined. \n\nThis seems pretty actionable. The reviewer is giving specific sections where the concept is used and suggesting where it should be revisited. They also offer a clear explanation on how to interpret high energy and identify peaks in the figure. So, the actions are explicit, and the details are concrete. I think this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Section 3.1 and specifically mentions Figure 5. It doesn't just say \"Section 5.2\" but pinpoints the exact figure. This shows that the reviewer is accurately identifying the parts of the paper, which is good grounding. They're not just making a general statement but clearly pointing to specific sections and elements. So, this should also be a high score, probably 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment about the necessity to refresh the concept of energy and providing a definition for \"peak.\" They're not citing external references or logical reasoning beyond their own understanding. However, their statements are clear and based on their own knowledge, so it's somewhat verifiable. I'm leaning towards a 3 because it's not fully supported by external evidence but is clear enough.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is very helpful. It directly points out areas where the authors can improve, suggests specific sections to revisit, and provides actionable advice on interpreting the concepts. It's clear and constructive without being overly vague. So, this should be a high score, likely a 5.\n\nOverall, the review is thorough and provides clear, actionable feedback with good grounding and verifiability, making it highly helpful to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that some details are missing, specifically about the grammar over kernels and how inference is performed. It also asks for probabilities associated with the grammar. I think this is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors what needs to be addressed. However, it doesn't provide specific instructions on how to add these details or where to look. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat explicit but vague on the implementation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out missing details about the grammar and probabilities. It doesn't explicitly name a specific part of the paper, like a section or figure, but it's clear what's missing. The comment implies the need to address these elements without naming them specifically. So, I think this is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the issue without needing more information. The specificity is good because it explains what needs to be done. Maybe a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that some details are missing and suggests specific areas to look into. It doesn't cite any external references or provide logical reasoning beyond the statements. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. I'd rate this a 3 because it has some justification but isn't fully supported.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for specific details and clarifications, which is helpful. It guides the authors on what to improve without being too vague. It's clear and actionable, so I think this deserves a 4. It's not the most detailed, but it's sufficient to be helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the title is ambiguous and suggests clarifying it to specify machine comprehension, not human reading. The action here is clear: authors need to clarify the title. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. Also, it's concrete because it tells them exactly where to make the change. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions clarifying the title but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be changed. It's a bit vague. So it's grounded because it refers to the title, but it's not specific about what part of the title needs clarification.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors lack confidence intervals and only evaluated on two datasets. It suggests improvements but doesn't specify what to do next. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issues but doesn't give clear actions. I think this is somewhat actionable but not fully detailed, so maybe a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment references specific papers, which is good. It's not just a vague statement but points to actual works. However, it doesn't explain why these references are relevant or how they apply to the current work. So, it's grounded but not fully specific. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment does make a claim by suggesting the need for confidence intervals and references. It cites specific papers, which adds credibility. But the justification is a bit brief, just listing the papers without much explanation. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully robust. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out clear issues and provides references, which is helpful. However, it doesn't suggest specific fixes or how to implement the changes. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. I'd give this a 4.\n\nWait, but for actionability, I initially thought 3, but maybe it's more actionable since it does point out specific areas. Hmm, perhaps 4.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out a specific equation and asks if the author meant t_R^m or t_R^{m-1}. It also requests a definition of t_R^m since it's used later and unclear. This is explicit because the reviewer is directly telling the author what to do. The action is clear: define t_R^m. Additionally, the reviewer provides a specific example (the equation) and asks a direct question, so the action is concrete. Therefore, this should be a high score for actionability. I think a 4 or 5 would be appropriate, but since it's a bit vague about the equation, maybe 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer refers to an unnumbered equation and specifically asks about its definition. They mention that it's used subsequently, which helps the author pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The comment is clear about the part of the paper being addressed, so this is fully grounded. The specificity comes from asking about the definition and its use, which is clear. So, this should be a high score, probably 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting a correction and asking for a definition. They provide a specific example and a logical request, which is verifiable. The reasoning is clear, and there's no need for external references, so it's somewhat verifiable but still solid. I think a 4 would be appropriate here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear and directly points out a specific issue. It asks for a definition, which is actionable.

So, it's explicit in saying what needs to be done but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the proposed method and fair policy learning but doesn't reference a specific part of the paper. It's too general, so it's not grounded. It doesn't clearly identify which section or element is being addressed.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point is asking about \u03b4 in Lemma 5. It's a direct question, so the author can identify that they need to explain what \u03b4 is. However, it doesn't provide any specific instructions on how to do that. So, it's explicit in asking for information but lacks detail on how to proceed. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear what's needed but not how to achieve it.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Lemma 5, which is a specific part of the paper. The author can pinpoint exactly where \u03b4 is mentioned. So, it's fully grounded because it clearly identifies the section being addressed. But does it specify what's wrong or missing? It just asks for an explanation, which is somewhat specific. However, since it's only asking for an explanation and not pointing out any issues, it's not fully specific. So, I think it's weakly grounded and somewhat specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment is a question, so there's no claim being made. It's just seeking information. Since there's no claim, it doesn't need to be verifiable. Therefore, it's classified as \"X\" for no claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is asking for an explanation of \u03b4 in Lemma 5. While it's clear what's being asked, it doesn't provide any specific guidance on how to improve the draft. It's just a factual question without actionable suggestions. So, it's not very helpful because the authors won't know how to apply this information to enhance their work. It's more of a descriptive comment without any actionable feedback.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 2 (Borderline Actionable)\n- Grounding_specificity: 3 (Weakly Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: X (No Claim)\n- Helpfulness: 1 (Not Helpful at All)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

However, the action is vague because it doesn't specify how to adjust the weights dynamically. The suggestion is to use dynamic weighting but doesn't provide concrete steps or references, making it somewhat actionable but not fully detailed.  \n\n2. **grounding_specificity_label**: \"5\"  \n   - The review explicitly mentions \"works in multimodal fusion\" and suggests dynamic weighting, which is a specific part of the paper. It provides a clear reference to external work, making it fully grounded and specific.  \n\n3. **verifiability_label**: \"3\"  \n   - The claim is that dynamic weighting is important, supported by references to existing literature. The reasoning is logical but lacks specific examples or detailed references, making it somewhat verifiable.  \n\n4. **helpfulness_label**: \"4\"  \n   - The review provides clear feedback on a specific issue, suggesting a meaningful improvement.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review mentions that the task loss is called L_task in the text but L_class in the figure. It suggests that the authors should be made aware of this discrepancy. This is explicit, so it's clear what needs to be done. Also, it provides a direct action, which is to inform the authors about the difference between L_task and L_class. Since it's explicit and clear, it's highly actionable. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review points out a specific issue in the text and figure, so it's fully grounded. It also clearly identifies what's wrong, which is the discrepancy between L_task and L_class. Therefore, it's both grounded and specific, so a 5 here.\n\nFor verifiability, the review makes a claim that there's a discrepancy in the notation. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's not verifiable. It just states the issue without supporting evidence. So, it should be marked as X.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a clear issue and suggests a specific action for the authors. It's direct and provides actionable feedback, which is very helpful. So, a 5 here as well.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out specific issues in the paper, like the monotonic increase in performance with \u03bb and suggests looking at smaller \u03bb values. It also points out missing variables in equations. The action is clear: the authors should investigate smaller \u03bb and check the equations. The instructions are explicit, so this is explicit actionability. Now, is it concrete? The review tells the authors exactly what to look for and what changes to make, so it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a 4 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific sections (table 1, page 3, line numbers) and specific issues (missing variables). It's not just a general critique but points to exact spots, so this is fully grounded. It also clearly specifies what needs to be addressed, so it's specific. That makes it a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests looking at smaller \u03bb values but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a suggestion without backing, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does provide some specific points but lacks a deeper analysis or justification for why smaller \u03bb is important or how it affects the results. It's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So, a 3 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment lists several points where citations are needed. It doesn't specify how to apply these suggestions, like which part of the paper needs citation or what examples to use. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for citations but doesn't give clear instructions on how to do that. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think a 4 here.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the comment mentions specific lines and areas but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper each refers to. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. Maybe a 3.\n\nMoving to **verifiability**, the comment does provide some justification by mentioning previous work and suggesting citations. However, it's not very detailed, and the reasoning isn't fully robust. It's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does point out areas needing citations and suggests improvements, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, though not perfect. So, a 4 seems right.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores should be actionability 4, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding the bottom-up method to the tables and evaluating performance on MS COCO. It's explicit about the action\u2014adding to tables and suggesting an evaluation. But it doesn't specify how to implement this, like which metrics to use or how to present the results. So it's explicit but lacks detail. I think this is a 3 because it's actionable but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions adding a reference to a specific dataset and evaluating on MS COCO. It clearly references specific parts of the paper, like Table 4 and ResNet-50, so that's full grounding. It also specifies what needs to be done, which is evaluating performance, so it's specific. That should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests including another method and evaluating on a standard dataset. It's making a claim by recommending these changes, and it's supported by logical reasoning and common knowledge about including references and evaluations. There's no mention of external references, but the reasoning is clear. So I'd rate this a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but could be more robust with examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out specific areas for improvement\u2014adding a reference and evaluating performance. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful for the authors. It doesn't seem too vague or minimal, so it's a 4. It's mostly helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing the experimental section to coordinate-aware methods like TFN or SchNet. It doesn't specify how to implement this, just that it's a good idea. So, the action is explicit\u2014compare to these methods\u2014but the implementation details are missing. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know what to do, but they don't know how exactly. So, I think this is a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but it's vague on the specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific methods (TFN, SchNet) and clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is a good point. It doesn't just refer to a general part of the paper but names specific models. So, this has strong grounding because it accurately identifies the referenced part. The specificity is also good because it clearly states what's wrong or needs improvement. Therefore, this should be a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests comparing to these methods but doesn't provide any justification or references. It just recommends the methods without supporting why they are appropriate. So, there's no claim here, or if there is, it's not justified. This falls under **X: No Claim**, meaning it doesn't meet the verifiability criteria.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest a specific improvement but doesn't explain why it's beneficial or how it helps. It's clear what needs to be done, but there's no additional guidance on how this comparison will enhance the work or any rationale behind the suggestion. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Therefore, a **4: Mostly Helpful** seems appropriate because it does provide a suggestion, but it's not fully detailed or justified.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that ProtPainter provides an empirical confirmation estimation and suggests further optimization and validation are needed. The action here is \"further optimization and validation are required.\" That's pretty explicit, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The comment tells the authors exactly what needs to be done, which is to optimize and validate. It doesn't leave room for interpretation, so it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a high score for actionability. I think a 4 or 5 would be appropriate, but since it's explicit and concrete, maybe 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"for binder design\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs improvement. It just says further optimization and validation are required. So the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or figure. It's more general, so I'd rate this as 3 because it's not fully grounded but not weak either.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment talks about \"empirical conformation estimation\" but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just suggests further work is needed without backing it up. So there's no claim here, just a suggestion, which doesn't help verify anything. This should be a low score, maybe 1 because it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out areas for improvement, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague. It doesn't specify how to optimize or validate, which could be a weakness. So while it's somewhat helpful, it's not the most detailed feedback. I'd rate this a 3 because it's helpful but not the most comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores make sense based on the explicitness, specificity, verifiability, and overall helpfulness of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review point is asking the authors to clarify how the model in Figure 7 was trained. It also questions whether changing the cycle duration would affect the adaptation time, referencing another study. \n\nFirst, is this an explicit or implicit action? The comment is directly telling the authors what to do: clarify the training method and explore the effect of cycle duration. That seems explicit. Now, is it concrete? It's giving specific areas to look into and referencing a particular study, so the authors know exactly what to do. Therefore, it's highly actionable. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to Figure 7 and mentions a specific study, Smirnakis et al. in Nature 1997. This means the authors can accurately pinpoint where to look for the information and what might be affected by the cycle duration. So, it's fully grounded and specific. That's a 5 here too.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that the model's training method and cycle duration affect adaptation. It then provides references to back up these claims. The references are specific and well-known, so the justification is solid. However, it doesn't go into detailed reasoning or examples beyond the references. So, it's mostly verifiable, which I'll rate as a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment is asking for clarification and providing a specific reference, which is helpful. It's not vague and gives the authors something to work with. It's clear and actionable, so it's quite helpful. I'd rate this a 4 because while it's helpful, it could be more detailed, but it's still good enough to be useful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a score of 5, 5, 4, and 4 respectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors need to plot a figure to support their claim. That's an explicit action, so it's clear what they should do. But the instruction says the figure should show accuracy decline over time in different settings. It doesn't specify how to create the figure or what data to use. So it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the motivation and the accuracy decline but doesn't specify which part of the paper or any unique elements. It just says \"the authors need to plot a figure.\" Without pointing to a specific section or data, this isn't fully grounded. So it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion to plot a figure, which is a claim. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It just says \"plot a figure\" without explaining why or how. So it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review gives a clear task but doesn't explain why it's important or how it helps the authors. It's somewhat helpful because it points out what needs to be done, but it lacks the reasoning behind it. So it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests explaining the definition of excessive risk and how to calculate it. It also asks about the optimal solution \u03b8* and its relation to the loss function. Additionally, it questions whether excessive risk values are comparable across groups and why they're used for fairness. These are clear questions that the authors can address, so the action is explicit. The instructions given are specific and direct, so I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while the actions are clear, they might be a bit vague on how detailed the explanation should be.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like Figure 3 and 7, and refers to the loss function and \u03b8*. It doesn't make any general comments, so the grounding is explicit. The specificity is also good because it clearly states what needs to be addressed, like the definition and calculation of excessive risk. There's no mention of external work, so it's not applicable here. I'd rate this as **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims about excessive risk being a good representation for fairness. The justification provided is that it's a common practice, which is a form of common knowledge. However, it doesn't provide specific references or examples, so it's somewhat verifiable. I think this falls under **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because while the reasoning is there, it's not as robust as it could be.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is quite detailed, addressing multiple areas the authors might be unsure about. It provides clear questions and explanations, which should be helpful. However, it's not the most comprehensive, so it's **4: Mostly Helpful**. It gives enough guidance but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the review point's content.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests including experiments with GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4. That's a clear action. It tells the authors exactly what to do, which is good. But does it give detailed instructions on how to implement this change? The comment just suggests the switch but doesn't specify how to conduct the experiments or what data to collect. So, it's explicit about the action but lacks detail. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done but doesn't provide the specifics on how to do it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions GPT-3.5 as a more affordable option. It doesn't explicitly point to a specific part of the paper, like a particular section or figure. It's a general suggestion without pinning down exactly where the change should be made or what aspect of the experiment should be evaluated. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. However, it does specify what needs to be addressed, which is the switch to GPT-3.5. So, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part but is clear about what needs to be done.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests GPT-3.5 as an alternative. It's a subjective opinion about the cost-effectiveness of GPT-3.5. There's no supporting evidence or justification provided for why GPT-3.5 is a better option. It's just a recommendation without backing. So, this is \"Unverifiable\" because there's no logical reasoning or references to back up the suggestion.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is suggesting a change that could be beneficial, but it's quite vague. It tells the authors to include experiments with GPT-3.5 but doesn't explain why this is better or how it will help. It's helpful in that it points out a potential improvement, but it lacks depth and clarity. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it does provide a suggestion but doesn't elaborate on the benefits or the specifics of the change.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, justification, and detail provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review point is asking for examples of \"unreliable neighbors\" between lines 170 to 171. It's a direct question, so the action is explicit. However, the instruction is quite vague. It doesn't specify what exactly to look for or how to identify unreliable neighbors. So, while it's clear that the author needs to do something, the method isn't detailed. That makes it borderline actionable because it's explicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is pointing out a specific part of the paper, lines 170-171, so the grounding is clear. The comment is specific about the section it's addressing. However, it doesn't explain what \"unreliable neighbors\" mean in that context. It just asks for examples without elaborating, so it's specific about the section but not about the issue itself. That makes it weakly grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a question asking for examples, which doesn't present a claim. It's more of a factual statement, so it doesn't require verification. Therefore, it's classified as \"X\" with no claim and thus not verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a potential weakness in the paper by asking for examples of something the author might have missed. It provides a clear area for improvement but doesn't offer detailed guidance or suggest specific changes. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an area for improvement, but it's incomplete in terms of actionable suggestions.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are 2 for actionability, 3 for grounding_specificity, X for verifiability, and 3 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the novelty is limited and points out that tighter confidence intervals (CIs) with fine-tuning are expected. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving a direct action, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this falls under a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about task-specific fine-tuning and generalizability but doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper. It's a bit vague, so I'd rate this a 4 because it's grounded but not entirely specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides some reasoning about expected results but doesn't cite external references or give a clear justification. It's somewhat verifiable but not fully. So, a 3 here makes sense.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some feedback on novelty and provides a reason for the critique, which is helpful. However, it's not very detailed and doesn't suggest specific improvements. So, it's somewhat helpful, which I'll rate as a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review point provides clear, specific, and justifiable feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests splitting the tables into two each, grouping SFII and SPDI columns. It's explicit about the action\u2014splitting the tables. But it doesn't specify how to do that, like whether to add headers or rearrange columns. So it's clear what needs to be done, but the instructions are vague. I think this is **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's clear what to do, but not exactly how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions tables 4 and 5 but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. It's a bit unclear, but since it's a table split, it's somewhat implied. So I'd say **4: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the tables, which are part of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the suggestion is about readability. There's no claim here\u2014it's just a recommendation. So it's a normal statement, which means **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear and directly points out an improvement. It guides the authors without being too vague. So it's **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and actionable, though maybe a bit too straightforward.\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the work builds on Zemel et al. (2013) and explains the differences, but it could improve by making comparisons more systematic, specifically by comparing the best performance of each method. \n\nLooking at the criteria for actionability, it's about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer suggests comparing the best performances, which is explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do this? It says \"more systematic with respect to the tuning of each method--i.e. compare the best performance of each.\" It's a bit vague on how to implement this, like what specific tunings to use or how to structure the comparisons. So it's explicit in the action but vague in the details. That would fall under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear that they need to compare best performances but doesn't give precise steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Zemel et al. (2013) and mentions comparisons. It doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper or what aspect of the comparison. It's a bit vague. So the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or issue. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the work but doesn't clearly specify what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests making comparisons more systematic. It's a claim that this improvement is needed. Now, is this claim well-supported? The reviewer doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion itself. It's a judgment about the current method's lack of systematic comparisons. So it's a claim without much justification, making it **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some reasoning but it's not robust or detailed.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a need for more systematic comparisons but doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to achieve this. It's clear that the authors need to improve, but the suggestion is quite broad. It's helpful in that it identifies an area for improvement, but it's not very detailed or actionable. So it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it gives a meaningful suggestion but doesn't elaborate much on how to implement it.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated a 3 because they all fall into the middle category where the review is clear in pointing out issues or suggestions but lacks the depth or specificity needed for full effectiveness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
