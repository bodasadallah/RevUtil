Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors selected sentences from a subset of Li et al. (2019a)'s dataset. It suggests revising the description to mention Li et al. earlier. This is explicit, so it's clear what needs to be done. The action is to revise the description, and it's concrete because it specifies mentioning the dataset. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Li et al. (2019a) by name, which is a specific reference. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is revising the description. Therefore, it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests citing Li et al. (2019a), which is an external reference. This provides justification, so it's verifiable. It's not just a claim without support, so it's at least somewhat verifiable. However, it's not fully robust because it only mentions citing the dataset, which is a bit vague. So, I'd rate it as somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions to revise the description and cites a specific reference. This is actionable and constructive, so it's highly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at a high level, except maybe verifiability which is somewhat. But since it's better than unverifiable, I'll stick with somewhat.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Table 4 needs a little more clarification, what splits are used for obtaining the ATIS numbers?\" I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what needs to be done. It doesn't require them to infer from the comment. The action is clear: clarify Table 4. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies exactly what they need to do\u2014clarify the splits used for ATIS numbers. So, it's not just a vague suggestion but a clear instruction. Therefore, I'd rate this as 4 for actionability because it's explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"Table 4\" and asks about the splits. It doesn't refer to any specific part of the methodology or data, but it does point to a specific table. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinning down a unique element or section beyond just mentioning the table. However, it does specify what needs to be addressed, which is the splits for ATIS numbers. So, it's somewhat grounded but not fully. I think a 3 here makes sense because it's not fully grounded but does address the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it suggests an improvement (clarifying Table 4). Now, is this claim supported? The comment doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why clarifying Table 4 is necessary or helpful. It just states the need. So, there's no supporting reasoning or references, making it unverifiable. Therefore, the verifiability label is X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific area for improvement and asks the authors to clarify. It's clear and actionable, so it should be helpful. However, it's quite brief and doesn't offer many specifics beyond asking for clarification. It might be helpful for the authors to know where the issue lies, but it doesn't provide much beyond that. So, I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat helpful but could be expanded for more guidance.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"both tasks\": antecedent missing. It mentions checking references for format, like Grice, Sorower et al, and the verbnet reference. The comment is explicit about the action needed, which is checking the references. It doesn't just suggest; it clearly states what to do. Now, is it explicit or implicit? Since it tells the authors exactly what to do, that's explicit. Next, is it concrete? It tells them to check the format, but it doesn't specify how to do that, like whether to use a particular tool or method. So, it's explicit but not entirely concrete. Wait, but the user's initial thought was 5, which is highly actionable. That would require the action to be both explicit and concrete. Hmm, maybe I should reconsider. It's explicit about the action but vague on the method. So perhaps it's 4, mostly actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper is missing the antecedent. It just says \"both tasks\" and mentions checking references. So the grounding is weak because it can't confidently identify the referenced part. It's not fully grounded. Specificity is also low because it doesn't explain what exactly is wrong with the references. So, this would be weakly grounded and not specific. The initial thought was 5, but that's not right. Maybe 3, somewhat grounded and specific? Wait, no, it's weakly grounded. So perhaps 2, weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim by suggesting that the references need checking. It's supported by examples like Grice, Sorower et al, and verbnet. These are well-known references, so it's using common knowledge. The justification is clear and provides specific examples. So this should be fully verifiable. The initial thought was 3, but it's actually 5 because it's thoroughly supported.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment is clear about what needs to be done but doesn't elaborate on why it's important or how it affects the paper. It's specific but lacks depth. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully. The initial thought was 4, which seems right because it's helpful but could be expanded.\n\nWait, but for actionability, I thought it was explicit but vague. So maybe it's 4, mostly actionable. Grounding is weak, so 2. Verifiability is 5, fully verifiable. Helpfulness is 4, somewhat helpful.\n\nBut the initial evaluation was 5,4,3,4. Maybe I need to adjust. Let me think again.\n\nActionability: The comment is explicit about the action (check references) but doesn't specify how. So it's explicit but not fully concrete. Maybe 4.\n\nGrounding: Doesn't specify which part is missing, so weak grounding. Maybe 2.\n\nVerifiability: Well-supported with examples, so 5.\n\nHelpfulness: Clear but lacks depth, so 4.\n\nSo the final scores would be actionability 4, grounding 2, verifiability 5, helpfulness 4. But the initial output was 5,4,3,4. Maybe I was overcomplicating grounding. It's weakly grounded because it mentions checking references, which is a general area, but doesn't pin down the exact part. So maybe 3? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's 2 because it's not fully confident in identifying the part. I think I'll stick with the initial evaluation.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the abstract could be made better by adding \"gold answers\" as an example of inconsistency in model rankings. It's explicit about suggesting an action, which is good. However, the action isn't very detailed. The comment says \"could potentially be made even better\" but doesn't specify how. So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the method isn't outlined. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"the inconsistency, such as models get ranked differently.\" It mentions an example but doesn't tie it back to a specific part of the paper. It's a bit vague about where this inconsistency occurs. So, the grounding isn't very specific because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. I think this is a 3 because it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding \"gold answers\" as an example. It's making a claim that models are inconsistent, but it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. There's no logical reasoning or external sources cited, so it's not verifiable. This should be a 3 since it's somewhat verifiable if it had more justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a weakness in the abstract and suggests an improvement. It's clear and provides a specific example, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into much detail about how to implement the change or what exactly needs to be added. It's somewhat helpful because it does identify an issue and offer a suggestion, but it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback. So, a 3 here makes sense.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated a 3 because they either have some issues with clarity, specificity, or detail, but they still provide meaningful feedback overall.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding some discussions on the convergence of the joint learning process between RNN and CopyRNN. It also asks readers to understand how stable points in probabilistic metric space are obtained, otherwise, repeating results might be tough. So, the action is clear: add more discussions. But the instruction part is a bit vague. It tells the authors what to do but doesn't specify exactly how to implement it. For example, should they add a section, provide proofs, or something else? Without more details, the action is explicit but the method is unclear. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because the action is clear, but it's vague on how to apply it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the convergence of the joint learning process and the stable points in probabilistic metric space. It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper this refers to, like a specific section or figure. It's a bit unclear, but it does point to specific areas within the paper. So, I'd say it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it can't be precisely identified but clearly points to parts of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the importance of discussing convergence and stable points. It's suggesting that readers might find it tough to repeat the results without this information. However, there's no external reference or logical reasoning provided to back up why this is a significant issue. It's more of a judgment without solid justification. So, this would be **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some reasoning but lacks specific evidence or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out the need for more discussion on a specific technical aspect, which is important for readers to understand the results. However, it doesn't provide detailed suggestions on what exactly to add or how to improve the discussion. It's clear that more discussion is needed but doesn't give concrete steps. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful** because it does inform the authors of an area to improve but doesn't fully guide them on how to do it.\n\nOverall, each aspect is clear but lacks the depth or specificity that would make the review fully actionable, grounded, verifiable, or helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"In figure 5, the y-axis label may use 'Exact Match ratio' directly.\" I think this is an explicit action because it directly tells the author what to do. The author can go to figure 5 and check the y-axis label. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly what to look for. So this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment points out an issue in figure 5, which is specific. It's not a general statement; it's about a particular part of the paper. So the author can pinpoint where the problem is. That's full grounding. Also, it's specific because it mentions the y-axis label and the term \"Exact Match ratio.\" So grounding_specificity is 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the y-axis label might use that term. But there's no justification or support provided. It's just a suggestion without backing it up with reasoning or references. So it's unverifiable. I'll give it a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does provide a specific suggestion, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague. It doesn't explain why this is a problem or how it affects the paper. It's somewhat helpful because it gives a direction, but it lacks depth. So I think helpfulness is a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a figure and clarifying the input embeddings. It tells the authors exactly what to do, which is good. The actions are explicit, and the details are concrete. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the Lample et al. model and specifically refers to Figure 3, KNs in source and English. This is pretty specific. The authors are told exactly where to add something and what to clarify. So, this should be fully grounded and specific. Another 5 seems right.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points out a specific issue (using word embeddings) and references an external work (Lample et al.). It's clear and provides a logical reason, so it's well-supported. There's no mention of needing more evidence or examples, so it's fully verifiable. A 5 here fits.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the changes needed and provides specific suggestions. It's actionable and directly addresses the authors' needs. While it could be expanded, it's already quite helpful. So, a 4 seems appropriate because it's mostly helpful but not the highest.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out two specific issues, which is good. It tells the authors exactly what needs to be improved. The first point is about the pooling method, and the second is about equation (7). Both are clear and direct. The suggestions are explicit, so the authors know exactly where to focus. There's no ambiguity here. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper\u2014line 397 and equation (7). It's clear which sections are being addressed, so the authors can easily pinpoint where to make changes. The comments are specific about the issues, not just vague generalizations. Therefore, this is fully grounded and specific. Another 5 for this aspect.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review provides clear justifications. It explains why the pooling method is important and suggests looking into equation (7) for clarity. It also points out that the left-hand side of the equation should be a conditional probability, which is a logical point. These explanations are sufficient and logical, so the claims are well-supported. This should be a 5 as well.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is very helpful. It directly addresses two clear issues, provides actionable suggestions, and even points out a potential logical error in the equation. This gives the authors a lot of concrete feedback to improve their work. It's thorough and constructive, so a 5 here is appropriate.\n\nOverall, each aspect is scored a 5 because the review is explicit, specific, well-supported, and highly helpful to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**:\nThe review mentions that the hypotheses aren't phrased optimally but doesn't provide specific actions or suggestions on how to improve them. It points out that the paper doesn't study these hypotheses and suggests the authors should go deeper. However, it's vague about what changes to make. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does suggest an improvement but doesn't specify how. So, the actionability label should be 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**:\nThe review refers to the hypotheses by their line numbers (078-086) and mentions the need for deeper discussion. This is explicit about which part of the paper is addressed and clearly states what needs improvement. Therefore, it's fully grounded and specific. The grounding_specificity label is 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**:\nThe review contains a claim that the hypotheses aren't phrased optimally and that the paper doesn't study them. It provides some reasoning but lacks specific references or examples. It's somewhat justified but not fully robust. So, the verifiability label is 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\nThe review is clear about pointing out weaknesses and suggesting improvements. It provides enough guidance for the authors to consider changes, even though it could be more detailed. This makes it mostly helpful. The helpfulness label is 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable, fully grounded and specific, somewhat verifiable, and mostly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It's explicit about the action, which is good. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement it or what changes to make. So it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable,\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Uto et al. (2020) and their feature set. That's pretty specific. It clearly identifies the referenced work and the specific feature set, so this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific,\" which is a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review cites Uto et al. (2020) and mentions a QWK score. This provides a reference and some justification, but it's not very detailed. It lacks specific examples or deeper explanation, so I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Verifiable,\" which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review suggests a possible improvement by referencing another study. It's helpful because it points out a potential area for improvement. However, it's somewhat vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance.

This is an explicit action, as the reviewer is directly instructing the authors to add a specific element. However, the action lacks concrete details on how to implement this change, such as where in the table or what exact modifications to make. Therefore, it is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because the action is clear but not detailed enough.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label:**  \n   The reviewer mentions \"Table 1\" specifically, which clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed. Additionally, they suggest including a \"hard prompt baseline,\" which is a specific instruction about what needs to be added. This provides clear grounding and specificity, so it is **3: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\n3. **Verifiability Label:**  \n   The review point is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding experiments with wider backbones, which is a clear action. But it doesn't specify how to implement this, like whether they should use the same training setup or if they need to adjust hyperparameters. So it's explicit in what needs to be done but lacks detail on how. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific methods (MoCo, SimCLR) and specific wider backbones (ResNet50x2 and ResNet50x4). It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, so that's fully grounded. Also, it specifies what needs to be addressed in that part, which adds specificity. So this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the experimental comparisons are insufficient and suggests improvements.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The comment says, \"the callout to table 5 should go to table 3, instead.\" That's pretty specific about which table to move, so the action is clear. Then, it mentions, \"figure 6 callout is not directing properly.\" It points out an issue and suggests a fix, which is explicit. I don't see any vague parts here, so I think this is **actionable**. But is it explicit or implicit? Since it's giving a specific correction, I'd say it's explicit. So, it's not 1, which is unactionable. It's more than 2, which is borderline. So, probably a 3 or 4. Since it's clear and direct, I'll go with **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment talks about moving a callout from table 5 to 3 and mentions figure 6. It's specific about the tables, so the grounding is good. It doesn't just say \"the paper\" but refers to specific sections. The specificity is clear because it's pointing out exact issues. So, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's both specific and accurately pinpointing the parts.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that table 5 should be moved and that figure 6's callout is improper. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating opinions without supporting evidence. So, it's not fully verifiable. It's more of a claim without backing, so I'd rate this as **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does identify two issues and provides specific suggestions. However, it's quite brief and doesn't elaborate on why these changes are necessary or how they improve the paper. It lacks depth, so while it's helpful, it's not the most helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests more analysis on the performance trends of increasing model capacity in ViT (DeiT) in Figure 3. It also disagrees with the authors' viewpoint about CNNs and ViTs benefiting similarly from increased capacity. It points out that DeiT-B and DeiT-T don't outperform DeiT-S in certain datasets, and adding 0.1% doesn't matter, but CNNs do better. \n\nThis seems like a clear action, which is to recommend more analysis. However, the action is a bit vague. It doesn't specify how to perform this analysis or what exactly to look for. So, it's explicit in stating the action but not clear on the implementation. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific figures (Figure 3) and specific datasets (APTOS2019, ISIC2019, CheXpert). It also references the impact of adding 0.1% in model capacity. This shows that the review is grounded because it accurately points to the relevant parts of the paper and provides specific examples. So, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that DeiT-B and DeiT-T don't outperform DeiT-S, and that adding 0.1% isn't significant. It also suggests that CNNs perform better. The justification is that DeiT-B and DeiT-T don't outperform in the mentioned datasets, and the improvement from 0.1% isn't significant. This is logical reasoning and references specific data points, so it's **Mostly Verifiable** because it's well-supported but could be more detailed.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides specific recommendations and disagreements, which is helpful. It suggests more analysis and points out discrepancies in the authors' claims. However, it doesn't offer a lot of depth or alternative suggestions. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful** because it's clear and actionable but could be expanded for more comprehensive feedback.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says the paper is not difficult to follow but mentions several places that might cause confusion. I think the comment is pointing out areas that need improvement, so that's an action. But it doesn't specify what needs to be done, like suggesting edits or clarifications. It's vague about how to fix those confusing parts. So, it's not fully actionable because it lacks detail on the implementation. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"several places that might cause confusion\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper. It's too vague about the exact sections or elements needing improvement. Without pointing to specific areas, the authors can't pinpoint where to focus their edits. So, this is **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**, which is a **3**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the paper isn't hard to follow but doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just an opinion without justification. There's no logical reasoning or external sources cited, so it's not verifiable. This should be a **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does identify areas for improvement, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking the authors to clarify how their bilinear layer differs from others. It's a good question, but it's pretty open-ended. The authors might not know exactly what to focus on. It doesn't give specific actions or steps to take, so it's not very actionable. It's more of a suggestion rather than a clear instruction. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does ask for clarification, which is an action, but it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review is asking about differences from other approaches, specifically mentioning billinear pooling and Hadarmard product. It's clear which parts of the paper it's referring to, so the grounding is good. Then, it's asking about the compression using Equation (3), which is a specific part. So, the specificity is also good here. I'd rate this as **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to the sections and clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting that the authors should clarify certain aspects. It's not a factual statement but an opinion. However, it's a straightforward claim without needing much justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable. I think this should be **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it's a claim but lacks deeper support or examples.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for clarifications on specific points. It's helpful because it guides the authors to improve their work, but it's quite vague. It doesn't provide detailed suggestions or ask for specific changes. So, it's somewhat helpful. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does provide some guidance but isn't as detailed or specific as it could be.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review point meets the criteria for each category.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the novelty is limited and points out similarities with previous works. It also suggests that the group attention design is related to ResNeSt but doesn't discuss this in the paper. However, it doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They need to address these similarities and possibly improve upon them. So, the action is implicit because the authors have to infer what needs to be done. Since it's not explicit, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 2 because it's somewhat implied but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about previous works [1,2,3] and ResNeSt [4], but it doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper this applies to. It mentions the group attention design being similar but doesn't point to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pinpointing the issue. It's more general, so I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review does provide some justification by citing previous works and explaining the similarities. However, it doesn't give specific references or detailed reasoning. It's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. So, a 3 here makes sense.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some useful feedback by pointing out limitations and similarities with other works. It does suggest areas for improvement, which is helpful. However, it's not very detailed, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not the most comprehensive. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is somewhat addressed but not fully detailed, leading to a 3 in each category.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests a specific action, pointing out that the cosine similarity between two networks is high and asks to illustrate the latter loss term. That's explicit, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The comment tells the authors exactly what to do: illustrate the loss term. It doesn't leave room for interpretation, so it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"the latter loss term of Eqn 13.\" This is a specific reference to a part of the paper, so the grounding is strong. It clearly points to a specific element without needing further clarification. Therefore, grounding_specificity should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the cosine similarity will be high because the preactivation values are the same. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states an opinion without supporting evidence. So, this is unverifiable, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does suggest an improvement, asking the authors to illustrate a specific point. However, it's vague about why this is important or how it helps. It doesn't provide much depth or context, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. Therefore, helpfulness should be a 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests comparing the paper's approach with TTA methods but doesn't specify how. It says, \"how to prove that data processing is superior to model parameter adjustment?\" This is a good start because it gives a clear action, but the instruction is a bit vague. The authors need to know exactly what experiments to run to compare the two methods. So, it's explicit in asking for a comparison but lacks the details on how to conduct it. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but not how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions TTA methods like [A-B] and talks about their focus on model parameters versus the paper's input data processing. It clearly references specific methods and explains the difference in focus. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the relevant part of the paper and explains the issue. Therefore, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that data processing is superior to model adjustments. It suggests comparing through experiments, which is a logical reasoning. However, it doesn't provide specific references or examples to back up this claim. It's clear and logical but lacks supporting evidence. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does suggest a comparison based on experiments, which is helpful. It points out a specific area for improvement and asks for evidence, which is actionable. However, it doesn't provide detailed guidance on what experiments to conduct or how to analyze the results. It's clear and provides direction but could be more detailed. So, it's **Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is clear but lacks some specifics in actionability and verifiability, and it's quite helpful overall.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"4. Section 3.2.1: The first expression for J (\u03b8) is incorrect, which should be Q(s_t^0, \u03c0_\u03b8(s_t^0))].\" It mentions that the expression is incorrect and provides the correct one. That seems like a clear action. But is it explicit or implicit? I think it's explicit because it directly states the correction. Now, is it concrete? It tells the author exactly where the error is and what the correct expression should be. So, it's both explicit and concrete. That should be a high score for actionability, maybe 5. But the user's initial response gave it a 3. Hmm, maybe I should double-check.\n\nWait, the user's initial response was 3. Let me think again. The comment is explicit about the section and the correction, but does it give enough guidance on how to fix it? It just says the correct expression, but doesn't explain how to apply it. So maybe it's not as concrete as I thought. So perhaps it's 3 because it's explicit but lacks detailed guidance on implementation.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review points out an issue in Section 3.2.1 and specifies the exact expression. It mentions the section and the formula, which is pretty specific. So the grounding is strong because it accurately refers to the section and the formula. The specificity is also high because it clearly states what's wrong and what should replace it. So this should be a 5. The initial response was 5, which makes sense.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim that the expression is incorrect and provides the correct one. It doesn't offer any justification or references. It just states the correction. So there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. Therefore, the verifiability score should be 1. The initial response was 1, which aligns with this reasoning.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out an error and provides the correct expression. It's clear and actionable, so it should be helpful. However, it doesn't explain why the original expression was wrong or how it affects the overall work. It's somewhat helpful because it gives a specific correction, but it's not the most detailed. So a 3 seems appropriate. The initial response was 3, which fits.\n\nSo, after reconsidering each aspect, I think the initial evaluations are accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**:\n- The review mentions specific references like \"Osawa et al. (2019)\" and \"ICML 2020\", which are concrete and specific. It also points out issues with capitalization in the text, which is a clear action for the authors to take. The mention of \"p. 13, supplement, Fig.\" provides a precise location, making it actionable. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**:\n- The review references specific papers and publication venues, which clearly identifies the parts of the paper being discussed. It also mentions specific formatting issues, which are grounded in the text. The mention of \"p. 13, supplement, Fig.\" is explicit and specific. Therefore, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**:\n- The review contains claims about the need for capitalization fixes and references to specific papers. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for these claims. It just states what needs to be done without backing it up. So, this is unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\n- The review offers clear suggestions about capitalization and references specific papers, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any reasoning or justification for why these changes are necessary. While it's somewhat helpful, it lacks the depth needed for full helpfulness. So, it's probably a 4.\n\nWait, but the initial evaluation said helpfulness is 5. Maybe because the suggestions are clear and actionable, even without justification, it's still highly helpful. So, I'll stick with 5 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out missing parameters and asks about the model and lambda values, but it's vague on how to improve the draft. It doesn't specify actions like adding details or explaining choices, so it's not explicit. It's also not concrete because it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. So, it's somewhere between 2 and 3. I think 3 because it's explicit in pointing out issues but lacks detail on how to fix them.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parameters and model choices, so it's grounded. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, which is good. It also asks about the selection process, which adds specificity. So, this should be a higher score. I'll give it 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or references. It just asks questions without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable at all. I'll label this as X because there's no claim or supporting information.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out specific issues but doesn't offer solutions or guidance on how to address them. It's clear and identifies areas for improvement, but without concrete suggestions, it's somewhat helpful. I'll rate this a 3 because it's helpful but not entirely comprehensive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors should clarify the distinction between weak and semi-supervised training and rename a column. It also proposes creating two new columns to explain the data used. This seems like a clear action, so it's explicit. The instructions are specific about renaming and adding columns, so it's concrete. I think this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like Table 1 and the proposed framework row. It clearly points out what needs to be addressed, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is high because it tells exactly where the issue is and what needs to be done. So, I'll give it a 5 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a clear explanation of what the changes are and why they're needed. It doesn't just suggest changes but also gives reasoning, so it's well-supported. Maybe a 4 because it's thorough but could be a bit more detailed, but I think 4 is okay.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is very specific about what needs to be done, both in terms of renaming and adding columns. It offers clear and actionable feedback, which is exactly what helps authors improve. So, this should be a 5 for helpfulness.\n\nI think each aspect is pretty high, so the scores should all be 5 except maybe verifiability, which I'm a bit unsure about. But since it's well-supported, I'll stick with 4 for verifiability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions NCNet and Sparse NCNet, but it doesn't specify what the shortcomings are or how to fix them. It just says the contributions are small and mostly good engineering, but doesn't give concrete actions for the authors. So, it's not actionable because there's no clear guidance on what to do next. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about NCNet and Sparse NCNet without pointing out exactly which part of the paper it's referring to. It's vague about what's wrong or how to improve. So, the grounding isn't specific because it doesn't clearly identify the section or issue. This also scores a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for its claims. It just states that the contributions are small and that it's hard to differentiate from predecessors. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. That's another 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is somewhat vague and doesn't offer clear suggestions. It mentions the contributions but doesn't explain why they're problematic or how to address them. This makes it not very helpful because the authors don't get actionable feedback.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that \"semantic\" segmentation isn't low-level because each pixel has categories. It suggests removing statements about semantic segmentation. Explicitly, it tells the authors what to do\u2014remove certain parts. That's direct, so it's explicit. It also gives clear instructions on how to implement it, like specifying pixel categories. So, it's both explicit and concrete. That should be a high score, maybe 5. But wait, the initial assessment said 3. Hmm, maybe because it's a bit vague on the exact removal? Or perhaps it's clear enough. I think 5 makes sense here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions that semantic segmentation is low-level because of pixel categories. It's clear which part is being addressed\u2014specifically semantic segmentation. It doesn't just say it's low-level; it explains why. So, it's fully grounded and specific. That should be a 5, but the initial assessment was 3. Maybe because it's a bit redundant? Or perhaps the grounding is strong but the specificity could be better? I'm a bit confused here. I think it's fully grounded and specific, so 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that semantic segmentation is low-level because each pixel has categories. It's making a claim that semantic segmentation is low-level, and it's supported by the fact that each pixel has categories. This is logical and well-supported with common knowledge. So, it's fully verifiable, which should be a 5. The initial assessment was 3, so maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the reasoning is too straightforward? I'm not sure, but I think 5 is correct.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review clearly points out an issue and suggests a solution. It's specific about what needs to be removed and why. This should be highly helpful because it guides the authors directly. So, a 5 makes sense here. The initial assessment was 3, so maybe it's because it's a bit too direct? I'm not sure, but I think 5 is appropriate.\n\nWait, but the initial assessment was all 3s. Maybe I'm overestimating. Let me think again. Actionability: It's explicit and concrete, so 5. Grounding: Fully grounded and specific, 5. Verifiability: Fully verifiable, 5. Helpfulness: Highly helpful, 5. So, I think the initial assessment might have been incorrect. I'll go with 5s for all.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

It then asks how one constructs images for a clean exemplar manifold for a non-stochastic network and how the denominator in Figure 2.c is computed for ResNet50 and ATResNet50. \n\nI think the action here is clear: the authors need to explain how to construct these clean manifolds and compute the denominator. However, the explanation is vague. It doesn't provide specific steps or examples, so the authors might not know exactly what to do. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. So I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific sections of the paper, like lines 182-183 and Figure 2.c, which shows that it's grounded. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is how to construct the clean manifolds and compute the denominator. So the grounding is strong because it references specific parts of the paper, and it's clear what's being discussed. I'd give this a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the authors need to explain how to construct the clean manifolds and compute the denominator. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. The comment is vague and doesn't give any references or logical reasoning to back up the claim. So this would be **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does ask specific questions, which is helpful, but it's vague. The authors might not get much out of it because they don't know exactly what to do. It's somewhat helpful but not very detailed or constructive. So I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that originality is limited because the main idea of variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving them an explicit action or suggestion. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions that variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. But it doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to or provide any examples. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issues are. This means it's not grounded. I'll give it a 1 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that variable splitting isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to support these claims. Without justification, it's hard for the authors to verify if this is accurate or relevant. So, it's not very verifiable. I'll rate this as 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that the main idea isn't new and the algorithm isn't new. While this gives the authors some context, it doesn't offer specific suggestions or actionable steps. Without clear guidance, the feedback isn't very helpful. I'll rate this as 1.\n\nSo, all four aspects are rated as 1 because the review point doesn't provide enough explicit information, grounding, verifiability, or actionable suggestions for the authors to improve their work.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that an ablation study is missing and suggests improvements, but it's quite vague. It doesn't specify exactly what changes should be made or how to implement them. So, it's not explicit enough. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does suggest an action but doesn't give clear details. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out the missing ablation study but doesn't clearly identify which specific part of the paper this refers to. It talks about the RBF kernel's sigma and equation (7)'s parameters but doesn't pin it down to a section or figure. So, it's not fully grounded. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the missing ablation study causing confusion and extra experimentation. It provides some suggestions but lacks specific references or logical reasoning. It's somewhat justified but not fully verifiable. So, I'll assign a 3 here too.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some meaningful feedback about the missing study and suggests improvements. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance. It's somewhat helpful but not entirely comprehensive. I'll rate this a 3 as well.\n\nOverall, the review is clear in pointing out issues but lacks the specifics and details needed for the authors to act effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says the paper was hard to follow and the author read it multiple times but still had trouble with the experimental procedures and evaluations. It doesn't suggest any specific changes or actions to take. So, it's not giving the author a clear direction on what to fix. That means it's not actionable. So, actionability should be 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions the paper was hard to follow but doesn't specify which part, like which section or figure, is the issue. It's too vague. The author can't pinpoint where the problem is, so grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the problematic part. So, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review states that the paper was hard to follow but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is an issue. There's no reference to standards, practices, or external literature to support this claim. So, it's not verifiable. Verifiability_label is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem but doesn't offer any specific suggestions or details on how to improve the paper. It's vague and lacks guidance. Therefore, it's not helpful at all. Helpfulness_label is 1.\n\nSo, all four aspects are scored as 1 because the review point doesn't provide clear, specific, or justifiable feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests looking into generalizing results to other models and includes an example for GPT-2. It's explicit about the action, which is good. But it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to generalize or what changes to make. So, it's not fully actionable but still pretty clear. I think this should be a 5 because it's explicit, even if the details are a bit broad.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific models like GPT-2 and different architectures, which is good. It's clear about which parts of the paper it's addressing, so the grounding is solid. It also provides a specific example, which helps the authors know exactly what to look into. I'd rate this a 5 because it's both grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the results should be generalized, but it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to back this up. It just suggests improvements without supporting the claim. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary justification. I think a 3 is appropriate here because there's some justification but not enough to make it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation and provides a specific example, which is helpful. It guides the authors on what to investigate but doesn't go into too much detail. It's clear and actionable, so it's quite helpful. I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded for more depth.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, each aspect gets a score based on how well the review point fulfills that criterion.\n</think>\n\n**Evaluation Summary:**\n\n- **Actionability**: 5  \n  The review is explicit about the action but lacks specific details, making it highly actionable.\n\n- **Grounding Specificity**: 5  \n  The review clearly identifies specific models and architectures, providing solid grounding and specificity.\n\n- **Verifiability**: 3  \n  The review makes a claim but lacks supporting evidence, making it somewhat verifiable.\n\n- **Helpfulness**: 4  \n  The review is clear and actionable, guiding the authors effectively but could be expanded for more detail.\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors need to add two graphs. It also raises a question about whether performance improvements are due to network design or ImageNet characteristics. The action is clear: add the graphs. But the instructions say that explicit actions are better. Here, the action is explicit, but it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to add the graphs or what data to use. So it's somewhat vague. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable,\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific things like T vs number of images and Expectation(T) over ImageNet. It also refers to network design and ImageNet redundancies. The authors can pinpoint exactly where to focus, so this is fully grounded. Also, it clearly explains what's wrong, which makes it specific. So this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting the authors analyze whether ImageNet redundancies affect performance. It's providing some reasoning but not a lot of references or examples. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth. So I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out specific areas the authors need to improve and even suggests what kind of analysis to perform. It's clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful. I'll give this a 4.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Let me just double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that using volumetric representation isn't novel and mentions VolumeDeform [1]. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next or how to apply this information. So, it's not giving them actionable steps. That means it's not actionable at all, so I'd rate it as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to VolumeDeform by citation but doesn't specify exactly where or how it applies. It's a bit vague about the part of the paper it's addressing. So, the grounding isn't fully there, but it's not completely weak either. I think a 3 makes sense here because it partially identifies the referenced work but doesn't clearly pinpoint the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions a specific citation but doesn't provide any explanation or reasoning why VolumeDeform's approach is relevant or how it applies to the task. There's no justification or examples given, so it's not very verifiable. I'd rate this a 3 as well because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks key elements.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that it's not a novel idea and references another work but doesn't offer clear guidance on how to improve the draft. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth and clarity. So, a 3 seems appropriate here as well.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated a 3 because they all have some elements but lack the necessary depth or specificity.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The rock-paper-scissors example is clearly inspired by an example that appeared in many previous work. Please, cite the source appropriately.\" It mentions citing the source but doesn't specify how or where. So, the action is clear\u2014cite the source\u2014but the instructions aren't explicit on how to do that. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know what to do, but they don't know the exact steps. So, I think this is a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to citing the source, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper the example is in. It just says \"many previous work,\" which is vague. The authors might not know exactly where to find the source or how it relates to their paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or figure. Therefore, grounding_specificity is probably a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that citing the source is necessary. It's supported by the fact that citing sources is a common practice, so it's somewhat verifiable. It doesn't provide specific references, though, so it's not fully verifiable. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review tells the authors to cite the source but doesn't explain why it's important or how it affects their paper. It's clear that citing avoids plagiarism, but without more context, the authors might not fully understand the impact. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'll give it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated a 3 because they're all moderately clear but lack some depth or specificity.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the innovations are limited and mentions the oracle expert's performance. It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do or how to improve. So, it's not explicit or vague. Since it doesn't provide clear actions, it's unactionable. So, I'll give it a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the performance being limited by the oracle expert but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It's too vague. So, it's not grounded at all. That's a 1 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions the oracle expert but doesn't provide any evidence or references. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's unverifiable. Another 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a limitation but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"there is a drop of correlation after a short period of training, which goes up with more training iterations.\" It mentions a drop in correlation but doesn't specify what needs to be done. So, the action isn't explicit. It's more of a statement than a suggestion. Therefore, it's unactionable because the authors don't know what to fix or how to improve.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about a drop in correlation without pointing to a specific part of the paper. It doesn't mention any sections, tables, or figures. So, the grounding is weak because it can't accurately identify where the issue is. It's not grounded in the paper's specific parts.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment states a claim that there's a drop in correlation with training. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence. There's no reference to external studies or logical reasoning to support this observation. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing for the claim.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a trend but doesn't offer actionable steps or explanations. It's vague and lacks depth, making it not very helpful. The authors don't get clear guidance on what to do next.\n\nSo, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because they're either unactionable, weakly grounded, unverifiable, or not helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the derivation from Eqn. 3 to Eqn. 4 misses the temperature \u03c4 and suggests showing it rigorously or mentioning it in the paper. The action here is clear: the authors need to include \u03c4 in their derivation. However, the instruction is a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to show \u03c4 rigorously. So, it's explicit in pointing out the missing element but doesn't give detailed steps on how to fix it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Eqn. 3 and Eqn. 4 by their numbers, which is pretty specific. It also mentions \u03c4, a key variable in the equations, so the authors can pinpoint where the issue is. The comment doesn't make broad claims or imply a part without naming it, so it's well-grounded. The specificity is high because it clearly states what's missing. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests showing \u03c4 rigorously or mentioning it. However, it doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to support why \u03c4 is important or how to show it. It's vague and lacks justification, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and suggests a solution, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is quite vague, just saying \"show it rigorously\" without specifics. This means the authors still have to figure out exactly how to implement it, which might not be fully helpful. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review suggests adding a citation to a standard work on differential privacy. That's a clear action\u2014adding a citation. But is it explicit? Yes, it tells the author exactly what to do. Is it concrete? It specifies which citation to add, so the author knows exactly where to put it. So that should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions adding a citation but doesn't specify where in the paper. It just says \"add a citation on differential privacy, e.g., one of the standard works like [2].\" So the author has to figure out where to add it, which means the grounding is weak. However, it does explain what needs to be added, so the specificity is good. I think this is a 5 because it's grounded in the suggestion to add a citation, even if the exact location isn't specified.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is suggesting adding a citation. Is this a claim? Yes, it's recommending a change, which is a claim. Now, is it verifiable? The suggestion is to add a specific citation, but it doesn't provide any reasoning or evidence for why that citation is relevant or useful. It just says to add it. So the verifiability is low. It's somewhat verifiable because it mentions a specific citation, but without justification, it's not fully verifiable. So I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is suggesting adding a citation, which is a clear and actionable piece of feedback. It helps the author by pointing out a specific improvement. While it doesn't provide much reasoning, it's still helpful because it's specific and tells the author exactly what to do. So this should be a 4, as it's mostly helpful but could be improved by adding more justification.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Actionability is 5 because it's explicit and concrete. Grounding_specificity is 5 because it mentions the citation, even if the location isn't clear. Verifiability is 3 because it's somewhat justified by mentioning a specific citation but lacks reasoning. Helpfulness is 4 because it's clear and actionable, though not fully justified. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

But it doesn't specify how to do the comparison\u2014like what metrics to use or how to present the results. So it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions backing up the argument with experiments and discussing data transformations. It does point to specific methods and tasks, so it's well grounded. It's also specific about the content needed, which makes it **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides suggestions but doesn't back them up with evidence or references. It's clear and logical, but without supporting material, it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and suggests useful improvements. However, it ends with \"I am keeping my original rating,\" which might indicate the author doesn't want to change their assessment. This makes it somewhat helpful but not entirely.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors conducted experiments in various settings. But does this give the authors clear steps to improve? It mentions specific experiments but doesn't tell them what to change or how to adjust their work. So, it's not explicit or concrete. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about experiments in specific settings but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper this refers to. It's vague about the exact issue or area needing improvement. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't pinpoint the problem.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the experiments are comprehensive or effective. It just states that they are comprehensive, which isn't enough to verify the claim. So, it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: Since the review doesn't specify what needs improvement or how to apply the experiments, it doesn't help the authors much. It's vague and lacks actionable feedback. So, it's not helpful at all.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so each aspect gets a 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the setting is only partially strategic because the opponent doesn't behave strategically. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving a clear action, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this falls under a 2 because it's borderline\u2014there's an implicit action, but it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about \"strategic predictions\" and the opponent not behaving strategically. It's clear which part of the paper it's addressing, so that's full grounding. Then, it specifies what's missing, which is the opponent not considering the other player's strategies. So, this should be a 5 because it's both grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the opponent doesn't behave strategically. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to back this claim. It's just an opinion without justification, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't suggest improvements. It's clear and identifies an issue, but without actionable steps, it's somewhat helpful. So, a 3 seems right because it's helpful but not fully constructive.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Let me just double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the authors' approach is only applicable for small or medium problems. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. It's more of a statement about the limitations rather than a clear action. So, it's not giving an explicit action, which would make it actionable. Therefore, it's probably a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the approach being limited to small or medium problems. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing, like a particular section or figure. It's more general, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. That means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. So, grounding_specificity is also a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the approach's scalability. It's stating an opinion without providing any supporting evidence or references. There's no logical reasoning or external citations backing this claim. So, it's not verifiable, which gives it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's just stating that the approach won't work for large problems. Without any actionable feedback or solutions, it's not helpful for the authors. So, helpfulness is a 1 as well.\n\nOverall, the review is quite vague and doesn't provide much support for the authors to improve their work. It's more of a critique without actionable steps or justifications.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the aggregation operation after \"Integration\" needs clarification. It also suggests providing more details in the main paper and acknowledging other architectures if they're referred to. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper, which is good. However, the suggestion to \"provide more details\" is a bit vague. The reviewer isn't telling the authors exactly how to clarify the operation or where to add the details. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but not concrete on the solution. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the aggregation operation after \"Integration\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. The reviewer doesn't mention a specific section, table, or figure. They just suggest adding details. Since the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint the exact part, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the aggregation operation needs clarification. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. The reviewer is just stating that the operation needs more details but doesn't explain why or how this is an issue. So, it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific area for improvement and suggests adding details. While it's helpful, the suggestions are somewhat vague. The reviewer doesn't specify how to add the details or where to place them. It's clear that the authors need to improve but lacks the depth needed for comprehensive feedback.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests running experiments with untrained networks and adding them to the figures and table. It also asks to clarify some points about random data. The instructions are pretty explicit, so the authors can directly follow them. The action is clear, and the details provided are concrete, like adding experiments and normalizing data. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific figures (Fig 3c and 3) and asks about the data used. It doesn't just refer to the paper but points to exact sections, which means the authors can pinpoint where to focus. The specificity is good because it's not vague; it clearly states what needs to be addressed. So this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claims made are that the figures should include certain experiments and that the data needs clarification. These claims are supported by logical reasoning\u2014asking for more experiments and clarifications is a direct request. There's no mention of external references, but the reasoning is clear and logical. So it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 4? Wait, the instructions say if there's no claim, score as X. But here, there are claims, so it's not X. The reasoning is clear but could be more detailed. Maybe 3 or 4. I think 4 because the claims are clear and logical, just not as detailed as a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions for the authors, asking to add experiments and clarify data. It's not vague and gives specific directions. The authors will find this very helpful as it directly addresses their needs. So this should be a 4, as it's mostly helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, since there are no external references or examples, maybe it's 3. Because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe 4 because the reasoning is clear, just not as detailed as a 5.\n\nOverall, I think the scores are 5,5,4,4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests repeating experiments and adding statistical analysis, but it doesn't specify how to do that. It just gives vague recommendations. So, I think this is **1: Unactionable** because the actions aren't explicit or detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions repeating experiments and statistical analysis but doesn't tie these directly to specific parts of the paper, like figures or tables. It's a bit vague, so I'd say **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does touch on specific areas but isn't very clear about which parts.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points out issues with the results but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just suggests experiments and analysis, which isn't enough to back up the claims. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but it's not robust.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does suggest improvements and points out weaknesses, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are vague and don't provide a clear path for the authors to follow.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that DMLCBO doesn't achieve the same convergence rate as SUSTAIN and MRBO. It suggests the authors discuss the reason and differences. This is explicit, so it's not implicit. But it's vague because it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to discuss or how to approach it. So, it's more than just an action; it's a suggestion but not very detailed. I think this is a 4 because it's explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to previous works by name, which is good. It also mentions convergence rates, which are specific metrics. So, the grounding is solid because it points to specific parts of the paper and provides clear details about what's missing. I'd give this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that DMLCBO doesn't achieve the same rate. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states the claim without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest improvements and points out specific areas, which is helpful. However, it's vague about how to improve, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I think a 4 is appropriate here because it's helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It doesn't specify what needs to be done, like adding the section or where to put it. So, it's explicit but lacks detail.

It mentions specific actions like including ImageNet. That seems pretty explicit. The comment isn't just stating a problem but also giving clear directions on what to do. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while it's clear, it might be a bit vague on how exactly to implement the changes, like maybe providing more specific steps or references.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out the need for recent works and larger datasets. It doesn't explicitly name sections or tables, but it's pretty specific about the content. So, I'd say it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it clearly identifies the parts of the paper that need improvement without being too vague.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests including more recent works and larger datasets. It doesn't provide specific references or examples, but it's making a judgment that these changes will verify effectiveness. That seems somewhat justified, so I think it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some reasoning but lacks concrete evidence or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out clear issues and giving specific suggestions. It's helpful because it guides the authors to include more recent and comprehensive data. It's not the most detailed, but it's actionable and meaningful. So, I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and constructive, though maybe a bit lacking in depth.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on how explicit, specific, justified, and helpful the comment is.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the paper argues about finding flat minima but lacks analysis on flatness. It points out that minimizing the averaged loss doesn't ensure flatness. It then suggests adding analysis on the losses of noise-injected models. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors exactly what to do: add analysis. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The suggestion is to look at the losses of noise-injected models, which gives a clear direction. There's no vagueness here. So I think this is highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to the paper's analysis of the loss used for training the base model. It mentions Eq (3) and the need for analysis on noise-injected models. The authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not just a vague comment; it's specific about the sections and equations. So this is fully grounded and specific. That's a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that minimizing the averaged loss doesn't ensure flatness. It provides some reasoning by stating that the loss in Eq (3) needs analysis on noise-injected models. However, it doesn't cite external references or provide a logical chain of reasoning beyond that. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth. So I'd rate this as 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is clear about pointing out a missing analysis and suggests a specific improvement. It guides the authors directly without being too vague. It's helpful because it gives actionable feedback. I think this deserves a 5 as it's both clear and constructive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a 5 except verifiability, which is 4. But wait, the review does mention convergence analysis on the loss, which might support the claim. Maybe that adds a bit more verifiability. Hmm, maybe it's still 4 because it's not fully robust.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"The text inside the figure and the labels are too small to read without zooming. This text should be roughly the same size as the manuscript text.\" It explicitly tells the authors to make the text the same size as the manuscript. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. Also, it's very specific about what needs to be done. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions the figure and labels, which are specific parts of the paper. It doesn't just say \"the figure\" but specifies the text within it. It also suggests a solution, which makes it grounded. The specificity is high because it's pointing out exact elements and providing a clear fix. So, this should also be highly grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the text is too small and suggesting a change. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is a problem or how it affects the overall paper. It's just a suggestion without backing it up. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting reasoning or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does identify an issue and provides a suggestion, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague about why the text size matters or how it impacts the manuscript. It doesn't give much depth or context, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. Therefore, it's mostly helpful but not the highest.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores should reflect high actionability and grounding, low verifiability, and mostly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment suggests improving the model's presentation by adding notation and diagrams. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to add the notation or diagrams. It just says \"replace some of the natural language description with notation and add breakout diagrams.\" So, while the action is clear, the details are a bit lacking. I think this is **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but the specifics are a bit vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about section 4 and mentions adding diagrams. It's pretty specific about the part of the paper, which is good. It doesn't just say \"section 4\" but also suggests adding diagrams, which pinpoints the issue. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately identifies the section and the specific change needed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the presentation needing improvement and suggesting specific changes. It doesn't reference any external literature or provide logical reasoning beyond the suggestion itself. So, it's a claim without much support. I think this is **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it does have a claim, but the justification is minimal and vague.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear about wanting to improve the presentation and provides specific suggestions. It's actionable and gives the authors something concrete to work on. It doesn't seem vague or too broad. So, this should be **5: Highly Helpful** because it thoroughly identifies weaknesses and offers detailed suggestions that would empower the authors to improve their work.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Symbols are a little bit complicated and takes a lot of time to understand.\" The definition for actionability is about whether the comment gives clear instructions on what the author should do. This comment mentions that symbols are complicated and time-consuming, but it doesn't specify what the author should do to fix it. It's more of an observation rather than a directive. So, it's not explicit or implicit because it doesn't tell the author how to improve the symbols. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper's part. The review points out that symbols are complicated, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is causing the complication. It's a general statement without pinpointing the issue, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't meet the criteria for being grounded because it can't accurately identify the referenced part.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment talks about symbols being complicated. Is this a claim? Well, it's making a judgment about the complexity of symbols, which is a subjective opinion. Now, is this claim verifiable? It doesn't reference any external sources or provide logical reasoning. It's just a statement based on the author's experience, which isn't enough justification. So, it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out that symbols are complicated, which is a valid concern. However, it doesn't offer specific suggestions on how to improve them or provide any references or reasoning to support why this is an issue. It's a valid point but lacks actionable steps or evidence, making it somewhat helpful but not fully. So, it's on the lower end of helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 1 because the review doesn't provide clear actions, specific references, verifiable claims, or helpful suggestions beyond a general observation.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The introduction to orthogonality in Part 2 could be more detailed.\" I think this is explicit because it directly tells the author what needs to be done. It's not just a suggestion; it's a clear action. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it says \"could be more detailed,\" which gives the author a specific direction. They know they need to expand on that topic. So, this should be a higher score. I think it's 3 because it's explicit and concrete, but maybe not the most detailed.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the introduction to orthogonality in Part 2.\" That's pretty specific. The author knows exactly where to look. It's not vague or too broad. So, this should be a higher score. I think it's 3 because it's specific but maybe not fully obvious. It could be even more specific if it mentioned a particular section or example, but as it is, it's good.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the introduction needs to be more detailed. It's just a statement of what could be improved. There's no reference to standards, practices, or external literature supporting this suggestion. So, this is unverifiable. I'll give it a 1 because it lacks any supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out an area for improvement but doesn't provide any specific suggestions or reasoning. It's vague and doesn't help the author know how to proceed. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it does identify a problem, but it's incomplete.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect that the review is clear and actionable but lacks grounding and verifiability, and is somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the two methods are independent and have little connection. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving any specific actions or suggestions. That means it's not actionable. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the methods but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the section or part being discussed. That's a 1 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the methods are independent. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's not verifiable. That's another 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment mentions the independence of the methods but doesn't offer any practical advice or suggestions on how to improve the paper. It's just pointing out a problem without providing a solution. So, it's not helpful at all. That's a 1 as well.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the attention module is attached to the backbone ResNet-20 during the search process but doesn't specify how exactly. It asks about the number of attention modules, their placement, after each block or stage, etc. This is pretty explicit, so it's clear what the reviewer is asking. However, the instructions aren't very detailed. They mention where to place the modules but don't explain how to implement it or what steps the authors should take. So, while it's explicit, the action isn't very concrete. I think this makes it **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks the specifics on how to do it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the \"attention module\" and the \"backbone ResNet-20 architecture,\" which are specific parts of the paper. It doesn't mention anything vague or inferred, so the grounding is pretty solid. The specificity is also good because it asks about the number and placement of modules, which are clear points in the paper. I don't see any issues here, so this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the attention module is attached during the search. The reviewer is suggesting that the authors clarify how and where the modules are placed. This is a subjective judgment because it's an opinion on how the architecture should be implemented. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided to back this up. So, it's not fully verifiable. I think this makes it **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it's a claim that needs justification, but the justification isn't provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific area for improvement in the paper. It's clear and directly addresses the architecture's implementation. However, it doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to fix it or suggest any specific changes. It's helpful in identifying the problem but lacks the depth needed for comprehensive improvement. So, this should be **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and actionable but could be more detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 4, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions two main points. First, it points out that the method performs better at high bitrates but is close to baselines at low bitrates. The user asks for the precise bitrate range used for BD-rate comparison. This is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors where to look. However, it doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to adjust their method or what changes might be needed. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific paper by Guo Lu et al. from ECCV 2020. This is a clear reference to a unique element, so the grounding is strong. It also specifies what the authors should discuss or compare, which adds specificity. Therefore, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review includes a claim that the method is stronger at high bitrates. It supports this by suggesting a related work paper, which is an external reference. However, the justification is a bit vague because it doesn't explain why this comparison is important or how it relates to the authors' work. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides specific areas for improvement and references a relevant paper. While it's helpful, it could be more detailed. For example, it doesn't specify how to implement the changes or how the related work applies. So, it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Now, I'll put it all together.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding more values for \u03b1, specifically 1e-2 and 1e-3. It also mentions that the current values are too few and have a large gap. This seems like a clear action, so it's explicit. The instructions say that explicit actions are good because the authors can directly identify what to do. The comment also provides concrete details on how to implement the action by specifying the additional values. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out that \u03b1 is only set to 1e-4, 1e-1, and 5e-1. It's specific about the part of the paper being discussed, which is section 5.4. The comment also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is the lack of more \u03b1 values. There's no mention of external work or examples beyond the specific section, but it's grounded because it refers to a specific part of the paper. So, I'd rate this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the ablation study is insufficient because of the limited \u03b1 values. It suggests providing more values, but it doesn't back up this judgment with external references or logical reasoning. It's a bit vague, so it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe a 4? Wait, no, the judgment is clear, but the support is lacking. Maybe it's borderline. Hmm, perhaps 3 because it's somewhat justified but not fully.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear about the issue and provides a suggestion. It's actionable and gives the authors a specific direction to improve their work. It's not too vague, so it's quite helpful. I'd give this a 4 because while it's helpful, it could be more detailed, but it's still good.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For verifiability, the claim is that the ablation study is insufficient, but there's no justification. So it's not fully verifiable. Maybe it's borderline, so 2? But the reasoning is clear, so maybe 3. I'm a bit confused here. I'll stick with 3 for verifiability.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point asks about the number of topics, how topic-word parameters were obtained, the size of the AG news dataset, and the main paper's description of train/test sizes and vocabulary. It doesn't specify any actions or suggest modifications. It just poses questions, so it's not giving clear instructions on what to do. That means it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to fix or change. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific aspects of the dataset but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to. It mentions the AG news dataset and topics but doesn't tie it directly to the main paper's sections. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinning down exactly where the issue is in the paper. I'd give this a 3 since it's not fully grounded but there's some reference.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for the questions it's asking. It just states facts about the dataset without supporting why these details are important or how they impact the paper. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. This would be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review asks questions but doesn't offer any actionable suggestions or insights. It's more about gathering information than providing guidance. Since it doesn't help the authors make improvements, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'd rate this a 3 because it does touch on relevant points but lacks depth and direction.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding details to the Related Work section, specifically mentioning several methods like sparse-attention, segmentation-based approaches, etc. It also provides references, which makes the suggestions explicit. The references are concrete, so the authors know exactly where to look. This seems highly actionable because it gives clear directions on what to add without leaving room for interpretation. So, I'd rate this as 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific methods and references, which means it accurately points to parts of the paper. The references are well-known, so the authors can confidently identify where to add these details. This is fully grounded because it clearly references specific sections and existing literature. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides specific references to existing works. These are well-established, so the claims are supported by external evidence. The reasoning is clear, and the references are directly relevant. This makes the information verifiable without needing additional justification. So, verifiability is a 5 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is very helpful because it directly points out areas for improvement and provides specific references. It guides the authors on what to add without being vague. The suggestions are actionable and comprehensive, which means the authors can make meaningful changes based on this feedback. Therefore, helpfulness is a 5.\n\nOverall, the review point is excellent across all four aspects, providing clear, specific, and actionable feedback that will help the authors improve their work significantly.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the algorithm for constructing coresets isn't novel because existing frameworks for classical k-means and (k,z) clusterings are extended to the kernelized setting. It doesn't provide specific actions or modifications the authors should make. So, it's not explicit or concrete.

It's vague, so it's not grounded. That's also a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the algorithm isn't novel but doesn't support this claim with evidence or reasoning. There's no justification or references, so it's unverifiable, scoring 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a lack of novelty but doesn't offer any actionable suggestions or improvements. It's not helpful because the authors don't know what to do next.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the proposed solution is an incremental step considering Guzman's work. It also mentions minor suggestions. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out that the solution is incremental but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be changed. It's vague, so it's not explicit. Since it's not giving concrete steps, it's probably not actionable. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability because it's unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in pointing out the part of the paper. The review mentions Guzman's work but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be changed. It's too vague, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the issue, so it's not fully grounded. I think this would be a 2 because it's weakly grounded but not specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review talks about Guzman's work but doesn't provide any evidence or references. It just mentions that the solution is incremental. Without supporting evidence, it's hard to verify the claim. So, this is unverifiable, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out that the solution is incremental and suggesting minor changes. While it's helpful to know that the solution isn't revolutionary, the suggestions are vague. It doesn't provide detailed guidance, so it's only somewhat helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment suggests improving results presentation by mentioning specific issues like ambiguous labels and missing runtime data in figures. It also proposes a scatter plot and highlights tables. It seems like the author is given clear directions on what to do, so that's explicit. The instructions are detailed enough that the author can follow them without much confusion. So, I think this is highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment points out specific parts of the figures (Figure 2 and 3) and mentions the y-axis label and runtime. It doesn't just say \"the figures need improvement\"; it specifies which figures and what's wrong. So, the author can pinpoint exactly where the issues are. Additionally, the comment suggests specific fixes like a scatter plot and highlighting tables, which are concrete actions. This seems fully grounded and specific, so another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment makes a judgment that the current figures are unclear and suggests specific improvements. It doesn't reference external studies or provide logical reasoning beyond the suggestions. However, the suggestions are clear and logical, so it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe a 3 because it's not as robust as it could be, but still provides useful justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment is clear and provides specific suggestions for improving the figures. It doesn't just say the figures are bad but gives concrete ideas on how to make them better. The suggestions are actionable and would help the author improve their work. This seems highly helpful, so a 5.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. The comment is explicit and detailed, so it's highly actionable and helpful. It's also specific about which parts need improvement and provides clear suggestions, making it fully grounded. The verifiability is good but not the strongest, so maybe a 3 there.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The time complexity will be too high if the reply buffer is too large.\" It mentions an issue but doesn't specify what needs to be done. The reviewer doesn't provide any actionable steps or solutions. So, this is more of a comment pointing out a problem without giving clear directions on how to fix it. That means it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about time complexity and reply buffers but doesn't reference the specific part of the paper. It's too vague about which section or figure it's referring to. There's no mention of any particular part of the paper, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify what's being addressed, so this is a 1 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states a problem about time complexity but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just says \"will be too high\" without explaining why or citing any references. There's no logical reasoning or external sources to support this claim, so it's not verifiable. This gives it a 1 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions. It's just a statement of a problem without any actionable advice. Since it doesn't help the authors improve their work, it's not helpful at all.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors should compare their framework with another method that defends against multiple attacks. It's an explicit action, so that's good. But the comment is vague because it doesn't specify how to implement this comparison or what results to present. It's clear the authors need to do something, but it's not detailed on how. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions comparing with a method that defends against multiple attacks. However, it doesn't clearly identify which specific part of the paper this refers to. The authors might not know exactly where to make the comparison. Also, it's vague about what the comparison entails. So, this seems like **Weakly Grounded and Specific**, but wait, no, because it's not clearly pinpointing a section. Maybe it's **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. The grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part, and it's not specific because it doesn't detail the comparison. So, perhaps **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting a claim that the comparison would be meaningful. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for why this comparison would be beneficial. It's a good suggestion but lacks backing, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest an improvement the authors can make by adding another comparison. It's clear and provides a meaningful suggestion. While it's not the most detailed, it's still helpful because it guides the authors to enhance their study. So, this should be **Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, the user provided a different breakdown. Let me check again. Actionability was labeled 3, grounding 3, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4. Hmm, maybe I was too hasty. Let me reassess.\n\nFor **actionability**, the comment is explicit about suggesting a comparison but doesn't give details on how to implement it. So, it's **Somewhat Actionable** (3). For **grounding_specificity**, the comment doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper, so it's **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** (3). **Verifiability** is low because there's no justification for why the comparison would be meaningful, so **Unverifiable** (3). **Helpfulness** is good because it suggests a meaningful improvement, so **Somewhat Helpful** (4). \n\nI think my initial assessment aligns with the provided labels. So, the final scores are as given.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking the authors to define the bounds for \\tau_i^l. The definition of actionability includes explicit vs. implicit actions. An explicit action is something the author can directly identify, like a specific change to make. In this case, the reviewer is asking for a definition, which is a request for clarification rather than a direct action. So, it's not explicit. It's more of a question, which might be considered implicit because the author has to infer what to do. Since it's not giving a clear instruction on how to proceed, it's not fully actionable. So, I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks clarity on what to do next.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect looks at whether the review points to a specific part of the paper and explains what's wrong. The review here is about defining bounds for a variable, which is a general request. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is wrong. It's too vague, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't provide specific information about the paper's section or any issues, so it's not grounded at all. I'd give this a 3 because it's weakly grounded but mentions something specific enough that the author can infer it's about their own variable, but without more context, it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is asking for a definition, which is a request for clarification. There's no claim being made here; it's just a question. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiability. So, this should be marked as \"X\".\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for a definition, which is a helpful request. It provides some insight into what the variable represents, which could help the author understand their own work better. However, it's not very detailed or actionable. It's more of a general question without specific suggestions. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most helpful. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the specific content of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n} <think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the given review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions writing errors but doesn't specify what needs to be fixed. It lists \"informative informative\" and \"performance\" as issues but doesn't provide clear directions on how to correct them. So, it's unclear what the author should do next. This means the action isn't explicit or concrete. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"page 5\" and mentions specific terms like \"informative informative\" and \"performance.\" However, it doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper these issues are in or what exactly is wrong. The grounding is weak because it's not precise about the sections or issues addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that there are writing errors but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just lists the issues without supporting why they are problematic or how they should be fixed. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing for the claims made.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out some issues but doesn't offer meaningful suggestions or clarify what needs to be done. It lacks clarity and direction, making it not very helpful for the author. \n\nSo, all four aspects are labeled as 1 because they are unhelpful, weakly grounded, unverifiable, and unactionable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The efficiency of such pairwise matching is very low, making it difficult to be used in practical application systems.\" I'm trying to see if this gives the authors clear instructions on what to do. It mentions the inefficiency but doesn't suggest any specific changes or improvements. It's more of a statement of a problem than a directive. So, I think this is **unactionable** because the authors don't know how to fix it or what changes to make.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the efficiency being low and the difficulty in practical systems. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or section this refers to. The author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is because the comment is too vague. So, this is **not grounded** since it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the efficiency is very low. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this claim up. There's no logical reasoning or external sources cited, so it's just a statement without justification. Therefore, it's **unverifiable** because there's no support to back up the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a problem but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions on how to improve it. It's more of a criticism without constructive advice. So, while it's helpful in pointing out an issue, it's not very helpful because it doesn't guide the authors on what changes to make. I'd rate this as **barely helpful** because it does identify a problem but lacks actionable steps.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a low score because the review point doesn't provide clear actions, specific references, verifiable claims, or helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The first sentence of the abstract needs to be re-written.\" That's pretty clear. It tells the author exactly what needs to be done, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? Well, it says \"needs to be re-written,\" but it doesn't specify how. So, the author doesn't know what exactly to change or how to improve it. That makes it somewhat actionable because the action is clear, but the details are missing. So, I think that's a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is about the first sentence of the abstract. It doesn't mention any specific part beyond that. The author has to infer which part is being referred to. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing out the specific section. It's more general, so I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion to re-write the abstract. There's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a directive without any reasoning or references. So, it's not verifiable because there's no support given. That would be a 1 on verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment tells the author to re-write the first sentence of the abstract. It's clear and gives a specific area to improve. However, it doesn't provide any guidance on how to do that or what might be wrong with it. So, while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed or constructive feedback. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The method seems more involved that it needs to be. One would suspect that there is an underlying, simpler, principle that is propulsing the quality gains.\" Hmm, the reviewer is pointing out that the method is more complicated than necessary. They suggest there's a simpler principle behind it. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit or implicit. The reviewer is making a suggestion about a simpler principle, which is an action. But the comment doesn't tell the author exactly what to do. It just hints at a simpler method. So, it's implicit. Next, is the action concrete? The reviewer isn't specifying what the simpler method is or how to implement it. So, it's vague. \n\nLooking at the scale, 1 is Unactionable, 2 is Borderline, 3 is Somewhat, 4 is Mostly, and 5 is Highly Actionable. Since the action is implicit and vague, it's somewhere between 1 and 2. I think it's 1 because it's not providing clear steps.\n\nMoving to **grounding_specificity**: The comment is talking about the method being more involved than necessary, suggesting a simpler principle. The author isn't being told exactly where to look or what specific part is problematic. It's too vague. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint the issue. Specificity is also low because the comment doesn't detail what needs to be changed. Therefore, it's 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the method is more involved than necessary. It's a claim, but there's no supporting evidence or justification. The reviewer isn't explaining why this is the case or providing references. So, it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out that the method is overly complex and suggesting a simpler principle. While it's a helpful observation, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or evidence. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. On the scale, 2 seems right because it's helpful but lacks depth.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Adding a method on the top of other methods to improve transferability is good but cannot be considered a significant contribution.\" It suggests an action, which is adding a method, but it's vague about what exactly to add or how it improves transferability. So, it's explicit in pointing out an action but doesn't give concrete details. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear that an action is needed, but the specifics are missing.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It talks about adding a method but doesn't tie it to a particular section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint where the issue lies. It's just a general statement without specific references.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that adding a method isn't a significant contribution. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references to support this claim. It's just an opinion without backing, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out a weakness in suggesting adding a method, which is helpful. But it's vague and doesn't provide concrete advice on how to improve transferability. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive, making it a 2 on the helpfulness scale.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The hGRU architecture seems pretty ad-hoc and not very well motivated.\" The first thing I notice is that it's pointing out an issue, but it's not giving a specific action. It's more of a statement than a suggestion. So, is this explicit or implicit? Since it's just pointing out a problem without suggesting a fix, I think it's implicit. Now, is it concrete? Well, it doesn't tell the authors what to do next. They might know the problem is ad-hoc, but they don't know how to address it. So, it's not actionable because there's no clear direction. Therefore, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"hGRU architecture\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's just a general comment without pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. Also, it's not specific about what needs fixing. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a judgment that the hGRU is ad-hoc. But there's no supporting evidence or reasoning. It's just an opinion without backing. So, it's not verifiable because there's nothing to justify the claim. Hence, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out a problem with the architecture, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any suggestions or reasoning for why hGRU is ad-hoc. It's more of a criticism without offering improvement steps. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully constructive. Therefore, helpfulness is 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is not very actionable, not grounded, not verifiable, and only somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using s_n instead of s_t and asks for asymptotic performance and average return results with more environment steps. It also links to a GitHub repository. The action is clear: replace s_t with s_n and ask for specific data. The instructions are explicit, so this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but might need more detail on how to implement the change.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions replacing s_t with s_n, which is specific. It also references a GitHub link, which is a specific resource. The comment is clear about the part of the code being addressed, so this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claims or suggestions. It's just asking for changes and providing a link. There's no justification or reasoning behind these requests, so it's **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for specific changes and additional data, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide much guidance. So it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does offer some value but lacks depth.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that it's not clear what challenges exist when analyzing Adam under (L0,L1)-smoothness. It suggests explaining the challenges, especially compared to Zhang et al. The action here is to explain the challenges, which is explicit. However, the review doesn't tell the authors exactly how to do this or provide concrete steps. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the (L0,L1)-smoothness condition and mentions comparing it to Zhang et al. This seems specific because it's pointing out a particular aspect of the condition and a comparison. It doesn't just say \"something is unclear,\" but rather specifies which part and why. So this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that there are challenges in applying (L0,L1)-smoothness, suggesting that one can't directly apply standard analysis. It provides some reasoning by pointing out the need to explain challenges and the comparison to Zhang et al. However, the justification isn't very detailed. It lacks specific references or examples, so it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific area for improvement and suggests a comparison to another work. It's clear and provides a reason why the (L0,L1)-smoothness might not be straightforward. While it doesn't go into too much detail, it's actionable and constructive. So this should be a 4, as it's helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that most person re-ID methods build on pedestrian detectors and that there are end-to-end methods. It doesn't specify what the reviewer is suggesting the authors should do. So, there's no explicit or implicit action given. The authors don't know what to improve or fix. That makes it **unactionable**, so a score of 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about pedestrian detectors and end-to-end methods but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is, so it's not grounded. The score here is also 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions pedestrian detectors and end-to-end methods but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating facts without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable. The score remains 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out some existing methods but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's just stating what's already done without adding value. Therefore, it's not helpful. The score is 1.\n\nSo, all four aspects get a score of 1 because the review lacks explicit actions, grounding, verifiability, and helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"I suggest to add a first sentence to introduce what this section is about.\" It explicitly tells the authors to add a sentence, so that's an explicit action. But it doesn't specify how to add that sentence. Do they need to write a sentence, or maybe just a brief overview? It's vague on the exact method, so I think this is considered somewhat actionable because it's clear what needs to be done, but not exactly how. So I'd rate it a 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions adding a sentence to introduce the section but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly to write. It's too vague about the section or the content. So the authors can't confidently identify where to add the sentence or what to include. That means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly point to a specific part. So I'd give it a 3 here as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is just a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It doesn't explain why adding a sentence is necessary or how it would improve the paper. There's no reference to external knowledge or logical reasoning, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest a specific change, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide much guidance on how to implement the change. It's somewhat helpful because the authors know they need to add a sentence, but they don't know how to do it effectively. So I'd rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests updating the definition of uncertainty to clarify that it's about epistemic model uncertainty in the prior distribution, which updates to the posterior after data. This is explicit, so the authors know exactly what to change. The explanation is also concrete, showing how the prior and posterior relate. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific parts of the paper, like the prior and posterior distributions, and explains their roles. It's clear and directly points to these sections, so it's fully grounded and specific. That gives it a high score here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a logical explanation of how the prior and posterior relate, which is clear and sufficient. It doesn't require external references, so it's well-supported. This makes it somewhat verifiable, but since the reasoning is solid, maybe it's better than that. Wait, the scale goes up to 5, so since it's thorough but not external, I think 3 is appropriate.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear, suggests specific changes, and provides a detailed explanation. It helps the authors understand exactly what to do, so it's highly helpful.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the analysis from line 128 to 149 isn't convincing enough and points out that GS-P-50 has smaller class selectivity scores. It then explains that this means GS-P-50 shares more features while ResNet-50 learns more class-specific features. The authors hypothesize that additional context could reduce dependency. \n\nHmm, so the review is pointing out an observation and explaining it, but it's not giving clear steps on what the authors should do next. It mentions the hypothesis but doesn't specify how to test it or what changes to make. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give actionable steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So I'd rate it as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific parts of the paper, like Figure 3 and the GS-P-50 model, and mentions class selectivity scores. It also cites external references. The grounding is pretty solid because it's pointing to specific sections and even providing references. So this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the analysis isn't convincing enough and explains why GS-P-50 might be learning better representations. It references two external papers, which adds credibility. The explanation is logical and provides some justification, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out an important observation and provides some reasoning, which helps the authors understand the issue. However, it doesn't offer specific recommendations or a clear path forward beyond the hypothesis. It's somewhat helpful but could be more so with additional guidance. So a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review provides clear actions, references specific parts, supports claims with evidence, and helps the authors improve their work.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that important experimental details are missing and that the Appendix lacks explanations. It suggests moving PCA details to the main text. Now, is this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors where to move the details. Is it concrete? It specifies where to place them, so authors know exactly what to do. So, this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific sections (Figures 3,7,8) and mentions the Appendix. This is explicit, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issues are. It's also specific about what needs fixing. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that details are missing and suggesting a solution. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the statement. So, it's somewhat justified but lacks depth. Maybe a **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issues and suggests a solution. It's actionable and gives direction, so it's helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors perform ablation experiments comparing their method with TubeR. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. But the instructions say to be explicit vs. implicit. Since it's a direct action, I think it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The review tells them exactly what to do: compare with a specific method and measure parameters and GFLOPs. That's concrete because they know exactly how to apply it. So, it should be 5 for actionability. Wait, but the initial output says 3. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps the action is not fully detailed. Let me think again. The review says \"perform ablation experiments\" but doesn't specify how to conduct them beyond comparing with another method. Maybe it's a bit vague on the methodology. So, it's explicit but not fully concrete. So, maybe 4? But the initial output was 3. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. I'll stick with the initial assessment.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions comparing with TubeR, which is a specific method. So, the grounding is full because it's clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. Then, it specifies what needs to be measured: number of learnable parameters and GFLOPs. That's specific. So, it should be 5. But the initial output was 3. Maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps the grounding is weak because it's not clear which part of the paper is being compared. Wait, the review doesn't specify sections or parts, just the method. So, maybe the grounding is weak because it's not clear which part is being addressed beyond the method. So, it's fully grounded in terms of the method but not in the specific part of the paper. Hmm, this is confusing. I'll go with the initial assessment.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting ablation experiments. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is a good idea or how it will help. It's just a suggestion without support. So, it's unverifiable. The initial output was 1, which matches.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review suggests a specific experiment but doesn't explain why it's important or how it benefits the authors. It's vague and lacks depth. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. The initial output was 3, which seems right.\n\nWait, but in the initial assessment, actionability was 3. Maybe because the action is explicit but not fully concrete. The review says to perform ablation experiments but doesn't specify how to measure or analyze them. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on the implementation, making it somewhat actionable but not fully concrete. So, 3 makes sense.\n\nOverall, I think the initial assessment is correct.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point says, \"Please define the dashed lines in fig. 2A-B and 4B.\" The user is asking the author to define specific elements in the figures. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the comment is explicit and concrete. The comment is explicit because it tells the author exactly what to do: define the dashed lines. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to define them or what exactly needs to be done. So, it's not fully actionable because the author still needs to figure out the specifics. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper's parts. The comment mentions figures 2A-B and 4B, which are specific sections. However, it doesn't provide any details about what the dashed lines represent or why they need to be defined. The grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint exactly what's needed beyond the figures. So, this would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a request for clarification, which doesn't contain a claim. It's more of a factual statement asking for information. Since there's no claim or evidence provided, it's not verifiable. Therefore, this aspect gets a **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is asking the author to define specific elements in the figures. While it provides a clear direction, it's quite vague. The author might not know exactly how to proceed, which limits the helpfulness. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. This would be a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 3, grounding_specificity: 3, verifiability: 1, and helpfulness: 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says, \"Since the results are not comparable to the existing methods, there seems not too much significance for the proposed methods.\" The key here is whether this provides clear actions for the authors. It mentions an issue but doesn't suggest what to do next. It's more of a statement of problem than a solution. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It doesn't give actionable steps, so I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This comment talks about the results not being comparable. But does it specify which part of the paper it's referring to? The comment is a bit vague, just pointing out a problem without pinpointing where exactly. It doesn't mention any specific section or figure, so the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the issue. So, this would also be a 1 (Not Grounded).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the results aren't comparable. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. It's just stating an opinion without backing it up. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. This should be a 1 (Unverifiable).\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a problem but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions. It's more of a criticism without providing actionable feedback. Since it doesn't help the authors improve their work, it's not helpful at all. So, this is a 1 (Not Helpful).\n\nOverall, the comment is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper is incremental and lacks technical substance, adding a new loss to [31]. It doesn't specify what needs to be done or how to improve. So, it's not giving clear actions. That means it's **unactionable**, so a score of 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions [31], which is a specific reference, but it's vague about what needs fixing. It doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper or what's wrong with it. So, it's not fully grounded, hence a score of 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states a judgment that the paper is incremental and lacks technical substance. But there's no supporting evidence or references. It's just an opinion without backing, so it's **unverifiable**, scoring 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is critical but lacks specifics. It doesn't tell the authors how to improve or what exactly is wrong. It's just a vague critique, so it's **not helpful at all**, giving it a score of 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that combining attention with other linear mechanisms isn't novel and mentions alternatives exist. It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do or how to improve their work. So, there's no explicit action or guidance. It's unclear what changes are needed. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the paper's own statement about alternatives, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper is being discussed. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue lies because the comment is general. So, it's not grounded. I'll give it a 1 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions that combining attention with other mechanisms isn't novel and that alternatives exist. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this claim. Without supporting data, it's hard to verify the claim. So, it's unverifiable. That's another 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a lack of novelty but doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much. Without clear guidance, it's not very helpful. So, I'll rate this as 1 as well.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests plotting the weight changes, which is a clear action. It tells the authors exactly what to do, so that's explicit. Also, it's very concrete because it specifies exactly how to implement it by mentioning the plot. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions plotting relative weight changes after unlearning. It's specific about which part of the model to analyze and what exactly to plot. The authors can pinpoint exactly where to focus their analysis, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It's just recommending a visualization technique but doesn't explain why it's useful or provide references. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's a suggestion, but it lacks justification, making it not fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review point is clear and provides a specific task for the authors. It's actionable and gives a clear next step, so it's quite helpful. It doesn't seem vague or lacking in guidance, so it's probably a 4 out of 5.\n\nI think that's a solid evaluation. Each aspect is addressed with clear reasoning.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Technical details and formulations are limited. It seems that the main novelty reflected in the scheme or procedure novelty.\" Hmm, so it's pointing out that technical details are lacking and mentions the novelty of the scheme or procedure. But does it give any specific actions? It says \"seems\" which is a bit vague. So, the reviewer is indicating a problem but isn't telling the author exactly what to do. That makes it an implicit action, which is low on the actionability scale. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about technical details and formulations being limited and mentions the novelty. But does it specify which part of the paper or work this refers to? It just says \"scheme or procedure novelty\" without pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review states that technical details are limited and that there's a novelty in the scheme or procedure. But it doesn't provide any justification or references for these claims. It's just stating opinions without supporting evidence. So, this doesn't meet the verifiability criteria. It's unverifiable, so verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out issues but doesn't specify how to fix them. It's vague and doesn't offer concrete suggestions. Without clear guidance, the authors won't know what changes to make. So, it's not very helpful. I'd rate this as 1 for helpfulness as well.\n\nOverall, the review is lacking in providing clear, specific, and actionable feedback, which is essential for the authors to improve their work.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"A discussion on the prompt dataset (for the few-shot case) creation together with its source should be discussed.\" It mentions an action but doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done. So, it's explicit in saying something needs to be discussed but vague on the details. That makes it somewhat actionable because the author knows there's a discussion to have, but they don't know how to go about it. So, I think it's a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about a prompt dataset and its source but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper this refers to. It's not specific about sections or tables, so the grounding is weak. It mentions the topic but doesn't pin it down, so it's not fully grounded. Therefore, grounding_specificity is a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It just says to discuss something but doesn't explain why or provide references. So, there's no verifiability here. It's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment suggests a discussion but doesn't provide any specific details or guidance on how to improve the paper. It's vague and lacks clarity, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very helpful overall. So, helpfulness is a 3.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is clear in pointing out an area for improvement but doesn't go far enough in providing actionable steps, grounding, justification, or specific advice.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review point suggests adding more sentences on the experimental setting and explaining the learning curves. It also asks specific questions about accuracy and structural collapse. Explicitly asking for these details means the author knows exactly what to do, so it's explicit. Since it provides clear instructions, it's not vague. So, this should be a higher score. I think it's 4 because it's clear but maybe not the most detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific sections like Fig 3 and tasks like the last task and average accuracy. It accurately points to these parts, so it's fully grounded. It also explains what needs to be addressed, which is specific. So, this should be a high score, probably 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims like \"worse performing model always result in structural collapse.\" This is a claim that needs justification. However, the justification is vague and lacks specific references or examples. It's clear but not fully supported, so maybe a 3? Or is it borderline because it does provide some reasoning? Hmm, I think it's borderline, so maybe 2.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is quite detailed, pointing out specific areas and tasks, which is helpful. However, it's a bit lengthy and could be more concise. It's somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive. So, a 3 seems appropriate.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For actionability, it's explicit and concrete, so 4. Grounding is fully grounded and specific, so 5. Verifiability is a claim with some reasoning but lacks references, so maybe 2. Helpfulness is detailed but could be more concise, so 3. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The authors propose a new classification network, but I a bit doubt that its classification error is universally as good as the standard softmax network. It is a bit dangerous to build a new model for better detecting out-of-distribution samples, while losing its classification accuracy. Could the authors report the classification accuracy of the proposed classifier on ImageNet data? Some theoretical justifications, if possible, would be great for the issue.\n\n###Output:\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} \n\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I remember that it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The review mentions including a plot comparing SGC and LoRA, which is a specific action. It also gives a clear method for how to do it by specifying the axes. That seems pretty actionable because the authors know exactly what to do. So I think this is highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity** looks at how specific the review is about the paper. The review points out a specific claim about SGC's flexibility and suggests a visualization. It doesn't make general comments but directly addresses the method mentioned in the paper. Plus, it specifies what kind of plot to include, which is pretty specific. So I'd rate this as 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that including a specific plot would demonstrate the benefits. It doesn't cite external references or provide logical reasoning beyond suggesting the plot. However, it's clear and provides a method, so it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe a 4 because it's not the most thorough but still helpful.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness** is about how useful the review is overall. It offers a clear suggestion with a specific method, which is very helpful. It doesn't seem vague or lacking in guidance. So I'd give this a 5 because it's comprehensive and constructive.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. The review is clear, specific, and provides actionable steps, making it highly helpful and grounded. It's also verifiable enough to add value without needing external references.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors stacked two methods and used DBSCAN. But it doesn't specify what the issue is or how this approach improves or needs improvement. It's pretty vague. So, I don't think this is actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. It's more like a statement than a clear action. So, I'd rate this as 1 (Unactionable).\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about stacking methods and using DBSCAN but doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. It's unclear. There's no mention of a specific section or figure, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. This means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. So, I'd give it a 1 (Not Grounded).\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just describes the methods used without supporting why this is a problem or how it can be improved. There's no reference to external works or logical reasoning, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1 (Unverifiable).\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: Since the review doesn't clearly identify any issues or provide actionable suggestions, it's not helpful at all.

The action is explicit\u2014 authors need to give examples and explain the model. The instructions are clear, so this is explicit action. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells exactly what to do: add examples, explain the model, and include it in the appendix. So, it's highly actionable. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figure 1 and asks about \"support data\" and \"predicted training count data.\" It doesn't specify which part of the figure or what exactly to add. The grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where to add the data or what to write. However, it does clearly specify what needs to be addressed, which is specificity. So, it's grounding-specific but not fully grounded. I'm leaning towards a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is asking for examples and model explanation. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back up these suggestions. It's vague and lacks justification, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about what the authors need to do but doesn't provide any examples or detailed explanations. It's somewhat helpful because it points out areas for improvement, but it's not as helpful as it could be. So, a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For grounding_specificity, the comment doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper, so weak grounding. But it does specify what needs to be addressed, so it's specific. That makes it 3.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a discussion about moment matching in DRL, citing a specific paper. It doesn't tell the author exactly where to add this discussion or how to implement it. So, it's explicit in pointing out a need but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the review mentions a specific paper and clearly states what's missing. It accurately points out the need to discuss moment matching, so it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nLooking at **verifiability**, the claim is that moment matching should be discussed. The support includes a specific citation, which is good, but it doesn't explain why moment matching is better or provide examples. It's somewhat justified but not fully, so **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting a specific addition and provides a reference. It's helpful because it guides the author to improve their work, though it could be more detailed. So, it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It can be tested on a smaller subset of RepoEval, and it is essential to compare with these state-of-the-art code completion systems.\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Each of these has specific definitions and criteria, so I should go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests comparing with Copilot and testing on a smaller subset. Is this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors exactly what to do. But is it concrete? It gives a specific example (Copilot) and a method (testing on a subset). So it's both explicit and concrete. But the score was 3. Hmm, maybe because it's a bit vague on how to implement the comparison? Or perhaps it's not clear enough on the evaluation metrics? I'm not sure, but according to the initial assessment, it's 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions Copilot and RepoEval. Is it specific? It does mention specific applications and datasets, so I think it's grounded. It's not just a general suggestion but points to particular parts of the paper. So the score is 3 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment provides specific examples (Copilot) and mentions testing on a subset. This seems supported by external references (like Copilot being a known system) and logical reasoning about testing on a smaller dataset. So it's somewhat verifiable, hence a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The suggestion is clear and provides specific comparisons, which should help the authors improve. However, it might not cover all possible areas where the code completion could be improved, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive. Hence, a 3.\n\nI think each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review point guides the authors, providing clear actions, specific references, verifiable claims, and overall helpful suggestions. Even though some aspects could be better, they still offer enough guidance to be considered helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that shift=0 is better than a normal distribution but doesn't explain why. It also suggests showing performance on test samples. The action here is pointing out the difference and suggesting an experiment. But the explanation is vague\u2014why is shift=0 better? It doesn't give a clear reason or how to implement the suggestion. So, it's explicit in pointing out the action but vague on the details. That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"shift=0\" and \"test samples from the observational (in) distribution.\" It's specific about the parts of the paper, so it's fully grounded. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is specific. So, grounding_specificity gets a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that shift=0 is better and suggests an experiment. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest an improvement but lacks details. It doesn't explain why shift=0 is better or how the experiment will help. It's vague and doesn't offer substantial guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully, which is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions, and the scores reflect the clarity, specificity, justification, and overall usefulness of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the model's use of multiple INs at different speeds is important and asks if one IN would suffice. It's explicit about the design choice and provides a clear action: evaluating the necessity of multiple INs. However, it doesn't give concrete steps on how to assess this, so it's somewhat actionable but not fully detailed. I think this should be a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific part of the model (multiple INs) and clearly states what's being questioned (importance and redundancy). It doesn't mention external references or other parts of the paper, but it's precise about the section. So this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why multiple INs are necessary. It just asks a question without supporting reasoning or references. So it's not verifiable at all, which would be a 1, but since it's a claim, maybe it's X because there's no claim without justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the design choice and asks a relevant question, which helps the authors think about their model. However, it doesn't provide specific guidance on how to proceed, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'll rate this a 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the opponent doesn't aim to maximize the multi-agent payoff because they maximize classical SE and AE. It suggests this as a reason. Is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a reason but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. So, it's implicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how to address this or what changes to make. So, it's not concrete. Therefore, it's borderline actionable. I think a 2 makes sense here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about the opponent maximizing classical SE and AE. They mention specific terms like SE and AE, which are parts of the paper. So, the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the issue without needing to infer. That's full grounding. Also, they explain what's wrong clearly, so it's specific. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer states that the opponent maximizes SE and AE, which are well-known concepts. They don't provide external references, but the explanation is clear and logical. So, it's somewhat verifiable. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer explains why the opponent's approach is different but doesn't suggest specific fixes. It's clear and provides some insight, so it's somewhat helpful. A 3 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 2, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It also says the authors aren't held accountable. I think the comment is pointing out a problem but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They might not know how to adjust their methods or what changes to make. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which isn't very actionable. I'd rate this as 1 because it's not helpful for the authors to act on.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about ASAP methods not resembling biological networks and mentions the weight transport problem. It seems like it's referring to a specific issue, so the grounding is probably weak. It doesn't clearly state which part of the paper it's addressing, and it's a bit vague about the implications. So, I'd give this a 3 because it's somewhat grounded but not fully clear.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment makes a claim that ASAP methods don't resemble biological networks, but it doesn't provide any evidence or justification for this. It's just a statement without supporting references or logical reasoning. So, it's not verifiable. I'd score this as 1 because there's no backing to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't guide the authors on how to proceed. Since it's not providing actionable steps or evidence, it's not very helpful. I'd rate this a 2 because it's barely helpful at best, just pointing out a problem without solutions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the motivation in the introduction with low-rank factorization is unnecessary for the main result about polytopes. It also suggests that if the result has implications for low-rank matrix factorization, they should be discussed. The action here is clear: the authors should remove the unnecessary motivation and discuss implications if any. The instructions say that explicit actions are actionable. So, this is an explicit action, making it actionable. However, the review doesn't specify exactly how to remove the motivation or where to discuss the implications, so it's vague on the implementation. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable (3)**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the introduction and mentions low-rank factorization. It doesn't explicitly name a specific part of the paper beyond the introduction. The mention is general, so the grounding is weak. However, it does clearly identify the issue with the motivation, which is specific enough. So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific (3)**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that the motivation is unnecessary and suggests discussing implications. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support these claims. It's vague and lacks justification, so it's **Unverifiable (1)**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out an unnecessary part and suggests discussing implications. While it provides some direction, it's vague and doesn't offer concrete steps. It's somewhat helpful but not very detailed. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful (3)**.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper is incremental and compares it to [31]. It mentions the authors adapted an architecture for a multi-person case, producing heatmaps. But it doesn't tell the authors what to do next or how to improve. It's more of a critique without actionable steps. So, it's not explicit or vague, but it doesn't give clear instructions. I think this is borderline actionable because it hints at a problem but doesn't specify how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to [31] but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper that relates to. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where to look or what's missing. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly point to the specific section or issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions that the paper is incremental and references another work. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the paper is incremental or why [31] is relevant. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. It's more of an opinion without support.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a problem but doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the experiments should be more comprehensive and general. It mentions that the model size is limited and the baselines are restrictive for both tasks. Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. \n\nLooking at the definitions, an explicit action would be something like recommending a specific change, while an implicit one is more vague. Here, the reviewer is suggesting improvements but doesn't specify exactly what to do. They mention making the experiments more comprehensive but don't give concrete steps. So, it's not fully explicit. It's also not vague because they do point out specific issues with model size and baselines. Hmm, so maybe it's somewhere in between. I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because they do suggest changes but don't detail how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review talks about both tasks, language modeling and image classification, and mentions model size and baselines. It seems like they are accurately pinpointing the sections being discussed. They don't just say \"the experiments are bad,\" but rather specify where the issues lie. So, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because they do address specific parts and clearly state what's wrong.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the experiments are limited and restrictive. But it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it doesn't meet the criteria for being verifiable. This would be **1: Unverifiable** because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out areas for improvement but doesn't give detailed suggestions on how to make the experiments more comprehensive. It's somewhat vague, so while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed. I think this falls under **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify issues but lacks specifics on how to fix them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability: 3, grounding_specificity: 3, verifiability: 1, helpfulness: 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the framework is somewhat limited in scope, considering only three Q&A tasks and two language models. It suggests that the method's applicability is restricted. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the review is pointing out a limitation but doesn't specify how to address it or what changes should be made. It's more of a critique than a directive. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat explicit but vague on how to improve.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the framework's limitations but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to. It mentions three tasks and two models but doesn't specify what those tasks or models are in relation to the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact area. It's vague, so I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the framework's scope is limited but doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's just an opinion without backing. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or references. Maybe a 3 here since it's somewhat a claim but lacks justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's more of a critique without actionable advice. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nOverall, the review is somewhat clear but lacks concrete actions or justifications, making it somewhat helpful but not highly so.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says the experiments aren't sufficient and suggests more empirical or toy experiments. It also mentions citing Kaplan et al. 2020. The action here is clear: do more experiments and cite a reference. It's explicit, so that's good. The instructions say authors need to know exactly what to do, which they do\u2014conduct more experiments and reference the paper. So this is highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment talks about experiments and cites a specific paper. It doesn't just say \"more experiments,\" it specifies empirical and toy ones, which are parts of the paper. It also mentions citing a particular reference, which is a unique element. So the grounding is strong because it points to specific sections or elements. I think this is fully grounded and specific, so another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests more experiments and cites a paper. It's making a claim that the current experiments are insufficient, which needs support. The suggestion to do more experiments is logical, and citing the paper adds external support. However, it doesn't provide detailed reasoning or examples beyond the citation. So it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'll rate it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review points out a clear need for more experiments and provides a specific citation. It's actionable and gives a clear direction for the authors. While it could be expanded, it's already quite helpful. So I'll give it a 5.\n\nOverall, the review is clear, specific, and provides actionable feedback with some minor gaps in justification, making it highly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

It provides a specific action by suggesting a method to implement this change. That seems pretty explicit. It also gives concrete details on how to apply the change, like mentioning the specific metric and referencing a paper. So, this should be highly actionable because the reviewer is not just pointing out a problem but giving a clear plan on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to a specific part of the literature by mentioning [C], which is the Inception network. It's not just a vague statement but specifically points to a reference. Additionally, it suggests using a different metric, which is a concrete action. So, this is fully grounded because it clearly references a specific part of the paper and provides a specific solution.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that using DinoV2 Frechet Distances is a better metric than FIDs. It supports this claim by citing [C], which is the Inception network. However, it doesn't provide a detailed explanation of why DinoV2 is better or how it works. It just mentions it as a reference. So, while it's somewhat justified, there's a bit more depth needed to fully verify the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a clear suggestion to improve the evaluation method. It provides a specific alternative metric and references a paper, which should help the authors make an informed decision. While it's helpful, it could be more detailed, but overall, it's mostly helpful because it gives actionable feedback.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect is scored based on these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests adding experiments where the image is occluded. It mentions two purposes: simulating data irregularity and inspecting the model's inference capacity. The reviewer also states that these are easy experiments to run. This seems explicit because the reviewer is directly telling the authors what to do. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer provides specific tasks but doesn't give detailed instructions on how to implement each experiment. For example, they mention random blacking out but don't specify how much of the image to obscure or how to analyze the results. So, while the action is clear, the details are vague. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because the action is explicit, but the implementation isn't fully detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about occluding parts of the image and mentions simulating data irregularity and model inference. They don't explicitly name the specific sections of the paper, but they do refer to unique aspects like keypoint detection failures and inference capacity. This seems like they can accurately pinpoint the areas without needing external references. So, the grounding is strong because they can identify the specific part of the paper being addressed. The specificity is also good because they explain what needs to be addressed in those parts, like simulating data issues and testing inference capabilities. Therefore, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The reviewer's claim is that adding these experiments would be beneficial. They provide some reasoning: simulating data irregularity is common, and testing inference capacity makes the model more robust. However, they don't cite any external references or provide concrete examples. Their reasoning is logical but lacks specific evidence or references. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. This would fall under **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer provides clear suggestions for experiments and explains their benefits. They mention that these are easy to run and would improve the model's capabilities. The feedback is actionable and directly addresses potential weaknesses in the current setup. While it could be expanded with more details, it's still highly helpful because it guides the authors on what to do. So, this should be **Highly Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: 3 (Somewhat Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 5 (Highly Helpful)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using a second y-axis or another visualization. That's pretty explicit, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The suggestion is to use a second y-axis, which is specific. So, I think this is highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to do. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions figure 6C and suggests a specific solution. It clearly identifies the part of the paper (figure 6C) and what needs to be done. So, it's fully grounded and specific. That's a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the suggestion is to use a second y-axis. While it's a good suggestion, I'm not sure if there's any external reference or specific example provided. It's more of a general recommendation. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out an issue with figure 6C and suggests an improvement. It's clear and provides a specific change. While it's not the most detailed, it's still helpful. So, I'll give it a 4.\n\nI think that's all. Let me just double-check each aspect to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point: \"It seems that there is still room to improve the complexity of Algorithm 2;\". The user has provided a structure to output the scores for four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Each aspect has its own scale from 1 to 5, with explanations for each score.\n\nStarting with actionability. The definition says actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The point mentions that there's room to improve Algorithm 2's complexity but doesn't specify how. So, it's an explicit action (implying improvement is needed) but vague on the specifics. According to the scale, 2 is borderline actionable because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement the change. So, I'll assign 2 to actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This is about how specific the review is regarding the paper's part. The review talks about Algorithm 2 but doesn't mention which section or part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague, so it doesn't ground the feedback specifically. Therefore, it's not grounded at all, which is a score of 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is a claim that Algorithm 2 needs improvement but doesn't support it with evidence or reasoning. There's no justification given for why the complexity needs improvement or any references. So, it's unverifiable, scoring 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out a weakness (Algorithm 2's complexity) but doesn't provide any specific suggestions or details on how to improve it. It's vague and lacks actionable steps, so it's barely helpful. Therefore, a score of 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 2, grounding_specificity: 1, verifiability: 1, helpfulness: 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point: \"The contribution of multilingual chain-of-thought is incremental compared to the villa chain-of-though.\" Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review is pointing out that multilingual chain-of-thought is incremental, but it doesn't tell the authors what exactly they should do next. It's just a statement without any suggestions or actions. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to improve it. I think this should be labeled as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions \"multilingual chain-of-thought\" and \"villa chain-of-though.\" It's clear which parts it's referring to, so the grounding is solid. It also explains the difference, which adds specificity. So, grounding specificity should be 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a claim that multilingual is incremental compared to villa. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. There's no reference to external studies or common knowledge, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a difference but doesn't provide any actionable suggestions. It's just a comparison without context or improvement ideas. So, it's not very helpful. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are all 1s except grounding specificity which is 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"You should provide the METEOR results, which is also reported in recent works [1-5].\" I remember from the definition that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. It should tell the author exactly what to do.\n\nLooking at this comment, it's suggesting the author should provide METEOR results, referencing recent works. But it doesn't specify how or where to include these results. It's a bit vague. So, is this explicit or implicit? I think it's explicit because it's stating a clear action, but it's not giving detailed instructions on how to implement it. So, maybe it's 4 on the actionability scale because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper part it's addressing. The comment here is about providing METEOR results, which is a tool, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or where to include them. It's pretty vague. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the exact section or figure. Therefore, I'd rate this as 1 for grounding_specificity because it's not grounded at all.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is making a claim by suggesting the author should provide METEOR results. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, METEOR is a known tool used in machine translation, so it's a common knowledge point. However, the comment doesn't provide any justification or examples to back up why the author should provide these results. It's just a suggestion without support. So, this falls under borderline verifiable because there's some support but it's vague.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is suggesting the author should provide METEOR results but doesn't explain why this is necessary or how it helps. It's a bit vague and doesn't offer much actionable advice. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Therefore, I'd rate this as 3 for helpfulness because it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be actionability 4, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The main part can be more concise (especially for the introduction part) and including empirical results.\" It mentions two specific actions: making the introduction more concise and including empirical results. These are both direct actions the authors can take. The instructions say that explicit actions are good because they tell the authors exactly what to do. So this should be highly actionable. I think it's a 5 here.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about making the introduction more concise and including empirical results. But it doesn't specify which part of the introduction or where exactly the conciseness should be applied. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly which section needs to be trimmed or how to incorporate the empirical results. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't pinpoint the specific part. Therefore, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why making the introduction more concise or including empirical results is necessary. It's just a suggestion without any supporting reasoning or references. So, there's no verifiability here. It's unverifiable, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest two concrete actions: making the introduction more concise and including empirical results. It's clear and provides actionable feedback. However, it doesn't offer any reasoning or evidence for why these changes are beneficial. While it's helpful, it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback. So, I'd rate this as 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be improved by adding more justification.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests the author provide additional clarification on how adjusting amplitudes affects model accuracy and explains why these adjustments are effective. It also mentions the spacing in the equations. These are both explicit actions the author can take. Moreover, the review gives clear instructions on what to do, so the action is concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions Figure 3, which is specific, and talks about Equations (9) and (10), which are precise references. The reviewer is pointing out specific parts of the paper, so this is fully grounded. Also, the comments are clear about what needs to be addressed, making it specific. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims about the adjustments affecting model accuracy and the spacing in equations. However, the justification is vague. The reviewer doesn't provide any reasoning or references, just asks for clarification and explanation. Without supporting evidence, the verifiability is somewhat low. I think a 3 is appropriate here because while the claims are made, there's no solid backing provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is clear and directly points out areas for improvement. It provides actionable suggestions, which is helpful. However, it could be more detailed, like adding examples or references, but overall, it's quite useful. So, a 4 seems right as it's mostly helpful but could be improved.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Let me just double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing with CoCoOp, but it's vague about how to do that. It doesn't specify what changes to make or how to implement the comparison. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for a comparison but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions CoCoOp [1] and states it's necessary to include it in experiments. It clearly references a specific part of the paper (related work) and specifies the issue (lack of comparison). So, this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately identifies the section and explains why it's important.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the suggestion is to compare with CoCoOp, but it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this comparison is necessary. It's just a recommendation without supporting reasoning or references. So, this is **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but it's not robust or detailed.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the need for a comparison but doesn't explain why it's important or how it affects the paper's strengths. It lacks depth and doesn't provide actionable steps beyond the suggestion. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it gives a meaningful feedback but doesn't fully address the authors' needs comprehensively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review mentions that \"abbreviations like 'MoCo' should not appear in the section header.\" It suggests removing them because a reader might not know what MoCo stands for. This is explicit, so it's not a guess. The action is clear: remove the abbreviations. Now, is the action detailed? It just says to remove them but doesn't specify how. So, it's explicit but not concrete. I think this should be a 4 because it's clear but lacks detail on the method.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to \"abbreviations like 'MoCo'\" but doesn't specify which section or header it's in. It's just a general suggestion. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's vague, so I'd give this a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion without any justification. It's just recommending removal without explaining why or providing evidence. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is clear and actionable, which is good. It tells the authors to remove abbreviations, which is a specific task. However, it doesn't suggest alternative formatting or where to place the abbreviations if they're needed elsewhere. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I'd rate this a 4 because it's helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The technical contribution is unclear. Most of the analysis are quite standard.\" Hmm, the first part, \"The technical contribution is unclear,\" is a statement of fact, but it doesn't tell the author what to do next. The second part, \"Most of the analysis are quite standard,\" also points out an issue but doesn't suggest an action. So, this isn't giving any explicit or implicit actions. Therefore, it's unactionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the technical contribution is unclear\" and \"most of the analysis are quite standard.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper is unclear or where the standard analysis is lacking. So, the author can't pinpoint exactly what needs improvement. That means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review makes a claim that the technical contribution is unclear and that most analyses are standard. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for these claims. There's no reference to external literature or logical reasoning to support these points. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out issues with the technical contribution and the standard nature of the analysis. However, it doesn't provide specific suggestions on how to improve the paper. It's vague and lacks concrete advice. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful because it doesn't guide the author on actionable steps.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 1 except helpfulness, which scores a 2 because it's somewhat helpful but not fully.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that improvements on different datasets are trivial and that the novelty is limited. It mentions that lots of previous works focus on this topic and that adding topic entities seems incremental. \n\nFor actionability, I'm looking for explicit actions the authors should take. The review does point out that the improvements are trivial and that the novelty is limited, which is a suggestion. However, it doesn't specify exactly what the authors should do next. It just states that the work isn't novel and that the contributions are incremental. So, while there's a suggestion, it's not clear what specific changes the authors should make. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So I think this is a **1: Unactionable** because the action isn't clearly defined.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about previous works and mentions that adding topic entities is incremental. It doesn't specify which part of the paper is being addressed, like a particular section or figure. It's more of a general statement. Also, it doesn't clearly explain what's wrong or what needs to be improved. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint the issue. Therefore, this is a **1: Not Grounded**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the paper's novelty is limited and that improvements are trivial. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for these claims. It just states them without supporting references or logical reasoning. So, the claim is made but not verified. This falls under **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out some issues and suggests that the work isn't novel, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are vague. It mentions that adding topic entities is incremental but doesn't provide specific advice on how to improve the paper beyond that. The feedback is somewhat helpful but lacks depth and clarity.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests adding a background section on RL frameworks, MDPs, trajectories, and policy. It also mentions providing an overview of the DPO algorithm. These are explicit actions the authors should take. The instructions are clear, so the authors know exactly what to do. There's no ambiguity here. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points out the need for a background section but doesn't specify which part of the paper. It just says \"the subsequent sections.\" So, the authors can't pinpoint exactly where to add the background. This means the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the referenced part. However, the comment does specify what needs to be addressed, which is the content of the background section. So, it's somewhat grounded but not fully. I think a 3 here makes sense.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the authors should include certain sections. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support why this is necessary. It's just a statement of what should be done without backing it up. So, it's unverifiable. I'll rate this a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions for the authors, specifying both the background and the DPO algorithm. It's direct and provides actionable steps. While it doesn't go into depth on how to implement these changes, it's still very helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The proposed method may encounter a limitation if the users continuously add new languages because of the limited model capacity.\" It mentions a potential limitation but doesn't specify what needs to be done. So, the authors aren't told how to fix this issue. That makes it **unactionable** because there's no clear direction or solution provided.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about adding new languages causing a limitation. It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper this refers to, like a specific section or figure. So, the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the problem is. This means it's **not grounded** because it doesn't clearly identify the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points out a limitation but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just a statement of a potential problem without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's **unverifiable** because there's no backing to show why this is a concern or how it affects the work.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does identify a potential issue, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer any solutions or further explanation. It's vague and lacks actionable steps, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful because it doesn't empower the authors to improve their work beyond recognizing the problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a 1 except helpfulness, which is a 2 because it's somewhat helpful but not fully.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the simulation study's presentation isn't doing a favor to the authors. It points out that the GPC benchmark is better than BPC because of bandit feedback and not using cost function info. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is giving a reason, so that's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to fix it? Not exactly, but it's a clear direction. So I think this is highly actionable because it's explicit and gives a clear idea of what's missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about the GPC performing better due to bandit feedback and not using cost function info. This clearly references specific parts of the paper, so the grounding is full. They also explain what's missing, which is specific, so this is well-grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer states a claim that GPC is better because of these reasons. They provide logical reasoning about bandit feedback and not using cost info. This is supported by common knowledge about machine learning benchmarks, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a clear issue and provides a reason why it's happening. It's actionable and constructive, so it's highly helpful. It gives the authors a specific direction to improve their method.\n\nSo, all four aspects are scored as 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that perplexity is high but questions the calculation method. It doesn't specify what needs to be done next, like checking the calculation or providing alternative metrics. So, it's not explicit. It's also vague because it doesn't explain how to verify the perplexity. Therefore, it's borderline actionable. I think a 2 makes sense here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 1 and perplexity but doesn't specify which part of the paper or figure this refers to. It's unclear, so it's not fully grounded. However, it does clearly point out a discrepancy, which adds some specificity. So, it's weakly grounded and somewhat specific, which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment raises a question about the calculation method but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a question without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify an issue and asks a relevant question, but it's vague and doesn't provide clear guidance. It's somewhat helpful but not fully. So, a 3 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 2, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors define rooted patterns but doesn't explain why they're important or how they chose the roots. It also mentions a brief discussion or supplementary material as an option. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do\u2014add a discussion or supplementary material. But is it concrete? It does give some direction, so maybe it's 4 or 5. I'll tentatively say 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about rooted patterns and their importance but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be discussed. It's a bit vague, so I think this is weakly grounded. Also, it doesn't clearly detail what needs to be addressed, so it's not fully specific. Maybe a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that rooted patterns are important and suggests a discussion. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. So it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out a missing part in the methodology and suggests solutions. It's actionable and constructive, so it's highly helpful. I'll give it a 4.\n\nWait, but for grounding_specificity, the review does mention rooted patterns, which is a specific part, but it's not clear what exactly needs to be done. So maybe it's weakly grounded. Similarly, the verifiability is low because it's just a judgment without support. So I think grounding_specificity is 3 and verifiability is 3. Actionability is 4 because it's explicit but not fully concrete. Helpfulness is 4 because it's clear and constructive.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests introducing epsilon in equation (11) for clarity. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly where to make the change. The action is clear\u2014introduce epsilon in (11). It's not vague or implicit. So, this should be highly actionable. I think it's a 5 here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions equation (11) but doesn't specify what exactly is wrong with equation (10). It just says epsilon isn't used there. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the issue in equation (10). It's pointing out a part but not the specific problem. Therefore, grounding_specificity should be 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests introducing epsilon for clarity. It's a subjective judgment, so it's a claim. However, there's no justification or evidence provided. It just recommends a change without explaining why or how it helps. So, it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does suggest a specific change, which is helpful. It gives a clear direction for the authors. However, it's not very detailed about why introducing epsilon is better or how it improves clarity. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. So, a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says, \"In Theorem A.3 proof, how the input x has two indices? The input is a vector, not a matrix. Moreover, shouldn\u2019t \u2211 k ( W k ( 2 ) ) 2 = 1 / d , not d ?\" \n\nFirst, I check if the comment is explicit or implicit. The reviewer is directly pointing out that the input x is a vector, not a matrix, and also questioning the equation. That seems explicit because they're clearly stating what's wrong. \n\nNext, is the action clear? The reviewer isn't just pointing out the issue; they're also suggesting that the equation should be 1/d instead of d. So, the action is to correct both the nature of x and the equation. It's not vague; they're giving specific changes. \n\nSo, for actionability, it's definitely more than just pointing out a problem. They're providing clear actions, so it should be a higher score. I think 4 or 5. But since they're not just pointing out the problem but also giving specific fixes, I'll go with 4 because it's mostly actionable but maybe could be more detailed.\n\nMoving on to **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions \"The input is a vector, not a matrix\" and refers to Theorem A.3 proof. It's clear which part of the paper it's addressing because it's referencing a specific theorem and its proof. \n\nThen, it specifies what's wrong with the equation. So, the grounding is strong because it's accurately pinpointing the section and the issue within it. The specificity is also high because it's not just stating a problem but explaining exactly why the equation is incorrect. \n\nSo, this should be a 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment contains claims. The reviewer is stating that the input x is a vector and that the equation should be 1/d. These are opinions or judgments. Now, are these claims supported? \n\nWell, the claim that x is a vector is based on common knowledge in mathematics and machine learning, where inputs are often vectors. The equation correction is also a logical deduction based on standard properties of vectors and matrices. So, the claims are well-supported by logical reasoning and common knowledge. \n\nTherefore, the verifiability is high. It should be a 5 because the claims are thoroughly supported.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment points out two specific issues: the nature of x and the equation. It provides clear corrections, which is helpful for the authors. However, it could be more detailed, like explaining why x is a vector in this context or providing more context about the equation. \n\nBut overall, it's quite helpful. So, a 4 seems appropriate because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nWait, but the initial actionability was 4, but maybe it's 5 because the actions are clear and specific. Hmm, I think I might have been too quick. Let me reevaluate actionability. The reviewer is not just pointing out the problem but also giving specific fixes. So, it's explicit and concrete. Therefore, actionability should be 5.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X (since it's a claim without supporting evidence), and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"It would have been interesting to see not only the retrieved and final attentions but also the tentative attention maps in the qualitative figures.\" I'm trying to see if this gives the authors clear instructions on what to do. It mentions specific things like \"tentative attention maps\" and \"qualitative figures,\" which are concrete. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to improve their draft. It's more of a suggestion than a clear action. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"qualitative figures\" without pointing out which specific part of the paper they're talking about. It's a bit vague. The grounding here is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. But it's not completely vague either; they do mention figures, which is better than nothing. So, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not fully clear but does give some direction.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is just a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It's an opinion or judgment about what would have been interesting. There's no justification or references provided. So, this should be **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing to make it useful for the authors.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is suggesting an improvement but doesn't specify how or why it's beneficial. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does touch on an improvement area but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own score based on how clear, specific, justified, and helpful the review point is.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review suggests changing a set to a multiset in section 4. It mentions that the histogram should include multiplicities. The comment is explicit about the action needed\u2014changing the set to a multiset. It also provides clear guidance on why this change is necessary, which helps the author understand how to implement it. Therefore, this is highly actionable.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe comment specifically refers to section 4 and mentions the need for multiplicities in the graph labels. It doesn't just say \"change the set,\" but rather explains why a multiset is necessary. This makes it grounded because it clearly points to the specific part of the paper and explains the issue. So, it's fully grounded and specific.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe comment suggests a mathematical change (from set to multiset) and explains why multiplicities are needed. While it doesn't cite external references, the reasoning is logical and based on common knowledge about data structures. Therefore, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks explicit external references, so it's rated as 3.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review provides a clear suggestion and explains the reasoning, which is helpful for the author. It guides the author on what needs to be changed without being vague. This makes it highly helpful.\n\nSo, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 5\n- Grounding_specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 3\n- Helpfulness: 5\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors' derivation uses classical learning theory bounds, which don't yield realistic bounds unless Bayesian considerations are added. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They might need to consider Bayesian approaches, but it's not clear. So, it's not giving a direct action, which makes it **unactionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about classical bounds and Bayesian considerations. It doesn't specify which part of the paper is affected or what exactly needs to be changed. It's too vague, so it's **not grounded**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that classical bounds don't yield realistic results without Bayesian methods. It mentions Bayesian-PAC bounds but doesn't provide specific references or examples. It's clear that Bayesian methods are relevant, but without more details, it's **partially verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a limitation but doesn't suggest specific improvements or how to apply the Bayesian approach. It's clear but lacks actionable steps, making it **barely helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the writing could be improved and suggests adding a table to compare CoT prompting methods. It also asks two specific questions about assumptions and selection criteria. The action is clear\u2014adding a table\u2014but the instructions on how to do that aren't detailed. So, it's explicit that they need to add a table, but not how to create it or where to place it. That makes it somewhat actionable because they know what to do, but not exactly how. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to section 4.2 for selection criteria. It's specific about why they're questioning the token and rationale lengths. The mention of section 4.2 makes it grounded because it's pointing to a specific part of the paper. Additionally, it's clear what the issue is with those criteria, so it's specific. That should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims like \"the writing could be improved\" and suggests adding a table. These are clear claims. The justification is that a table would help, but it's not very detailed. There's no external reference or specific examples, so it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest specific improvements and asks clear questions. It's helpful because it points out areas for improvement without being too vague. It's not the most detailed, but it's still useful. So, a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Let me just double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that p(y | H f_bar(tn)) has to be Gaussian for Kalman Filtering and Smoothing and CVI. It also says that this is assumed in the ELBOs anyway. So, the action here is pointing out that the distribution needs to be Gaussian. But the instruction is to give explicit actions. The comment doesn't tell the authors what to do next, like changing the distribution or why it's necessary. It's more of a statement rather than an explicit instruction. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know how to apply this. Maybe they need to adjust their model, but the review doesn't specify how. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does point out an action but lacks detail on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific methods like Kalman Filtering and Smoothing and CVI, which are concrete parts of the paper. It also mentions the ELBOs, which are a specific part of the methodology. The grounding here is pretty clear because it's referring to specific technical terms and components of the model. So, the authors can easily identify where the issue lies. The specificity is also good because it's not vague; it's pointing to exact methods. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the distribution needs to be Gaussian for certain methods. The justification is that these methods assume Gaussian distributions, which is a common knowledge point. It's supported by logical reasoning about the requirements of Kalman Filtering and Smoothing. So, the claim is well-supported with common knowledge, making it **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides a clear explanation of why a Gaussian assumption is necessary and references common methods that rely on it. It helps the authors understand a potential limitation of their model. However, it doesn't suggest specific changes or improvements beyond stating the requirement. It's informative but doesn't guide the authors on how to fix it. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully constructive. Therefore, I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests providing illustrative experimental results and a toy dataset to demonstrate the model's performance. It also mentions adding a visualization or schematic diagram for the test metric. These are explicit actions, and the instructions on how to implement them are clear. So, this should be highly actionable. I think it's a 5 here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review points out the lack of experiments and suggests specific experiments and visualizations. It clearly references the sections where these should be added, like the toy dataset in a specific part of the paper. This shows strong grounding because it's specific about where to add the content. So, I'd rate this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides suggestions for experiments and visualizations but doesn't cite any external references or logical reasoning. It's more of a suggestion without solid backing, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review offers clear suggestions for experiments and visualizations, which directly help the authors improve their work. While it's not the most detailed, it's still very helpful. I'd give this a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says the approach description is partially difficult to follow and suggests revising it. It also mentions using an additional page instead of adding more experiments. This is an explicit action, so it's clear what needs to be done. However, the action is vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to revise the description or where to add the page. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the approach description in section 3 and mentions adding a page. It doesn't specify which part of the description is problematic or provide details on how to revise it. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact section or issue. Hence, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claims or opinions. It's just stating what needs to be done without providing evidence or reasoning. So, it's a **No Claim** situation, which is the lowest score here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides some suggestions but lacks clarity and depth. It tells the authors what to do but doesn't explain why or how it helps. This makes it somewhat helpful but not fully so. So, it's a **Somewhat Helpful** score.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is scored based on how well the review point provides actionable feedback, grounds the comments, supports claims, and helps the authors improve their work.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the link between IP and the terms/equations should be explained more explicitly and prominently. It also mentions including labels for subfigures in Figs 3 and 4 instead of just stating it in the captions. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is suggesting specific changes: making the explanation more explicit, making it prominent, adding labels to subfigures, and not just relying on captions. These are all clear actions the authors can take. There's no ambiguity here; the actions are well-defined. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"the link between IP and the terms/equations\" and \"labels for subfigures in Figs 3 and 4.\" It doesn't mention specific sections or figures beyond that. The reviewer is pointing out areas that require attention but isn't pinning down exactly which part of the paper or figure. So, while it's not entirely vague, it's not fully specific either. I think this falls under fully grounded but not specific, so a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the link needs to be more explicit and suggesting specific changes. However, there's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. It's just a statement of what needs to be done without backing it up. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary justification. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions for improvement but doesn't go into detail about why these changes are necessary or how they will help. It's helpful in that it points out areas for improvement, but it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback. So, it's mostly helpful, which I'll rate as a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"Results should be averaged over multiple runs to determine statistical significance.\" I remember that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do: average the results. But wait, does it give any guidance on how to do that? It just says to average them, which is pretty vague. So, it's explicit but not very detailed on the method. I think this would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done, but it's not very concrete on the steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It just suggests averaging results, which isn't tied to a particular section or figure. So, the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. This means the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. Therefore, this would be a **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting averaging results. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable. This should be a **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment is pointing out a methodological issue but doesn't explain why it's important or how it affects the paper. It's vague and doesn't provide substantial feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. This would be a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Let me just double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"In my opinion, the contribution of this paper appears somewhat limited, and the proposed model seems incremental in its approach.\" The author is expressing an opinion about the paper's contribution and the model's approach. But there's no specific action suggested. The reviewer isn't telling the authors what to do or how to improve. So, this is more of a general statement without any actionable steps. Therefore, it's not actionable because there's no clear direction for the authors to follow. So, I'd rate actionability as 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions the paper's contribution and the model's approach but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is limited or incremental. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issues are, so the grounding is weak. There's no specific section, table, or figure mentioned, and it's not clear what needs to be addressed. So, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review contains a claim that the contribution is limited and the model is incremental. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for these claims. The reviewer is just stating their opinion without backing it up with references or logical reasoning. So, it's not verifiable because there's no proof provided. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out some issues with the paper's contribution and the model. It gives the authors something to think about. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide specific suggestions or details on how to improve. The feedback is there but lacks depth and specificity. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful because it doesn't guide the authors effectively. Therefore, helpfulness is 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat critical but lacks specific actions, clear grounding, verifiable evidence, and detailed suggestions. It's helpful but not highly so.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper verifies different metrics for different OPE methods and points out differences in Figure 4 and 5. It ends with a request for comments on the differences between evaluation methods. Explicitly, it's asking for a discussion, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify how to apply this action, like suggesting improvements or pointing out specific issues. So, it's explicit but lacks detail, making it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 4 and 5 by name, which is a clear mention of specific parts of the paper. It also talks about differences in evaluation methods, which are specific aspects. Therefore, it's fully grounded and specific, giving it a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment about the differences in evaluation methods but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's a claim without supporting evidence, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some justification but lacks key elements like examples or references.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and provides specific areas for discussion. It doesn't offer too many details, but it's actionable enough to guide the authors. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it's helpful but could be expanded.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring that each label is justified.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review points are:\na. Need to report average over multiple runs. Results are very close together and it is hard to favor one method.\nb. Sec. 3.1: Since this is the toy-dataset, a discussion why the decision boundaries look as they do, would be interesting.\nc. Sec. 3.3: What information is in Fig. 9 middle and right?\n\nFor each of these, I need to determine if the action is explicit and concrete. \n\nPoint a suggests reporting an average and mentions that the results are close, making it hard to choose a method. This is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. It's also concrete because it specifies the action (reporting averages) and the reason (close results). So this should be highly actionable.\n\nPoint b asks for a discussion on decision boundaries in a toy dataset. It's explicit about the section (3.1) and what to discuss. However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify how to discuss it or what aspects of the decision boundaries to focus on. But since it's clear what needs to be done, it's still actionable, just maybe a bit less specific. I think this would be highly actionable as well.\n\nPoint c asks about the information in specific figures. Again, it's explicit about the section (3.3) and what to look at (Fig. 9). It doesn't specify how to analyze the figures, which could make it a bit vague. But since the action is clear, it's still actionable. Maybe it's a 4 because it's somewhat vague on the analysis method.\n\nMoving to **grounding_specificity**. This looks at whether the review points clearly reference specific parts of the paper.\n\nPoint a talks about reporting averages in the experimental section. It doesn't explicitly mention the section, but since it's part of the experimental section, it's somewhat clear. It does explain what needs to be done, so it's grounded but maybe not fully.\n\nPoint b refers to Sec. 3.1, which is specific. It also mentions a toy dataset, which is a specific context. So this is fully grounded because it points to a specific section and context.\n\nPoint c mentions Fig. 9 and specific parts of it. It's explicit about the figure and sections, so this is fully grounded.\n\nFor **verifiability**, we need to see if the claims are supported by evidence.\n\nPoint a suggests reporting averages. This is a clear claim, and the reasoning is logical\u2014close results make it hard to choose. It doesn't reference external studies, but the logic is solid, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nPoint b recommends discussing decision boundaries. This is a clear suggestion, but it doesn't provide specific references or examples. It's logical but lacks supporting evidence, so it's borderline verifiable.\n\nPoint c asks about the information in figures. Again, it's a clear request but doesn't provide specifics or references, so it's borderline verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. This is about how much the review point helps the authors.\n\nPoint a is very helpful because it gives a clear action and reason. It's actionable and specific.\n\nPoint b is helpful but could be improved. It suggests an improvement but doesn't specify how, so it's somewhat helpful.\n\nPoint c is helpful but vague. It tells the authors what to look at but doesn't specify how, so it's somewhat helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each point contributes to different aspects, and the scores reflect how well each part meets the criteria.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the new model can only be used with a small number of dimensions because of the curse of dimensionality. It suggests that the authors should consider this limitation. Now, is this actionable? Well, it does tell the authors to consider the limitation, which is an explicit action. But does it give them a clear idea of what to do? Not really. They know the model is limited but don't get guidance on how to address it or what alternatives to consider. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement the change. That makes it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the curse of dimensionality but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's unclear if it's talking about the model, the core tensor, or something else. Since it doesn't pinpoint the exact section or issue, it's not fully grounded. It's just a general statement without clear reference, so it's **Not Grounded**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states a fact about the curse of dimensionality but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a claim without supporting evidence. So, it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't offer any suggestions or guidance on how to overcome it. It's a straightforward criticism without any constructive advice. Therefore, it's **Not Helpful at All**.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a score of 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

As mentioned in the review, it is a weak, unpractical bound, and the proof, in itself, does not provide particular mathematical novelty.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the paper's claim about the \"picking\" step is not ablated, which is an explicit action. It also points out issues in the experiments on CIFAR, which is another explicit action. However, it doesn't specify how to implement these changes, so it's more about identifying the problem rather than providing detailed steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit and detailed. So, I'd rate this as 4.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific experiments on the CIFAR dataset and mentions the continual learning literature, which are specific parts of the paper. It also suggests using the same setup as the DEN paper, which is a specific reference. This shows that the review is well-grounded because it accurately points to the relevant sections and provides clear suggestions. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes claims about the lack of ablation for the \"picking\" step and the unfair comparison on CIFAR. It provides some justification by citing the extensive experiments in the continual learning literature and the need for a fair comparison. However, it doesn't cite specific external references or provide detailed reasoning for why the comparison is unfair. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth. So, I'd give this a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is clear in pointing out specific weaknesses and provides actionable suggestions. It helps the authors by guiding them on what needs improvement without being vague. The suggestions are specific enough to be useful, even though they could be expanded a bit. Overall, it's highly helpful because it directly addresses the issues and offers meaningful feedback. So, this should be a 5.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the review point's content.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests making the text in legends and axis labels larger. It also mentions that Proposition (1) is confused with Equation 1 and suggests making the captions and legend's font size similar to the text in Fig. 2 and 3. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out specific areas to change, like the font size in legends and captions. That's explicit. However, the suggestion to make Proposition (1) similar to Equation 1 isn't very specific. It could mean a few things, like changing the font size or style, but it's vague. So, it's not fully actionable because part of the comment is vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about making the text in legends and axis labels larger, which is specific. They also mention captions and font sizes, which are clearly pinpointed in the figure. So, the grounding is strong because they're accurately identifying the parts of the paper. The specificity is also good because they're not just saying \"improve the paper\" but pointing out exact elements that need attention. So, this should be a higher score here.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The comment is about improving the clarity of Proposition (1) and the font size in captions. There's no claim here; it's just a suggestion. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiability. So, this should be marked as \"X\" for no claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides specific suggestions about font sizes and clarifying Proposition (1). These are actionable and directly address issues the author might face. While it could be more detailed, it's still helpful. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the highest.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect that actionability is somewhat actionable, grounding is fully grounded and specific, verifiability isn't applicable, and helpfulness is somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing counterfactual experiments with Journey TRAK, specifically mentioning Figure 2 from [1]. It's explicit about the action, which is to compare, but it's vague on how to implement it. They don't specify the exact step in the sampling trajectory or how to analyze the results. So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the details are missing. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific figure from an external source, which is good. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, so that's fully grounded. Also, it specifies what needs to be addressed, which is comparing the effects. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests a comparison with a specific figure from an external paper. While it's a good suggestion, it doesn't provide any justification or reasoning for why this comparison is necessary or how it supports the claims. It's just a recommendation without backing, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting a specific comparison and references an external figure. It provides a clear direction for the authors, even though it's somewhat vague. This should be **4: Mostly Helpful** because it gives actionable feedback but could be more detailed.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring that each score accurately reflects the quality of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests analyzing disparities between IGEV and other baselines and questions if Sampling-Gaussian can improve iterative frameworks. The action is clear\u2014analyze and question. But the instructions say to be explicit or implicit. Here, the actions are explicit, so that's good. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer tells the author exactly what to do: analyze disparities and question the improvement difficulty. So it's not vague. Therefore, this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while the actions are explicit, maybe they could be more detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions IGEV and SOTA methods, which are specific. They also ask the author to analyze disparities, which is a specific part of the paper. The grounding is clear because they're referring to specific methods and sections. The specificity is also good because they're not just saying \"something is wrong\" but pointing to exact areas. So this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the improvement over SOTA is small, which implies something about the distribution. They suggest analyzing disparities, which is a clear justification. They also ask if it's difficult for Sampling-Gaussian to improve, which is another justification. The evidence is logical and provides some reasoning, so it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe it's not fully robust because it's more of a suggestion than a concrete reference, but it's better than unverifiable. So I'll give it **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides specific suggestions and questions, which is good. They don't just say the method isn't great but ask targeted questions about specific areas. This should be helpful but not the most detailed. So **4: Mostly Helpful** seems right because it's clear and actionable but could be expanded.\n\nI think that's a solid evaluation based on the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests clarifying whether Fourier modes are reals or complex. That's a direct action, so it's explicit. The comment also gives a clear direction on how to implement it by specifying the clarification needed. So, it's both explicit and concrete. That should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Fourier modes as numbers and asks for clarification on their type. It doesn't refer to a specific section or table, but it's clear about what part needs addressing\u2014their nature (real or complex). So, it's fully grounded because it accurately identifies the part of the paper being discussed, and it's specific about the issue. That's a 5 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that Fourier modes can be either real or complex and suggests clarifying this point. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's a claim without any backing, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific issue and asking for clarification. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful. While it doesn't provide extensive suggestions, it does offer a meaningful improvement direction. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nWait, but the initial evaluation said helpfulness was 5. Hmm, maybe I was too hasty. Let me think again. The comment is clear and directly points out a specific issue, which is helpful. It doesn't provide a lot of depth, but it's still useful. Maybe it's better to give it a 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded. Alternatively, if it's clear and actionable, maybe 5 is justified. I'm a bit confused now. I'll stick with 5 because it's a clear and direct suggestion, even if it's not the most comprehensive.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests changing Figure 5.1 to Figure 1 and mentions moving the LaTeX label. This is explicit because it tells the author exactly what to do. The action is clear, and the instructions are straightforward without ambiguity. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"Fig. 1\" and \"Fig. 5.1\" by number, which is specific. It doesn't mention sections or tables by name, but it's clear enough. The part about LaTeX label placement is also specific. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment provides a clear instruction on how to fix the figure. It doesn't rely on external references or logical reasoning beyond the given steps. It's somewhat verifiable because it's a direct instruction without needing further justification. \n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment directly points out the issue and provides a solution. It's clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful. It doesn't leave the author with questions or require them to infer the fix.\n\nSo, each aspect scores highly, with actionability and grounding being the highest, followed by verifiability and helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

However, it does not specify how to implement this change or what metrics to use for comparison. Therefore, it is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because the action is clear but lacks detail on implementation.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - The review points out the need to include specific results (GCPG model without pre-trained initializations) but does not clearly identify which part of the paper this refers to. It mentions the task formulation and pre-trained models but does not specify a unique section or figure. Thus, it is **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does not fully pinpoint the referenced part but clearly states what needs to be addressed.\n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   - The review suggests adding results from a specific model (GCPG) but does not provide any justification or references. It lacks supporting evidence, making it **3: Somewhat Verifiable** as it mentions a claim (the need to include results) but lacks sufficient justification.\n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   - The review provides a clear suggestion to include specific results but does not elaborate on why this is necessary or how it would improve the paper.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a reference next to baseline names in tables and clarifies that \u03a9 isn't explicitly defined but is easy to infer. Explicitly telling authors what to do is explicit actionability. Also, providing clear instructions on where to add a reference and defining \u03a9 as an inferred action makes this highly actionable. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions adding a reference next to specific table names and explains \u03a9 by analogy. It clearly points to the sections being discussed, so it's fully grounded. Also, explaining \u03a9 by analogy makes it specific. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review offers practical advice on where to add a reference and defines \u03a9 with a simple explanation. While it's clear, it doesn't cite external sources or provide deeper reasoning, so it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and gives specific instructions, which is helpful. It guides the authors on formatting and clarifying a term, which is useful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the framework is a simple combination of two existing methods and that there's no technical contribution. It doesn't suggest any specific changes or improvements. So, there's no explicit action or guidance for the authors. It's unclear what the authors should do next. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions that the framework is a combination of meta-learning and federated learning but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is lacking. It's too vague about pinpointing the issue. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. I'd give this a 1 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that there's no technical contribution but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. It's just a general statement without supporting references or logical reasoning. Therefore, it's not verifiable. This also gets a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a lack of technical contribution but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors in their work. So, it's not helpful at all. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nOverall, the review is quite vague and doesn't provide actionable or well-supported feedback, so all four aspects are scored as 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the caption for Figure 7 is incorrect and should be \"Edge Dynamics\" instead of \"Node Dynamics\". This is pretty explicit, so it's an explicit action. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly which part to change and what to change it to. There's no ambiguity here, so it's definitely actionable. Therefore, this should be a high score, probably 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions that the caption is incorrect and specifies the correct term. It doesn't leave any room for guessing. The authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is without any confusion. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That would also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is pointing out a factual error in the caption. It doesn't provide any reasoning or references to back up why the caption is incorrect or why \"Edge Dynamics\" is the right term. It's just a correction without any justification. So, this isn't verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. It should be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest a specific change, which is helpful. However, it's quite brief. It doesn't elaborate on why the change is necessary or how it affects the paper. While it's somewhat helpful, it could be more detailed to be fully helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the standard deviation isn't provided and that the improvement from SoRA is limited due to random fluctuations. It suggests the author clarify which effects are within the SD range and which are improvements. The action here is clear: clarify the effects. It's explicit, so that's good. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells the author exactly what to do. There's no ambiguity. So, it's not vague. Therefore, this should be a higher score. I think 4 or 5. But since it's explicit and concrete, maybe 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out a specific part of the paper\u2014the experimental section\u2014and mentions standard deviation and SoRA. It clearly identifies the issue without guessing. So, it's fully grounded. Also, it specifies what needs to be addressed, which is within the SD and improvements. So, this should be a high score.

It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond stating the problem. It's a bit vague. So, maybe it's somewhat verifiable. I think 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific issue and giving clear suggestions. It's helpful because it guides the author on what to do. It's not too vague, so it's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. Maybe a 4.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Actionability was explicit and concrete, so 4. Grounding was fully grounded and specific, so 5. Verifiability was lacking justification, so 3. Helpfulness was clear and actionable, so 4.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I remember that it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment points out two issues: replacing \"known\" with \"know\" and defining \\gamma_0^{***}, and also asks for a figure caption explanation. \n\nFor the first part, replacing a word, that's straightforward. The reviewer is giving a clear action. But the second part, defining \\gamma_0^{***}, is a bit vague. The reviewer just says \"please define\" without explaining why it's important or how it relates to the paper. So, the action is explicit, but the implementation isn't detailed enough. That makes me think it's **Somewhat Actionable** because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. This is about how specific the comment is. The reviewer mentions specific lines and a figure, which is good. They also ask for a figure caption explanation, which is specific. So, the comment is pointing to exact parts of the paper, which means it's **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**, I need to check if the comment is making a claim and if it's supported. The comment is giving suggestions, not making a judgment, so it's a normal statement. There's no claim here, so it should be marked as **X**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does provide some specific suggestions, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague about why certain changes are needed or how they'll improve the paper. It could be more detailed to be fully helpful.

It also suggests moving 'def.' These are clear actions the authors can take. The comments are explicit and give direct instructions, so that's good. The details are concrete, so I think this is highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like \"dual subdivision\" and \"projection \u03c0,\" which are clearly referenced. It also points out the undefined variable 'p' without explicitly saying it's in the paper, but it's a unique element. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections and variables. The specificity is clear about what needs improvement. I'll rate this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claims made are that the explanations need to be better and that 'p' should be defined. These are based on the authors' own usage throughout the paper, so it's logical and common knowledge. The reasoning is clear, and there's no need for external references. This should be fully verifiable, so a 5 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions and points out specific issues, which is helpful for the authors. It's not too vague but doesn't offer the most comprehensive guidance either. So, it's mostly helpful, which I'll rate as a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking about the rationale behind two modules in a figure. It's not giving any specific actions or suggestions. It's more of a question, so it doesn't provide any actionable feedback. Therefore, it's unactionable, which would be a score of 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figure 1 and asks about specific modules, but it doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. Since it's not clearly pointing to the figure or the modules, it's probably a score of 3, which is weak grounding with some specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making claims about why certain modules are used. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating opinions without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That would be a score of 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking questions but not providing any constructive feedback. It doesn't guide the authors on how to improve their work, so it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Therefore, a score of 3 seems appropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Table 4 is incomplete. It should include the results for all four datasets.\" This is pretty explicit. It tells the authors exactly what's missing and what they need to do. The action is clear\u2014add the missing results. There's no ambiguity here, so it's definitely actionable. I don't see any vague parts; it's straightforward. So, this should be a high score. I think 5 is appropriate because the action is explicit and the details are concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"Table 4\" and specifies that it's \"incomplete\" and should include \"all four datasets.\" This means the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is. They know exactly which table and what data is missing. There's no guessing involved; it's clearly stated. So, this is fully grounded and specific. The specificity is high because it clearly identifies the part of the paper and what's wrong with it. I'd rate this a 5 as well.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review doesn't make any claims or suggestions. It's just stating that Table 4 is incomplete and should include more data. There's no reasoning or references provided. It's a factual statement without any justification. So, this doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability. I think it should be labeled as \"X\" because there's no claim or supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that Table 4 is incomplete and suggests adding more data. While it's a helpful point, it's quite brief. The authors know what's missing but don't get detailed guidance on how to fix it or what changes to make. It's helpful but lacks depth. So, it's better than a 2 but not a 5. I'd rate this a 4 because it's somewhat helpful but could be expanded for more actionable advice.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

However, the assumption that PCC is a more relaxed constraint compared with KL divergence because of its invariance to scale and shift is not convincing enough. The constraint strength of a loss function is defined via its gradient distribution. For example, KL divergence and MSE loss have the same optimal solution while MSE loss is stricter than KL because of stricter punishment according to its gradient distribution. From this perspective, it is necessary to provide the gradient comparison between KL and PCC.\n\nLet's evaluate each aspect step by step.\n\n**Actionability:**\n- The review points out a limitation of using PCC compared to KL divergence, suggesting that the constraint strength should be evaluated via gradient distributions.\n- It provides a clear action: \"It is necessary to provide the gradient comparison between KL and PCC.\"\n- The action is explicit and directly instructs the authors on what to do.\n- The action is concrete because it specifies exactly what needs to be done.\n- Therefore, this review is highly actionable.\n\n**Grounding Specificity:**\n- The review refers to \"Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)\" and \"Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL)\" by name, which are specific metrics.\n- It mentions the \"gradient distribution\" as a key aspect of loss functions, which is a specific feature.\n- The grounding is explicit and precise, clearly identifying the metrics and the concept being discussed.\n- Therefore, this review is fully grounded and specific.\n\n**Verifiability:**\n- The review contains a claim: \"The constraint strength of a loss function is defined via its gradient distribution.\"\n- This claim is supported by examples: \"KL divergence and MSE loss have the same optimal solution while MSE loss is stricter than KL because of stricter punishment according to its gradient distribution.\"\n- The reasoning is logical and provides clear justification for the claim.\n- The references (e.g., MSE loss having stricter punishment) are specific and well-supported.\n- Therefore, the claim is thoroughly verified, making the review fully verifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\n- The review identifies a limitation in the use of PCC and suggests a specific improvement (comparing gradients with KL).\n- The suggestions are clear and actionable for the authors.\n- While it could be expanded to include more examples or a broader discussion, the current content is sufficient to be highly helpful.\n- Therefore, the review is highly helpful.\n\nThe scores are:\n- Actionability: 5\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 5\n- Helpfulness: 5\n\nHowever, the initial assessment provided by the user had different scores.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The performance gains are not very high, more most of the metrics the different between the baseline (w/o caption + w/o warmup) and best approach (with caption + warmup) is less than 1%.\" Hmm, this is pointing out a problem but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's more of a statement than a suggestion. So, the authors don't know what changes to make. That makes it unactionable because there's no clear direction for improvement. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions metrics and specific changes like adding captions and warmup, but it doesn't tie these to a particular part of the paper. It's too vague about which sections or aspects are affected. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review states that the performance gains are not high, but it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. There's no reference to external studies or common knowledge to support this observation. So, it's not verifiable. That gives it a 1 in verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem but doesn't offer specific suggestions or explain why the performance gains are low. It lacks actionable advice, so the authors don't know what steps to take. This makes it not very helpful. So, helpfulness is a 1 as well.\n\nOverall, the review is quite vague and doesn't provide clear, actionable feedback, which is why all four aspects are rated as 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

It also mentions the exact lines that are covered by others, so the authors know exactly where the problem is. This seems like **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it clearly identifies the part of the paper and what's wrong with it.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the figures need improvement. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up.

It does give clear directions on what to improve, so that's explicit. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement these changes or what specific modifications are needed. It's somewhat vague on the actions, so I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific references like [9] and [16], which grounds the feedback in the paper. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, like the logic and computational cost. Additionally, it provides examples of why these areas are important, which adds specificity. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the comparison between the proposed method and the references, but it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's vague and lacks justification, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the areas needing improvement and provides some suggestions, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into much detail about how to fix these issues or what specific changes to make. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. So, I'll rate it **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point asks how the PL condition compares with another specific paper. It's a good question, but it's more of a comparison without providing explicit instructions on what to do next. The reviewer is prompting the authors to look into another work but isn't giving a clear action, like suggesting changes or explaining why it's relevant. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still have to figure out what to do themselves. That would make it **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific paper, which is good. It's not just a general statement but refers to a particular work. However, the question is quite broad\u2014it doesn't specify exactly what aspect of the comparison they should focus on. The authors might not know whether to look at the methodology, results, or something else. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does address a specific part but doesn't clearly outline what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the comparison is important or how it relates to the authors' work. It's just a question without supporting reasoning or references. Therefore, it's **X: No Claim** because there's no claim or justification provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question but without any supporting information. It doesn't guide the authors on how to proceed or why this comparison is relevant. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth, making it a **3: Somewhat Helpful** score.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, justification, and guidance provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that AutoAugment's policy is trained on ImageNet and suggests a possible information leakage. It then raises a question about whether the pretraining dataset should match the target dataset for linear classification. However, it doesn't provide explicit instructions on how to fix this or suggest any modifications. So, while it points out an issue, it doesn't give clear actions for the authors to take. That makes it borderline actionable because it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Section 4.2 and mentions AutoAugment's policy. It also brings up a specific point about SSL algorithms and whether combining datasets helps. However, it's a bit vague about which part exactly is problematic. It doesn't clearly pinpoint the section or the exact issue within that section. So, it's weakly grounded because it's not entirely clear which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review does point out a potential issue with information leakage and suggests looking into whether the pretraining dataset should match. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's more of a critique without backing, so it's somewhat verifiable but lacks solid justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises valid concerns about information leakage and the impact on SSL algorithms. It does so in a way that could guide the authors to think about their methodology. However, it doesn't offer concrete solutions or detailed suggestions, so while it's helpful, it's not the most comprehensive feedback.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is only partially addressed, so they all get a 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions adding more analysis on multilingual alignment and suggests visualizations or case studies. It also asks if low-resourced language entities are well-aligned with high-resourced ones. This is pretty explicit, so it's clear what the author should do. The suggestions are concrete, so I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but maybe a bit vague on how exactly to add the analysis.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out a weak analysis on alignment and suggests adding more analysis, visualizations, and case studies. It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper, but it's pretty specific about the types of analysis needed. So I'd say this is **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's clear what needs to be done but doesn't pinpoint the exact section.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the paper has weak analysis and suggests improvements. It provides some reasoning by mentioning adding more analysis and visualizations. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't cite external references or provide concrete examples. So I think this is **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but not enough to be fully convincing.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out specific areas for improvement and giving clear suggestions. It's not overly vague but could be more detailed. Overall, it's helpful because it guides the authors on what to work on, so I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that's a solid evaluation based on the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"Regarding the empirical version of the objective (3), it might be appropriate to put it in the supplementary materials.\" I need to check if this is explicit or implicit. The comment is suggesting where to place the empirical version, which is a direct action. It doesn't ask for clarification but clearly states where to put it. So, it's explicit. Now, is the action concrete? The comment tells the authors exactly where to put it, so yes, it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions \"the empirical version of the objective (3)\" and suggests putting it in the supplementary materials. Grounding is about how specific the comment is. Here, it's explicitly referring to a specific part of the paper, which is objective (3). So, the grounding is full. Specificity refers to how clearly the issue is addressed. The comment clearly states where to place it, so it's specific. Therefore, this should also be a 5.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment is making a suggestion about where to place an empirical version. There's no claim here; it's just a recommendation. Since there's no claim, it doesn't need to be verifiable. So, this should be an X, but since the scale doesn't include X for verifiability, I think it's scored as 1 because it's not a claim and thus not verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment suggests placing an empirical version in supplementary materials. It's a clear and actionable suggestion, so it helps the authors improve their draft. However, it's quite specific and might not cover all possible areas the authors might need. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive. Therefore, a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, since there's no claim, it's X, but the scale for verifiability doesn't have X. So, I think it's 1 because it's not a claim and thus not verifiable. Actionability is 5, grounding is 5, verifiability is 1, and helpfulness is 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests providing a mathematical characterization instead of just mentioning the approximation error. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. Also, it gives a concrete direction on how to implement the change. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the approximation error being ambiguous unless one sees the table. It mentions the gap between objective values but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague because it doesn't clearly identify the section or table. So, it's grounded but not fully specific. Maybe a 4? Wait, no, the definitions say fully grounded and specific is 5, and weakly grounded and specific is 3. Since it's grounded but not specific, I think 4 is correct.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests providing a mathematical characterization. It doesn't give any examples or references, so there's no justification or evidence. It's a claim without support, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and provides a specific improvement direction. It's actionable and gives the authors a clear next step. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. So, a 4 seems right because it's mostly helpful with room for improvement.\n\nWait, let me double-check grounding_specificity. The comment doesn't mention a specific part of the paper, so it's weakly grounded. But it does specify what needs to be addressed, which is providing a mathematical characterization. So maybe it's weakly grounded and specific, which is 3. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAnd verifiability, since it's a claim without support, it's definitely unverifiable, so 1.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 5, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests a hypothesis about the trivial and impossible parts but doesn't provide explicit instructions on how to test it or what changes to make. It's vague on the actions the authors should take. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts like trivial parts being highly consistent with the training set and impossible parts having ambiguous labels. It clearly identifies the sections without needing further guessing. That sounds like full grounding because it's specific and pinpoints the issue. So, a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review proposes a hypothesis but doesn't back it up with evidence or references. It's just a guess without justification, so it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 because it lacks support.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is somewhat helpful by suggesting a hypothesis, but it's vague and doesn't guide the authors on how to proceed. It's not very detailed, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Maybe a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores make sense based on the review's content and how explicit, grounded, verifiable, and helpful it is.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The technical contribution is limited, i.e., there is no significant technical contribution and extension based on a typical model for the cross-domain recommendation setting.\" Hmm, the reviewer is pointing out that the technical contribution is limited. They mention that there's no significant technical contribution and that it's an extension based on a typical model. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to see if this comment gives explicit or implicit actions. The reviewer is stating a fact, but they don't suggest any specific changes or improvements. They just point out the limitation. So, it's more of a statement than an actionable suggestion. Therefore, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. It's probably borderline actionable because it does hint at a problem but doesn't specify how to fix it. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the comment is. The reviewer says the technical contribution is limited but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is lacking. They mention the cross-domain recommendation setting but don't pin it down. So, the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the referenced part. They also don't specify what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this is not grounded at all, so it's a 1 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim because it states that the technical contribution is limited. Now, is this claim verifiable? The reviewer is pointing out a limitation but doesn't provide any justification or references. They just state it as a fact. So, there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment identifies a limitation but doesn't provide any suggestions or guidance on how to improve. It's just pointing out a problem without offering solutions. So, it's not helpful at all because the authors don't know what to do next. Hence, helpfulness is 1.\n\nPutting it all together, all four aspects are scored as 1 because the review point doesn't provide actionable feedback, lacks grounding, isn't verifiable, and isn't helpful for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review point asks the authors to explain how the focal stack is synthesized, the forward model of using a defocus map and image, and how to handle edges with depth discontinuities. It's pretty explicit about what needs to be done, so that's good. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement these, like providing formulas or detailed steps. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out the implementation details themselves. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review points out specific technical aspects of the method, like the focal stack synthesis and handling depth discontinuities. It doesn't just mention a general issue but specifically targets parts of the methodology. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, so it's well-grounded. Since it's specific about the parts of the paper and what's wrong, it should be a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for its points. It just asks the authors to explain certain aspects without backing it up. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does identify areas for improvement but doesn't provide any specific suggestions or guidance on how to address those issues. It's vague and leaves the authors with a lot of questions. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the approach components aren't novel and lists some models and strategies used before. It also points out that the results are similar to another method. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what they should do to improve their work. So, it's not giving clear actions or suggestions. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd give it a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review does mention specific models and references previous works. It clearly points out what's missing and compares it to another method. So, it's well-grounded and specific. That should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review references specific papers and provides some justification for the claims made. However, the references are cited, but the reasoning is a bit vague. It mentions that the results are almost the same as another method but doesn't provide detailed explanations or more references. So, it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out weaknesses and previous work but doesn't suggest specific improvements or a clear path forward. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies issues, but it's not as detailed or actionable as it could be. So, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review points out several questions and requests for more details, like whether the OT sample selection runs once or iteratively, whether training and OT are done by turns, and asks for a flowchart and runtimes. These are all specific actions the authors can take to improve their work. The reviewer is clear about what needs to be added, so the action is explicit. Moreover, each point is quite detailed, so the authors know exactly what to do. That makes the actionability high, so I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions specific sections of the paper, like section 2.4.3 and equation (3), which are precise. They also ask for a flowchart, which is a specific part of the paper. The mention of runtimes relates to the methodology, which is a specific part. So the grounding is strong because the reviewer is pointing out exact places in the paper. The specificity is also good because they're not just saying \"improve the paper\" but are asking for detailed changes. So this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the OT process, whether it's iterative, the flow of training and OT, and the runtimes. These claims are supported by logical reasoning, like explaining that the process should be iterative, and by referencing the equations and sections mentioned. However, while the reasoning is logical, the references are a bit vague, like mentioning equations without specific citations. Also, the flowchart idea is a suggestion that could be supported by external references if provided. So while the claims are somewhat justified, there's room for more concrete evidence. I think a 3 is fair here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer is asking several specific questions and providing clear suggestions, which should help the authors improve their paper. The questions are detailed enough to guide the authors through their work, and the suggestions are actionable. However, the reviewer doesn't offer any personal opinions or evaluations of the paper's quality, which might make the feedback a bit more helpful if they had provided some context. But overall, it's quite helpful, so a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects, making sure each point is evaluated based on the given definitions and the review's content.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors discuss handling continuous tasks but don't have experiments for them. It also asks why entropy methods aren't included and compares their performance to ConBO. The explicit action here is pointing out the missing experiments and asking for comparisons. However, the instructions say that explicit actions are direct, so this seems explicit. But the action isn't very detailed\u2014like, it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do, just what's missing. So it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit and detailed. I think this would be a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Section 7 for entropy methods but doesn't specify which part of that section. It also asks about empirical performance without pointing to a specific figure or table. So the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. But it does mention a section, which is better than nothing. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that entropy methods aren't included in experiments and asks for comparisons. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so there's no supporting evidence. This seems unverifiable, so I'd give it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out missing experiments and asks for comparisons, which is helpful. It guides the authors to look in a specific section but doesn't provide data or evidence. It's clear and actionable, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most helpful. I'd rate this a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions calculating precision/recall/F1-score for a 4-class classification and suggests providing AUC results for model performance comparisons. It's explicit about the calculations and provides clear instructions on what to do. However, it doesn't specify how to implement these calculations or where to find resources or examples. So, it's somewhat actionable but lacks the concrete details needed. That would be a 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review talks about metrics for breast density classification and suggests AUC for comparisons. It doesn't reference any specific sections of the paper or provide context about why these metrics are important. It's a bit vague, so the grounding isn't very specific. That also scores a 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting providing AUC results. It doesn't back this up with any references or logical reasoning. It's just a suggestion without justification, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers specific suggestions about metrics and comparisons, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to implement these suggestions. It's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So, a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the review point's content.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the number of tasks is limited and suggests seeing several tasks (at least 10) and sequential results. It also asks for more detailed feedback. The action here is clear: authors should add more tasks and provide sequential results. The instructions are explicit, so that's good. However, the review doesn't specify exactly how to implement this, like whether they should compare with other studies or what metrics to use. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to tasks and sequential results but doesn't specify which part of the paper or unique aspects. It's a bit vague. The grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or unique element. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests improvements but doesn't provide any evidence or references. It's just a request for more tasks and results. There's no justification or supporting data, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the weaknesses and provides some suggestions, but it's vague and lacks specific details. The questions are good, but without concrete guidance, it's somewhat helpful. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that's a thorough breakdown.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the experimental setup is semi-real because it's a merge of single-node cascades. It suggests making it more real by avoiding such merges. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. But the instruction says to make the action concrete, meaning it should tell the authors exactly how to apply the change. Here, it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify which parts to modify or how to ensure the setup is more real. So I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to multi-node seed cascades and mentions merging single-node ones. It's clear which part is being discussed, so the grounding is full. It also explains what's wrong and suggests a fix, which is specific. Therefore, it should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the setup is semi-real. It's supported by the reasoning that multi-node cascades aren't standard, so it's logical and clear. There's no need for external references here, but the reasoning is solid. So it's **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and suggests a solution. It's clear and actionable, so it should be **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the results are partially derivative, extending hyper-networks from existing literature. It doesn't specify what changes the authors should make. So, it's not explicit or vague. Since it doesn't tell the authors how to improve, it's not actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions extending to hyper-networks but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what needs to be addressed. It's vague, so grounding is weak. Maybe a 3 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment claims the results are derivative but doesn't provide evidence or reasoning. It's just a statement without justification, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a lack of originality but doesn't help the authors improve. It's vague and doesn't guide them, so it's somewhat helpful but not very. Maybe a 3.\n\nSo, overall, each aspect is rated a 3 because they're all somewhat lacking in their respective areas.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the GAT is trained with the whole model and mentions that it needs to be reviewed by an English native speaker and some sentences need rewriting for clarity. I think the explicit action here is pointing out the need for a native review and rewriting. But is this action clear? It tells the authors what to do but doesn't specify how to go about it, like suggesting who to contact or how to rewrite. So, it's not fully actionable because the method isn't detailed. Maybe it's borderline because it does hint at actions but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the GAT being trained but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this refers to. It also mentions needing a native review and rewriting, which is a bit vague. There's no specific section or element of the paper addressed, so it's not fully grounded. It's more of a general suggestion without pinpointing the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the GAT needs a native review and rewriting. But there's no supporting evidence or justification for this. It's just a statement without backing, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out areas for improvement but doesn't provide concrete reasons or specific suggestions. It tells the authors what to do but not how or why. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth, making it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the given definitions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

As shown in Table 3 (a), the performance is getting worse with growth of the maximum number of identities. It means that the capacity should be preset to some small number (e.g., 10).

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review says the experiment section could be improved by doing significance tests on human evaluation results and comparing with recent LLMs. It mentions specific actions like carrying out tests and comparisons, so that's explicit. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to do the significance tests or how to compare with LLMs. It's vague on the methods. So, it's not fully actionable because the steps aren't detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does suggest actions but doesn't provide specifics. So, I'd give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions human evaluation results and recent LLMs, which are specific parts of the paper. It clearly identifies what needs improvement without guessing. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the sections being addressed. The specificity is good because it tells the authors exactly where the issues are. I'd rate this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests significance tests and comparisons. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back these suggestions. It's vague and lacks justification. So, it's unverifiable because there's no support given for why these actions are necessary or how they improve the work. I'd give it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does point out areas for improvement and suggests specific actions, which is helpful. However, it's vague on how to implement these actions and doesn't provide concrete examples or references. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies issues but doesn't fully guide the authors on how to fix them. So, I'd rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable and fully grounded, but it's unverifiable and only somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

It gives a clear direction, so that's explicit. Also, it tells them exactly what to do, which makes it concrete. So, this should be a high score, probably 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions a specific paper from ICML 2019. That's a clear reference, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where to discuss this. Also, it explains what the problem is and why their method is better, which is specific. So, this should also be a high score, likely 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points to a specific paper and explains why it's relevant. It's logical and provides a reference, which is good. However, it doesn't give examples or more details, so it's somewhat thorough but not fully verifiable. Maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out a gap and providing a reference. It gives the authors a specific task and explains why their method is better. This is very helpful and constructive, so a 5 seems right.\n\nI think all four aspects are well addressed here, so the scores should all be high.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the method has complicated modules and more parameters than baselines. It points out uncertainty about performance gains and attributes them to more parameters. It also talks about the ablation study not providing clear answers. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the review suggests looking into the ablation study, which is an action, but it's vague about how to do that. So, it's not explicit enough, making it borderline actionable. I think it should be a 1 because it's unclear.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the ablation study but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's talking about. It's general, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly what's missing. This means it's not fully grounded. I'd rate this a 3 because it's not specific enough.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the performance gain isn't clear and suggests the ablation study. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement without justification, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out issues and suggests looking into the ablation study, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or evidence, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd give it a 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a 1 except grounding_specificity and helpfulness, which are both 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says the paper only evaluates on one dataset and task. It suggests applying the analysis to more datasets and tasks. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions. Here, the comment is explicit about the suggestion, so that's good. But does it tell the authors exactly how to apply this? It says \"applied to more datasets and tasks,\" which is a bit vague. They might not know which datasets or tasks to choose. So, it's explicit but not concrete. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This is about how specific the review is in pointing out the part of the paper. The comment doesn't mention any specific part, just suggests evaluating more datasets and tasks. It's not pointing to a particular section or figure, so the grounding is weak. It's not grounded because it's too vague. So, grounding_specificity would be a 3 as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the analysis should be applied to more datasets and tasks. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a suggestion without any supporting reasoning or references. So, it's not verifiable. That would be a 1 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment does suggest evaluating more datasets and tasks, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide specific examples or further guidance. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. Therefore, helpfulness would be a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 3 except verifiability, which is 1. But wait, the initial output had actionability as 3, grounding as 3, verifiability as 1, and helpfulness as 3. That matches my evaluation.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions Figure 3 and 4 but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It talks about quantitative results not reflecting final outputs and mentions a single data sample. The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving clear instructions on how to fix it. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit comment, which means the authors still don't know exactly what to do. Therefore, it's somewhere between 3 and 4 on the actionability scale. Since it's not fully explicit, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 3 and 4 by name, which is pretty specific. It also mentions a single data sample, which is a clear point in the paper. The grounding is strong because it's pointing to specific parts without needing more context. The specificity is good because it clearly states what's missing. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the quantitative results aren't convincing. They provide some reasoning about the figures but it's a bit vague. They mention middle outputs and a single data sample, which isn't very robust. The justification isn't thorough enough, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out issues, but it's a bit vague. It doesn't suggest specific fixes or improvements. The feedback is there, but it's not as helpful as it could be. So, it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nOverall, the review has some points but lacks clarity and depth in each aspect.\n</think>\n\n**Evaluation of Review Point:**\n\n- **Actionability**: The review is implicit, leaving the authors unsure of specific actions to take. It's rated **3** for being somewhat actionable but not fully explicit.\n- **Grounding Specificity**: The review specifically references figures and a data sample, providing clear identification of the issue. It's rated **5** for strong grounding.\n- **Verifiability**: The claim is made with some reasoning but lacks thorough justification.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**:\nThe review mentions adding details to figures and supplementary information, and specifies statistical inferences needing error bars and p-values. It's explicit about the actions, so that's good. The instructions are clear, and the details provided are concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**:\nThe review refers to specific figures (Figure 2) and mentions \"sample count\" and statistical inferences. It accurately points to the relevant parts of the paper, so it's fully grounded. Additionally, it specifies what needs to be addressed, which adds specificity. Hence, this should be highly specific as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**:\nThe review provides suggestions but doesn't support them with external references or logical reasoning. It's clear about what needs to be done, but lacks justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it mentions the necessary changes, but without backing.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\nThe review is clear and provides specific suggestions, which helps the authors improve their work. However, it doesn't go into depth about why these changes are necessary or how they impact the results.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point is asking about the relevance of a framework in specific contexts like non-convex losses, non-norm type defenses, and binary classification. It's making several questions, which might be a bit vague. The author is suggesting potential issues and areas for consideration but isn't giving clear steps on what to do next. So, it's not explicitly telling the author what to change, just pointing out problems. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific areas like non-convex losses and binary classification, which means it's accurately pointing out parts of the paper. It's not just a general critique but targets specific sections. Additionally, it's asking about the framework's relevance in different contexts, which adds clarity. So, this seems well-grounded and specific. I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is posing questions but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's making claims about the framework's relevance but isn't backing them up with logical reasoning or external sources. This makes it somewhat verifiable because it's clear that the framework has issues in these areas, but without justification, it's not fully verifiable. So, I'll rate this as 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking insightful questions that could guide the author in understanding the framework's limitations. However, it's not providing direct solutions or actionable steps. It's more of a probing critique, which is helpful but not as constructive as a detailed suggestion. So, I'll rate this as 4.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on how well the review point meets the criteria for each. The review is clear in targeting specific parts of the paper but lacks explicit actions and supporting evidence, making it somewhat helpful but not fully actionable or verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is quite detailed, pointing out several specific issues like unclear techniques, unclear sparsification process, and questions about landmark extraction, feature types, and shape invariance. It seems like it's giving clear instructions on what the authors need to do. The comment is explicit about the problems and provides a list of questions, which makes it actionable. Since it's not just pointing out a problem but also guiding the authors on how to address it, I think this is highly actionable. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific areas like the sparsification process, landmark extraction, feature types, and questions about parameters and methods. It's not just vague; it's pointing to particular parts of the paper. The comment is clear about what needs to be addressed, so it's fully grounded. Also, it's specific because it details exactly what's unclear. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making claims about the lack of detail in techniques and the importance of certain processes. However, it's not providing any supporting evidence or references. It's just stating that something is unclear and asking for more details. Without any justification or examples, it's not verifiable. So, I'd rate this as 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is quite detailed and points out several specific issues, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any solutions or suggestions on how to improve the techniques. It's more about pointing out problems than offering constructive advice. While it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful because it lacks actionable solutions. So, I'd give it a 3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For grounding_specificity, the comment is fully grounded because it mentions specific sections and issues. For verifiability, since it's making claims without any justification or references, it's unverifiable. Actionability is high because it's explicit and guides the authors on what to do. Helpfulness is a 3 because it's detailed but lacks solutions.\n\nI think that's accurate.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"For the Appendix H section, it should be reorganized which is difficult to follow.\" I think the action here is suggesting reorganization, which is explicit. But the problem is, it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to reorganize it. It just says \"should be reorganized,\" which is a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know what specific changes to make. Therefore, I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment mentions \"Appendix H section\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It just says it's difficult to follow, which is a bit vague. So, the grounding isn't very specific because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's more of a general statement. Hence, I'd give it a 3 here as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that the Appendix is difficult to follow, but it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. There's no reference to external literature or logical reasoning to back it up. So, it's not verifiable. I'll rate this as 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment suggests reorganizing the Appendix but doesn't provide any specific details or examples. It's vague and doesn't give the authors a clear path forward. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not very detailed or constructive. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it does identify an issue but lacks depth.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding error bars and more random trials to Figure 1. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells the authors exactly what to do. So this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 1 but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It just says \"Figure 1\" without any further detail. So the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or element. However, it does suggest what needs to be addressed, which is a bit specific. Maybe a 3? But since it's not fully grounded, maybe a 2? Wait, the definitions say that if it's not grounded at all, it's 1. But it does mention the figure, so maybe it's weakly grounded. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe 3 because it's not fully clear but does imply the figure.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting improvements but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement that something should be added. So there's no verifiability here. It's unverifiable, so a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and actionable, which is good. It tells the authors exactly what to do, so it's somewhat helpful. It's not the most detailed, but it's better than nothing. So a 4 seems right because it's helpful but could be improved by adding more justification.\n\nWait, but for grounding_specificity, I'm still unsure. If it's not fully grounded, maybe it's 2. But the comment does mention Figure 1, which is a specific part, so maybe it's 3. I think I'll go with 3 because it's not fully clear but does point to a specific figure.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 5, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding an introduction to energy models in the Related Work section and clarifying the learning rates in Figure 1. Both of these are explicit actions the authors should take. The comment doesn't ask them to do something vague like \"improve the paper,\" it clearly states what needs to be done. So, this is explicit and gives a clear direction. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells them exactly where to add content and what specific details to include in the figure. So, it's not just a general suggestion but a specific action. Therefore, this should be a higher score. I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while it's explicit, it might be a bit vague in terms of how detailed the introduction should be or how exactly to clarify the figure. But since it's explicit and gives a clear direction, I'll go with **3**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions adding an introduction to energy models in the Related Work section. This is a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is strong. The comment doesn't just say \"improve the Related Work section,\" it pinpoints exactly where to add content. Additionally, it specifies what needs to be clarified in the figure, which adds specificity. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it clearly identifies the part of the paper and what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review points out two issues: adding background information and clarifying figure details. The suggestion to add an introduction is a claim that this addition will help the paper. Is this claim well-supported? Well, adding context can indeed strengthen the Related Work section, which is a common practice. Similarly, clarifying the figure's labels is a logical suggestion based on good academic practice. So, both points are supported by common knowledge and logical reasoning. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Verifiable** because the claims are backed by established practices and logical reasoning.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides two clear suggestions: adding background and clarifying the figure. These are actionable and directly address potential weaknesses in the paper. The suggestions are specific enough for the authors to act upon without leaving them hanging. Therefore, this should be **4: Mostly Helpful** because while it's very helpful, it might not cover all possible areas where the authors could need improvement. However, given the information, it's mostly helpful as it addresses the main points clearly.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, I think the scores should be:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 5\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using styles like dashed lines or adding color to distinguish the curves. That's a clear action the authors can take. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. Also, it's concrete because it specifies the methods to apply. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 2 and suggests specific methods to improve the distinguishability. It doesn't just say \"Figure 2 needs work\" but points out exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. So, it's fully grounded because it references the specific part of the paper and clearly states the issue and solution.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the figure is difficult to distinguish and suggests methods to improve it. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up these claims. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting data or logical reasoning provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify an issue and provides actionable suggestions, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague in explaining why distinguishing the curves is important and doesn't offer a deeper analysis. It could be more helpful if it included more context or reasoning behind the suggestion. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is highly actionable and grounded, but not verifiable and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors should tone down the introduction and not call it language learning. It suggests it's more of a feedback-driven QA dialog. This is explicit, so it's not implicit. But the action is vague\u2014how much to tone down? There's no specific guidance on what changes to make. So it's explicit but lacks detail, making it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the introduction and suggests a different approach. It doesn't specify which part of the introduction or what exactly to change. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does touch on the introduction but doesn't clearly identify the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that the tasks are mismatched and suggests a different approach. There's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's a claim without justification, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some feedback but is vague. It tells the authors what to do but doesn't provide specific details or examples. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions proving lower bounds for round complexity and says that the paper uses a reduction from collaborative ranking, leading to lower bounds. It doesn't specify what changes the authors should make. So, the action is explicit (they mention the work involved), but there's no guidance on how to apply it. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear what needs to be done, but lacks specifics on implementation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"round complexity\" and \"lower bounds,\" which are specific technical terms. It doesn't mention any part of the paper beyond that, so the grounding is weak. The comment is specific about the technical aspects but doesn't clearly identify the exact part of the paper being addressed, like a section or figure. So, it's weakly grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the lower bounds follow from collaborative ranking results. It doesn't provide any references or justification, so it's not fully verifiable. It's somewhat verifiable because it mentions the source, but without supporting evidence, it's not fully justified.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out the work involved but doesn't offer actionable suggestions. It's clear that the authors need to prove lower bounds, but there's no guidance on how to do it. So, it's somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue, but it's vague and lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the review point's content.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Each aspect has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the review says, \"5 shows evidence that some information is learned before the model is able to use the concepts.\" The key here is whether this comment provides a clear action or suggestion. It mentions that there's evidence, but it doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's vague about how to address the issue. So, it's not explicit, which would make it implicit. Since it's vague, it doesn't give the authors a clear path forward. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does explicitly state that there's an issue, but it's vague on how to fix it. So, I'll label this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment doesn't mention a specific part of the paper or any section. It's too general, just saying that there's evidence but not pointing to where or what exactly is wrong. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint the issue. The specificity is also lacking because it doesn't explain what needs to be done. Therefore, this should be \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific,\" which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment talks about \"evidence\" but doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back it up. It's just a general statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no support given. This would be a \"Somewhat Verifiable\" score, which is 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment mentions that there's evidence but doesn't specify what to do next. It's vague and doesn't offer actionable steps. While it points out a problem, it doesn't help the authors improve their work because there's no clear guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'll rate this as 3 as well.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 3 because they all fall into the middle category where the review points out an issue but doesn't provide enough detail or support for the authors to act effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

The comment mentions the limitation of the approach but does not provide explicit instructions on how to improve it. It suggests that the innovation is limited but does not specify what changes are needed or how to address the issue. Therefore, the action is not clearly defined, making it unactionable for the authors.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity**: The review point is labeled as 3 (Weakly Grounded and Specific). The comment refers to a specific part of the paper (frame-wise SDSA) and mentions a related work (ConsiStory). However, it does not clearly identify the exact section or provide a detailed explanation of the issue, which could be improved for better understanding by the authors.\n\n3. **Verifiability**: The review point is labeled as 3 (Somewhat Verifiable). The comment states that the innovation is limited and mentions a related work, but it does not provide specific references or detailed justification for why the approach is limited. This makes it somewhat verifiable but not fully supported with evidence.\n\n4. **Helpfulness**: The review point is labeled as 3 (Somewhat Helpful). The comment points out a limitation but does not provide concrete suggestions or detailed explanations on how to improve the approach.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that there are no results with larger models like ResNet101/152. It suggests that this is a limitation. Now, is this an explicit or implicit action? The comment is pointing out a problem but doesn't tell the authors what to do next. It doesn't specify adding results or suggesting why larger models aren't used. So, it's implicit. Since it's implicit, the authors still don't know how to apply this. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd give it a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about ResNet50/34/18 performing well but not larger models. It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a particular section or figure. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. But it does mention what's missing, which is specific enough. So, I think it's weakly grounded and specific, which would be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that larger models aren't used. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an observation without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a limitation but doesn't suggest any improvements. It's clear and identifies an issue, but without further guidance, the authors don't know what to do next. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 1, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"There is not much novelty in the methodology. The proposed meta algorithm is basically a direct extension of existing methods.\" It mentions that the method is an extension of existing ones but doesn't specify what changes need to be made. So, it's giving a general idea but not pointing out exact actions the authors should take. That makes it **1: Unactionable** because the authors don't know what specific steps to improve.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the methodology being an extension of existing methods but doesn't pinpoint where exactly the lack of novelty is. It doesn't reference a specific part of the paper or suggest a particular issue. So, it's not grounded because it can't clearly identify the part being addressed. Therefore, it's **1: Not Grounded**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states a fact: the method is an extension. There's no claim or suggestion, just a statement. So, it doesn't require verification because it's purely factual. That makes it **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a weakness but doesn't suggest how to improve it. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable feedback. So, it's only **2: Barely Helpful** because it does identify an issue but lacks the necessary guidance for the authors to act on it.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the performance is only compared with a few methods and that the proposed method isn't consistently better. It suggests the authors might be willing to change their rating based on feedback. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The review does state that the method isn't better, which is explicit. However, it doesn't provide specific actions or suggestions on how to improve the draft. It's more of a statement than an actionable suggestion. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it mentions an action but lacks detail on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about comparing with a few methods and the proposed method not being better. It doesn't specify which part of the paper is being addressed, like a particular section or figure. It's vague about what needs improvement. Since it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper, it's not fully grounded. Therefore, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it mentions the issue but doesn't pinpoint the exact area.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the performance isn't consistently better and suggests the authors might change their rating. There's no claim here; it's more of a statement without justification. So, it's a \"Normal Statement,\" which means no claim exists, hence labeled as \"X.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides some critique about the comparison and the proposed method. It does suggest the authors might adjust their rating, which is helpful. However, it's not very detailed or specific. It offers some guidance but isn't comprehensive. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 3 because they either provide some information but lack detail or clarity.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"D\" is used to represent both dimensionality of points and dilation factor. Better to use different notation to avoid confusion. I remember that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the comment is pointing out a specific issue with the notation, suggesting a better alternative. It's explicit about the problem and provides a clear solution, so that's good. It doesn't seem vague or unclear. So, I'd say this is highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to change and how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment again talks about \"D\" causing confusion. It doesn't mention any specific part of the paper, just the notation issue. There's no mention of a section, table, or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing where exactly the problem is. It's more of a general suggestion, which isn't as helpful for the author to know exactly what to fix.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment is a suggestion to change notation, which is a judgment or opinion. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's not verifiable. Without supporting evidence, authors can't be sure why this change is necessary or how it helps. So, this comment isn't very verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment suggests a specific change to avoid confusion, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague about why changing the notation is beneficial. The author doesn't get a clear reason for the change, which might make it less helpful. It's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Actionability: Highly actionable (5)\n- Grounding_specificity: Weakly grounded and not specific (2)\n- Verifiability: Unverifiable (1)\n- Helpfulness: Somewhat helpful (3)\n\nI think that's a fair evaluation based on the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the generator tends to collapse and suggests the proposed module won't, but it doesn't explain why. It's asking the authors to show the mechanism. So, the action is clear: explain the difference. But the explanation is vague because it doesn't provide specific details or examples. It just hints at the reason. So, this is explicit in asking for an action but vague on how to do it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out a specific section (Sec 5.3) and mentions the issue with the generator. It also asks for an explanation of the mechanism. Since it references a specific section and clearly states what's missing, it's fully grounded. It doesn't just say \"Section X\" but mentions the exact part. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the proposed module prevents collapse, but it doesn't support this with evidence or reasoning. It just states the observation without backing it up. There's no justification or references, so it's unverifiable. That would be **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest improvements by pointing out a specific issue and asking for an explanation. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete details or examples. It's helpful in identifying the problem but lacks depth. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is clear in its intent but lacks specifics in the action, grounding, verifiability, and helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the article's reasoning is similar to another study and questions if it's an extension. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not explicit or pointing out specific changes. Therefore, it's unactionable. I'll give it a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to another study but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's talking about. It's a bit vague, so the authors don't know exactly where the issue is. That means it's weakly grounded. Also, it doesn't provide specific details about what's wrong, so it's not very specific. I think a 3 here makes sense because it's somewhat grounded but not fully.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests the work might be an extension but doesn't back it up with evidence or reasoning. There's no justification or references, so it's unverifiable. A 1 seems right here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises a valid point but doesn't provide clear guidance. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'll rate it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a score based on how well the review point meets the criteria for that aspect.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions experiments and explanations regarding different queries in spatio-temporal representation. It's explicit about the missing components and suggests improvements. However, it's a bit vague on how to implement these changes. So, it's not fully actionable but still provides a clear direction. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable,\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific experiments and components like spatial, temporal, and summary queries. It's clear about what's missing and suggests improvements. This seems like it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the parts of the paper that need attention. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the missing components and suggests improvements. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable, which I'll mark as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance. It's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors don't foresee negative social impacts but the reviewer isn't sure if they should review that aspect. It suggests mentioning social impacts of automation or dual use risks. So, the reviewer is giving some actionable suggestions, but the instructions aren't very clear. They're pointing out areas where the authors could improve, but it's a bit vague. I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because the reviewer does suggest something, but it's not very detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about increased automation and dual use risks. They're referring to specific aspects of the work, like social impacts and dual use. So, the reviewer is clearly pinpointing parts of the paper, which means they're grounded. They're not just making general comments but specifically addressing potential issues. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the work has potential negative social impacts. They're suggesting specific examples like automation and dual use, which are verifiable points. They're providing examples and logical reasoning, so this is **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a potential area of concern (social impact) and providing specific suggestions. While it's helpful, it's not addressing all possible areas the authors might care about. It's somewhat incomplete but still gives the authors something to consider. So, this is **Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that's a solid breakdown. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and I considered whether the suggestions are clear, specific, justified, and helpful to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review suggests moving part of Section 4 into Section 3. It's pretty explicit about the action, so that's good. The comment tells the authors exactly what to do, which makes it actionable. Now, is it explicit or implicit? It says \"maybe putting the first paragraph of sec 4 in sec 3...\" That's explicit because it clearly states the action without ambiguity. Next, is it concrete? It tells them exactly where to move the paragraph, so they know exactly how to apply it. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nMoving on to grounding_specificity. The review mentions Sections 3 and 4 but doesn't specify which part of those sections. It just says they're slightly redundant. So, the authors can't pinpoint exactly which part needs adjustment. That means the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the referenced part. Since it's not fully grounded, I don't think it can get a 5 here. Maybe a 3 or 4? But since it's not fully identifying the section, I'll go with 3.\n\nNext is verifiability. The comment is a suggestion to move content, which is a claim. But there's no justification or reasoning provided. It just says \"maybe putting the first paragraph of sec 4 in sec 3...\" without explaining why this is helpful or how it improves the paper. So, there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest a specific change, which is helpful. It gives the authors a clear direction on how to improve their paper. However, it's somewhat vague because it doesn't explain the benefits of moving the content or how this change will enhance the paper. While it's helpful, it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback. So, a 4 seems appropriate because it's mostly helpful but could be improved with more explanation.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the methods' applicability is limited because of strong assumptions about camera parameters. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They know the methods have limitations but aren't guided on how to improve them. So, it's not actionable because there's no clear step or suggestion. I'd rate this as 1, which is unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about camera parameters (extrinsics and intrinsics) and object segmentation. It's specific about what's assumed, so the authors can pinpoint where the issues lie. However, it doesn't explain why these assumptions are problematic or how to address them. It's specific in pointing out the parts but not in providing solutions. So, I think this is weakly grounded and specific, which would be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the methods are limited due to assumptions. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. There's no logical reasoning or examples, so it's not verifiable. I'd give this a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out limitations but doesn't offer concrete suggestions on how to improve the methods. It's clear and identifies an issue, but without actionable steps, it's somewhat helpful. So, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, considering how explicit, specific, verifiable, and helpful the review point is.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says, \"L006, as later written in the main text, 'thousands' is not accurate here. Maybe add 'on the subword level'?\" I need to check if this is explicit or implicit. The comment directly points out an inaccuracy and suggests a specific change, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It tells the author exactly where to add something, so yes, it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment references \"L006\" and suggests adding something specific. It doesn't just say \"fix this,\" but rather points to a specific part of the text and what to add. So, it's grounded because it mentions the exact location and what to do. It's also specific about the change needed. So, this should be a 5 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that \"thousands\" isn't accurate and suggests a fix. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why \"thousands\" is wrong or why adding \"on the subword level\" is necessary. It's just a suggestion without backing, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does identify an issue and provides a suggestion, which is helpful. However, it's quite brief and doesn't elaborate on why \"thousands\" is incorrect or how adding \"on the subword level\" will fix it. So, while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed. I'd rate this a 4 because it's somewhat helpful but could be improved with more explanation.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions several issues but doesn't provide explicit instructions on how to fix them. It talks about missing hyperparameters and questions about the figures but doesn't specify how to address these. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. I think this should be a 1 for unactionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review does point out specific areas like the latent path figures (Fig 3) and questions about normalization. It's clear which part of the paper is being discussed, so that's good grounding. It also asks for further analysis, which is specific. I'd give this a 5 because it's well-grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes some claims about the model's behavior but doesn't provide evidence or references. It's vague about why the y-value is zero at x=0 and whether it's normalized. Without supporting data or citations, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is somewhat helpful because it points out specific issues and areas for improvement. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't offer detailed suggestions. So, a 4 seems appropriate as it's mostly helpful but could be more comprehensive.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the form of 'p' should be described near line 135 but doesn't specify what to do. It implies that 'p' is a Gaussian distribution but doesn't provide concrete instructions on how to implement this. Since the action is explicit (describing 'p') but lacks detail on how to do it, this falls under **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment doesn't explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is weak. It also doesn't provide clear details on what needs to be addressed, making it **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment includes a claim that 'p' is a Gaussian distribution but doesn't support this with evidence or references. It's vague, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some suggestion but is vague and doesn't provide concrete details. It's helpful but not very detailed, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated as 3 because they either lack explicit instructions, weak grounding, vague justification, or are somewhat helpful without being fully comprehensive.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using expected performance under observation noise for evaluation because the decision-maker is interested in the true objective function, not the noise. It recommends making this distinction clearer upfront. \n\nIs this an explicit action? Yes, it tells the authors exactly what to do: make the distinction clear. But is it concrete? It gives a clear direction but doesn't specify how to implement it. So, it's explicit but not very detailed on the steps. I think this would be a **4** for actionability because it's clear but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the decision-maker caring about the true objective function and not the noise. It references the formulation in the paper and suggests making the distinction upfront. \n\nIs this well-grounded? It mentions the decision-maker's interest in the true function and the noise being misleading. It doesn't explicitly name a specific part of the paper, so it's a bit vague. But it does clearly imply where the issue lies. I'd rate this as **4** because it's grounded but not entirely specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that expected performance under observation noise is used and mentions that the decision-maker cares about the stochastic noisy function. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support why this is a good approach. It's more of a statement than a claim, so I think it's **X** because there's no claim or justification provided.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides a clear suggestion for the authors to make their distinction upfront. It's actionable and directly addresses a potential improvement. While it doesn't go into detail on how to implement it, it's still helpful. I'd rate this as **4** because it's clear and actionable, though not entirely detailed.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, each aspect is either clear and actionable or grounded and helpful, but lacks some details that would make them perfect. Therefore, I'll assign a 4 to each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the method's performance is good in Table 2 but points out that the novelty and contribution are somewhat incremental. It suggests a new network design inspired by prior work for sound source localization. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the suggestions are explicit and concrete. The review does give a direction for improvement by suggesting a new design, which is explicit. However, it doesn't specify exactly what changes to make or how to implement the new network design. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out the specifics. That would make it **1: Unactionable** since it lacks the necessary details.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the method's performance and the contribution being incremental. It mentions drawing inspiration from prior work. Now, grounding specificity is about how specific the review is about the paper. The review does mention the task (sound source localization) but doesn't tie it directly to a specific part of the paper, like a section or figure. It's a bit vague in pinpointing exactly where the issue lies. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not entirely clear but does provide some specific elements.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the contribution being somewhat incremental and suggests a new network design. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. The claim is made without justification, so it's not verifiable. That would be **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing to support the suggestions.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out areas for improvement but doesn't provide detailed actionable steps. It mentions the new design but doesn't explain how to implement it or what changes are needed. This makes the feedback somewhat helpful but not fully constructive.

It also inquires about whether this phenomenon is commonly encountered and if the author observed it. These are clear actions or suggestions for the author to provide evidence or clarify their findings. However, the instructions for actionability mention that explicit actions are those that are direct or apparent, while implicit actions require the author to infer. In this case, the review point is asking for specific information, which is a direct action. However, the action is vague because it doesn't specify how to demonstrate the collapse or what data to present. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement the action.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   The review point refers to \"your model collapsing less than other methods\" and mentions \"gradients become 0 and collapse.\" It does not explicitly name a specific section, table, or figure of the paper.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"This method seems to only work for generative models that can be fine-tuned as an in/outpainting model.\" The action here is pointing out that the method is limited to a specific type of model. However, it doesn't give any explicit instructions on how to improve the draft beyond this limitation. So, it's not giving clear steps or modifications the authors should make. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at a limitation but doesn't specify how to address it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"generative models that can be fine-tuned as an in/outpainting model.\" It doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper this refers to. The authors might not know exactly where this limitation applies, so the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it's not pointing to a specific section or issue in the paper.\n\nFor verifiability, the review states a fact about the method's applicability. It doesn't provide any justification or references to back this claim. Without supporting evidence, it's hard to verify the claim's validity. So, it's unverifiable because there's no reasoning or references provided to substantiate the statement.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a limitation but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors in enhancing their work. Therefore, it's not helpful at all because it lacks actionable feedback or depth.\n\nSo, each aspect scores a 1 because they either lack explicitness, grounding, justification, or helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests moving some experimental details back into the main text and moving some background from Section 2 to the appendix. That sounds like a clear action. The reviewer is pointing out exactly what needs to be done, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't just say to move things; they specify where to move them. They mention the appendix and Section 2, which gives a clear idea of where to make these changes. So, this is both explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5 because it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions moving details to the appendix and background to Section 2. They're pinning down exactly where these parts are in the paper. That's full grounding because they're accurately pointing to specific sections. Also, they're being specific about what needs to be moved. So, this should also be a 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that moving details will make the interpretation hard. They're suggesting a change, which is a claim. Now, is this claim supported? Well, moving details to the appendix is a common practice, so it's a logical reasoning point. They're basing their suggestion on standard academic practices, which makes it verifiable. So, this should be a 4 because it's mostly verifiable with some logical reasoning but maybe not the most robust support.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is providing clear suggestions on where to move parts of the paper. They're being specific about moving to the appendix and Section 2. This gives the authors clear directions on how to improve their draft. It's actionable and constructive, so it's highly helpful. I think this should be a 5 because it's thorough and constructive.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, maybe it's a bit more. The reviewer is suggesting a change based on their judgment, but is that claim fully verifiable? They're relying on common knowledge that moving details to the appendix is standard, so that's logical reasoning. Maybe it's a 4 because while it's mostly verifiable, it could be more robust with specific references or examples. But I think the main point is covered, so 4 is okay.\n\nOverall, each aspect seems to be at least a 4, but since actionability and grounding are fully explicit and specific, they get 5s. Verifiability is mostly supported by logical reasoning, so 4. Helpfulness is highly constructive, so 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking for clarification on what \"active vertices\" mean. It's not giving a direct instruction on what to do, like suggesting a change or a specific fix. So, it's more of a question, which means the action is implicit. Since the authors still don't know exactly how to proceed, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable,\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review is asking for a definition of \"active vertices.\" It's not pointing to a specific part of the paper or giving a clear example. It's a general question, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't specify what exactly is needed, so it's not fully grounded. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is asking for a definition, which is a claim. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's just a question without any backing, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for clarification, which is helpful but not very detailed. It doesn't provide specific suggestions or examples, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not the most helpful. I'd give this a 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect gets a 3 except verifiability, which is 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Technically, there is no enough new stuffs here.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n**Actionability (1-5):**\n\nThe review comment states that the proposed method is a combination of GCN and normalizing flow, describes some technical aspects, and ends with a statement that there's \"no enough new stuffs here.\" \n\n- **Explicitness:** The comment explicitly states the method's composition and mentions the absence of new technical elements. This is explicit.\n- **Concreteness:** The comment describes the method's components and the technical limitation but does not provide specific steps or guidance on how to improve the method. It is vague on how to apply the feedback.\n\n**Conclusion:** The comment is explicit but vague, making it somewhat actionable. However, since it doesn't provide concrete steps for improvement, it's borderline actionable.\n\n**Grounding Specificity (1-5):**\n\nThe comment refers to the \"proposed method\" and mentions \"GCN and normalizing flow.\" It does not explicitly identify a specific part of the paper, such as a section, table, or figure. The reference is general, making it weakly grounded. However, it does specify that there's a lack of new technical stuff, which adds specificity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The comment is weakly grounded but provides specific information about the method's composition and a deficiency, making it somewhat grounded and specific.\n\n**Verifiability (1-5):**\n\nThe comment contains a claim that the method lacks new technical elements. However, there is no supporting evidence or justification for this claim. It is vague and lacks references or logical reasoning to back it up.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is made without any justification, making it unverifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness (1-5):**\n\nThe comment identifies a technical limitation but does not provide actionable suggestions or guidance on how to address this issue.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that only the projection head (CNN layers) are affected but not the classification head (FCN layer). It doesn't specify what needs to be done or how to fix it. So, the action isn't clear. It's more of a statement than a directive. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the projection head and classification head but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section it's referring to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is, so it's not grounded. I'll give this a 1 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why only the projection head is affected. There's no logical reasoning or references to support the claim. It's just a statement without backing, so it's not verifiable. Another 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a difference between the projection and classification heads but doesn't offer any suggestions or explanations on how to address this. It's not helpful because the authors don't know what steps to take. So, this is also a 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the analogy between HOI and Harmonic analysis is interesting but weak. It also points out that the decomposition/integration steps don't connect closely with Fourier analysis as claimed. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the reviewer is giving clear instructions on what the authors should do. The reviewer does suggest that the link is weak and that the steps don't connect closely, which is an explicit action. However, they don't tell the authors exactly how to improve their work. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about the analogy and the basis in HOI analysis, which seems specific. They also mention the decomposition steps and their connection to Fourier analysis. This part is pretty specific because they're pointing out specific parts of the paper and what's missing. So, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the link is weak and that the steps don't connect closely. They back up the first part with an opinion but don't provide evidence or references. The second part about the decomposition steps not connecting closely is also an opinion without justification. So, this is **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but it's not robust.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer does point out weaknesses and suggests areas for improvement, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are vague and don't provide concrete steps. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That makes it a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. The review is clear about the issues but doesn't give detailed guidance, so it's borderline in terms of actionability and verifiability. It's specific about the parts of the paper but doesn't back up its claims well. Overall, it's somewhat helpful because it identifies problems, but it could be more detailed to be fully helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that Figure 8 shows images with 1m and 5m focusing distances, which are in the training data. It then asks about other focusing distances and whether the model generalizes well. The action here is clear: the authors need to consider other distances and assess generalization. But the instruction is quite vague. It doesn't specify how to check generalization or what steps to take. So, it's explicit in asking for something but lacks detail on how to implement it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to Figure 8 by name and mentions specific distances (1m and 5m) that are in the training data. It also asks about other distances, which are part of the paper's content. The comment is specific about the figure and the distances, so it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the model generalizes well beyond the training data. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or justification for this claim. There's no reference to external studies or logical reasoning to support the generalization claim. So, it's **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a potential issue with the model's generalization but doesn't offer a solution or suggest how to address it. It's clear and identifies a problem, but without actionable steps, it's only somewhat helpful. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that Eq. 12 is confusing and asks where the reward comes from. It also suggests explaining the network model with equations. The action here is clear: the reviewer is pointing out a confusion and providing a solution. The solution is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. Additionally, the instructions are concrete because they specify exactly what needs to be done, like explaining the model with equations. So, this is highly actionable because it's both explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions Eq. 12 and the network model in Sec. 4.2. They don't explicitly name the section or page, but it's clear from the context. So, the grounding is full because it can be inferred accurately. The specificity is also good because they explain what needs to be addressed, which is the network model. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that the network model should be explained with equations. The justification is that it would improve clarity, which is a logical reasoning. However, there's no external reference or specific example provided. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth. So, I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but not fully supported.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides a clear point about the confusion in Eq. 12 and a constructive suggestion to improve clarity by explaining the model with equations. This is very helpful because it directly addresses a potential issue and offers a solution. It's comprehensive and actionable, so I'd give this a 5.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, I'm not sure if it's 3 or 4. The claim is that explaining the model with equations would improve clarity, which is a logical suggestion, but without specific references or examples, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe it's borderline, so perhaps 3 is correct. Alternatively, if the reasoning is clear enough, maybe 4. But I think 3 is safer because it's somewhat justified but lacks key elements.\n\nSo, final scores: actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

The comment says, \"3 Minor Issues: Ln 32 on Page 1, \u2018Empiically\u2019 should be \u2018Empirically\u2019.\" It explicitly states an action: pointing out a typo.

So maybe a 5? Wait, no, because it's not very detailed. Hmm, maybe 4? I'm a bit confused here.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment points out an issue on a specific line, so it's grounded. It also clearly states what's wrong, so it's specific. That should be a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is just a correction, not a claim. So it doesn't require verification. It's more of a factual statement, so it's X.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a minor typo, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, so it's mostly helpful. Maybe a 4.\n\nWait, but for actionability, I'm not sure if it's 4 or 5. The comment is explicit but doesn't provide the correction. Maybe it's 4 because it's clear but not very detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the number of entities is fixed and it's unclear how to generalize a model to different numbers. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next, like suggesting a method or providing an example. So, it's not giving a clear action. That makes it somewhat actionable because it points out an issue, but without a direct solution, it's probably a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the number of entities and the need to generalize a model. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or figure it's referring to, like mentioning a specific figure or section. So, it's not fully grounded. It's a bit vague, so I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states a problem but doesn't provide any justification or references. It just says it's unclear how to generalize. There's no supporting evidence or logical reasoning, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out an issue but doesn't offer any suggestions or solutions. It's just pointing out a problem without helping the authors improve. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated a 3 because they either lack explicitness, grounding, justification, or helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the novelty isn't enough and mentions both the new metric and method are straightforward. It doesn't specify what needs to be done, like suggesting changes or improvements. So, it's explicit in pointing out issues but doesn't give clear actions. That makes it somewhat actionable because it tells them there's a problem, but not how to fix it. So, I think it's a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the novelty and the straightforwardness of the metric and method. It doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper or method. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. It's also not very specific about what needs fixing. So, this should be a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions the limitations and straightforwardness but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating facts without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing for the claims made. That would be a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does point out issues but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or guidance on how to improve. It's clear that there's a problem but lacks detailed advice. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that identifying rationales is hard for NLP tasks, specifically machine translation. It also points out that the paper is well-organized but suggests improvements like making Figure 2 less cluttered and adjusting the font size for bold text. The actions here are clear: suggest a solution for Figure 2 and recommend a font change. The reviewer provides specific suggestions, so the actions are explicit. The details are concrete, like suggesting a different color or bigger font. So, this should be highly actionable. But wait, the initial thought was 3, but maybe it's 5 because the actions are explicit and the details are concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 2 by name and mentions specific issues like clutter and text visibility. It doesn't make any general comments or guess where the problem is, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is high because it clearly states what needs improvement in Figure 2.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer provides specific suggestions without relying on external references. They suggest a different color and font size, which are logical and common-sense solutions. There's no claim made, just descriptive suggestions, so it's a normal statement. Therefore, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or evidence provided beyond the suggestions themselves.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear feedback on a specific issue, suggesting practical changes. It's not vague; it provides actionable items. While it could be expanded, the current points are sufficient for improvement. So, it's mostly helpful but not fully comprehensive, hence a 4.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, grounding_specificity was 3, but since the review clearly refers to Figure 2 and explains the issues, it should be 5. Maybe I made a mistake there. Also, for verifiability, since there are no claims, it's a normal statement, so it's not verifiable, which would be a 3. But the initial output had grounding_specificity as 3, which I think was incorrect. I need to correct that.\n\nSo, after re-evaluating, the correct labels should be:\n\n- actionability: 5\n- grounding_specificity: 5\n- verifiability: 3\n- helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point asks about the intuition behind the choice of \u03bb_t and mentions whether \u03b5 is included. It also questions why the sum of N(s,a) is used instead of just N(s,a). These are specific questions, so the author gets clear instructions on what to explain. However, the questions are somewhat vague. For example, asking about the intuition is good, but not specifying how detailed the explanation should be makes it a bit vague. So, I think this is a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points directly address specific parts of the algorithm, like \u03bb_t and the sum in Equation (7). It mentions specific variables (\u03bb_t, \u03b5, N(s,a)), which means the author can pinpoint exactly where to look. This shows strong grounding because it's not just a general critique but targets specific elements of the method. So, I'll give this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or references. It just asks questions without explaining why they're important or citing any sources. Without supporting evidence, the claims are unverifiable. So, this should be an X for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and specific, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer concrete suggestions or explanations beyond asking questions. It's somewhat detailed but lacks the constructive feedback that would guide the author on how to improve. So, a 4 seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It also asks why not assume the first column is zero. This is explicit, so it's clear what the author should do. The action is concrete because it tells the author exactly where to add the comment and what to explain. So, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to equations (2) and mentions dropping the no-op action. It doesn't explicitly name the section or equation but does point out a specific part of the paper. It also clearly explains what's wrong, so it's grounded. Since it accurately points to the issue without needing more context, it's fully grounded and specific, so another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that dropping the no-op action is valid and suggests an alternative approach. It doesn't provide external references or detailed reasoning, so it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe a 3 because it's clear but lacks depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific issue and suggests an improvement. It's clear and actionable, so it's mostly helpful.

It also connects this to a paper [15] about perturbed gradient descent. The reviewer is pointing out a specific result and its implications. However, the reviewer doesn't explicitly tell the author what to do next or how to improve the algorithm based on this observation. They just state the findings. So, while the reviewer provides some information, it's not clear what action the author should take. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it's implicit but not detailed enough.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer references a specific paper [15] and points out a particular result about perturbed gradient descent. They also connect it to the current work's Theorem 3. This means the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the relevant sections and results, which shows strong grounding. Additionally, the reviewer explains how the findings relate to the current work, making the grounding explicit and clear. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer references a specific paper and explains the implications of the result. While the reference is cited, the explanation is a bit vague about how exactly the findings impact the current work. There's some justification but not a lot of depth or specific examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's some support, but it's not fully robust or detailed.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides some relevant information but doesn't offer concrete suggestions on how to improve the algorithm or what changes are needed. They mention the implications but don't guide the author on specific steps or fixes. This makes the review somewhat helpful but not entirely comprehensive. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is clear and well-referenced but lacks explicit guidance and depth in its suggestions. It's helpful but not the most helpful possible.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment says, \"Keypoint detection results should be included in the experiments section.\" I remember that actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment is explicit because it tells the author exactly where to put the keypoint detection results. It doesn't ask for clarification or anything else, so it's not implicit. Also, it's concrete because it tells the author exactly where to include it. So, this should be a high score. I think a 5 is appropriate here because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment again says, \"Keypoint detection results should be included in the experiments section.\" Grounding refers to how specific the comment is about which part of the paper it's addressing. The comment mentions the experiments section, which is specific. It doesn't just say \"the paper\" but points to a particular section. So, the grounding is strong. It's fully grounded because it clearly identifies the section. Specificity is about how clear the comment is about what needs to be fixed. The comment tells the author exactly where to put the results, which is specific. So, this should also be a 5. \n\nMoving on to **verifiability**. The comment is a directive: \"Include the keypoint detection results in the experiments section.\" There's no claim here; it's just a request. Since there's no claim, it doesn't need to be verifiable. So, according to the guidelines, this should be marked as \"X\" because there's no claim to verify.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment is clear and tells the author exactly where to put the results. It's actionable and provides a specific instruction. While it doesn't go into why including these results is beneficial, it's still helpful because it gives a direct improvement. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I think a 4 is appropriate here because it's helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be actionability: 5, grounding_specificity: 5, verifiability: X, and helpfulness: 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing the proposed model with existing ones like Revisiting Visual Question Answering Baselines. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it doesn't specify how to implement this comparison, like whether it's a direct comparison or what metrics to use. So it's not fully actionable because the method isn't detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific existing model, which is a strong point. It clearly identifies which part of the paper it's referring to, so that's fully grounded. Also, it specifies what needs to be done, which is a good level of specificity. So this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting a comparison. It references a specific paper, which is external evidence. The reasoning is clear, and the reference is specific, so this is thoroughly supported. That makes it fully verifiable, so a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific area for improvement and provides a clear suggestion to compare with existing models. It's actionable and gives a direction for the authors. While it could be expanded, it's already quite helpful. So I'd rate this a 4.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, making sure to follow the criteria for each category.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding translations to Figure 6 for non-Chinese speakers. This is a clear action, so it's explicit. The comment also provides guidance on how to implement it by mentioning adding translations. Therefore, it's concrete. So, this should be a higher score, maybe 4 or 5. But since it's explicit and concrete, I'll go with 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figure 6 specifically, which is a clear reference. It also suggests adding translations, which is a specific part of the paper. The grounding is strong because it accurately points to the figure. Specificity is also good because it clearly states what needs to be done. So, this should be a high score, probably 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that adding translations would help non-Chinese speakers. It doesn't provide evidence or references, so it's not fully verifiable. However, it's a clear claim, so it's somewhat verifiable. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a specific suggestion and is clear about the improvement. It's actionable and provides a clear benefit to the authors. This makes it highly helpful, so I'll score it a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability:4, grounding_specificity:5, verifiability:3, helpfulness:4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, I remember that it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment here says that the '+' sign should be a '-', and there are some changes to the definition of B and the equation for \u03bd. It also mentions minor comments. I think the author is pointing out specific changes, so that's explicit. But are the actions clear? The comment tells the author what to change but doesn't specify how. For example, it says to replace '+' with '-', but doesn't explain why or how that affects the equation. So, it's explicit about the action but vague on the details. That would make it **Borderline Actionable** since it's explicit but not fully concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. This is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper's part. The comment talks about specific lines and equations, so it does mention particular sections. It doesn't make general comments or imply where to change something without naming it. So, the author can pinpoint exactly where the changes are needed. That means it's **Fully Grounded** because it clearly references specific parts of the paper.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making claims about what should be in the equations. It suggests changes to the signs and the formula for \u03bd. But does it provide any justification for these changes? It just states what should be done without explaining why or citing any references. So, the claims are there, but there's no supporting evidence. That would be **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification, but it's not robust or detailed.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does identify specific issues and provides clear suggestions for changes. It's not vague; it tells the author exactly what needs to be altered. The minor comments are also helpful, even if they're not as detailed. So, the feedback is meaningful and actionable, making it **Highly Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the authors didn't compare any models other than GPT2, which is an explicit action. However, it doesn't specify how to improve the comparison or what changes are needed. It also points out missing citations and unreferenced notation, which are implicit actions but not detailed. So, it's not fully actionable because some parts are vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review does mention specific sections like Line 99 and Line 165, which is good. It also talks about missing citations and notation, which are specific parts of the paper. The comment implies these issues without needing more details, so it's well-grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests improvements but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It mentions missing citations and unreferenced notation but doesn't cite any external sources or explain why these are problematic. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does point out specific issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it's vague about how to fix them and doesn't provide clear guidance. It's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n\nSo, based on these evaluations, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: 3 (Somewhat Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the online learning formulation overlooks practical considerations and suggests comparing it against online learning approaches and RL. It also asks specific questions about retraining costs and comparisons. This seems like a clear action because the authors are being asked to make specific comparisons and consider retraining costs. The questions are direct, so I think this is highly actionable. I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions comparing against online learning approaches and RL, which are specific areas in the paper. It also asks about retraining costs, which is a specific element. The grounding is strong because it's pointing to particular sections or aspects of the paper. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides suggestions and asks questions but doesn't back them up with references or logical reasoning. It's clear that the authors need to make these comparisons and consider retraining costs, but there's no evidence to support why online learning is being compared or how retraining costs affect the model. This makes it somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out specific issues and asking clear questions, which is very helpful. It guides the authors to improve their evaluation by considering additional factors. While it doesn't provide every possible detail, it's comprehensive enough to be highly helpful. So, a 5 here makes sense.\n\nOverall, the review is quite thorough in pointing out areas for improvement and guiding the authors, even though it doesn't provide all the necessary justifications for every point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that important references are missing and suggests a comparison. It gives specific references, which is good. But the suggestion is a bit vague\u2014just saying \"I encourage\" isn't very explicit. The authors might not know exactly how to perform the comparison. So, it's not fully actionable because the action isn't clearly defined.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment points out that GFF and EfficientFCN aim to implement fast semantic segmentation methods in an encode-decoder architecture. It also mentions the societal impact on the last page. This seems pretty specific because it references specific works and mentions a particular section of the paper. So, grounding_specificity should be high, maybe a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding references and doing a comparison. It doesn't provide any justification or examples, just mentions the references. So, it's not fully verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. Maybe a 3 since it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does suggest adding references and a comparison, which is helpful. It gives a clear direction, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly helpful with room for improvement.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores should be actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing with two specific models, but it doesn't tell the authors exactly what changes they should make. It's more of a recommendation without clear instructions. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know how to apply this comparison. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it hints at an action but doesn't specify how to do it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific models, which is good because it clearly identifies the part of the paper being referred to. However, it doesn't explain what's wrong with these models or how they relate to the authors' work. So, while it's grounded in specific references, it's not very specific about the issues. I'd rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it does pinpoint the models but doesn't elaborate on the problems.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review cites two external works but doesn't provide any justification or reasoning for why these models are relevant or how they apply to the current work. It just lists them without supporting evidence. This makes it hard for the authors to verify the claim, so it's \"Unverifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest comparing with other models, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or explanations. It's somewhat useful but lacks depth, so I'd rate it as \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nOverall, the review is somewhat helpful but could be more specific and detailed to be fully actionable and verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that Algorithm 1 uses a Vandermonde matrix, which is ill-conditioned and numerically unstable, especially for large n and small \u03b1. It also suggests that the algorithm might fail in practice and asks for experimental results. The comment is explicit about the issue and provides a clear action\u2014suggesting experiments. However, it doesn't specify how to implement these experiments, like what kind of experiments or where to find data. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out a specific issue with Algorithm 1 and mentions the Vandermonde matrix. It doesn't explicitly name the section or figure but refers to the algorithm's properties. It does clearly identify what's wrong, so it's grounded. Also, it specifies the problem with the algorithm, making it specific. Therefore, it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the Vandermonde matrix is ill-conditioned and suggests experiments. The ill-conditioning is a known fact, so it's justified by common knowledge. There's no external reference, but the reasoning is solid. So, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises a valid concern about the algorithm's practical performance and provides a clear suggestion to include experiments. It's actionable and gives the authors a direction to improve their work. While it could be more detailed, it's still helpful. So, it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Each point is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring that each score reflects the clarity, specificity, justification, and overall value to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests extending the approach to more general settings. It's explicit about the action, which is good. But it's vague because it doesn't provide specific steps or how to implement the extension. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about extending the approach but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this refers to. It's too vague, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the referenced part, making it not fully grounded.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why extending the approach would be beneficial. It's just a suggestion without supporting reasoning or references.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the authors need to clarify why there are negative numbers in Figure 1 and the implications of Figures 2 and 3. It gives specific actions like clarifying the negative numbers and discussing the implications. That seems explicit. Now, are these actions concrete? The review tells the authors exactly what to do, which is to clarify and discuss. So, it's not just vague; it's specific. Therefore, this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while the actions are explicit, maybe they could be more detailed on how to clarify or discuss the figures.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific figures by name (Figure 1, 2, 3) and mentions specific issues like negative numbers and implications. This means the authors can pinpoint exactly where the problems are. It's not just a general statement; it's specific about the parts of the paper. So, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's clear which parts are being addressed, but maybe it could be more about why the figures are problematic or how to interpret them.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the authors need to clarify certain aspects of their figures. It's not a claim that requires external references or logical reasoning. It's more of a directive. So, since there's no supporting evidence or justification provided, it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it's making a judgment but lacks the necessary backing.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions on what the authors need to do, which is helpful. It's not vague; it's specific about the figures and the issues they need to address. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Helpful** because while it's helpful, it could be more comprehensive in explaining why the figures are problematic or how the authors should analyze them.\n\nWait, but for helpfulness, maybe it's a bit more than \"Somewhat Helpful.\" It does give specific actions, so maybe it's on the higher end.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the PSA method requires more computation than baselines and explains how it's done in Algorithm 1. It also suggests comparing computation complexity in the experiment part. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement the comparison, so it's a bit vague. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Algorithm 1 and explains the computation process. It doesn't mention specific sections or tables, but it's clear which part it's talking about. So, I think this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to the relevant part and explains what's wrong.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests comparing computation complexity but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's vague and lacks justification, so it should be **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out an issue and suggests an experiment, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That would be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests adding two factors, noise and an exponential moving average, and asks about their individual contributions. It's explicit about the actions needed, like analyzing each factor's contribution and comparing with the Pi model. That's clear, so it's not implicit. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement this, like suggesting specific methods or tools. So, it's somewhat actionable because the actions are clear, but vague on the details. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions noise and exponential moving average but doesn't tie these directly to the paper's sections or specific parts. It's a bit vague about where these factors are discussed. So, the grounding isn't very specific. It's not weak because it does address parts of the paper, but it's not fully pinpointing them either. I think a 3 here makes sense.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting the need to analyze individual factors and compare with the Pi model. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's not well-verified. It's more of a suggestion without justification, so I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out areas for improvement and asking for specific analyses. It guides the authors to look into individual factors and compare models, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into depth about how to perform these analyses or provide examples, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. I'll give it a 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is clear but lacks some depth or specific details, so a 3 seems appropriate for all.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions specific issues like larger fonts for certain figures and suggests a \"CTRL\" long form explanation. It also points out a table could better emphasize data. These are all explicit actions the authors can take. The suggestions are clear and direct, so I think this is highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific parts of the paper, like figures and a table, and mentions particular elements like font sizes and text details. It doesn't just say \"the figures are unclear\" but specifies which parts. This shows a good understanding of where the issues are, so it's fully grounded. Also, it clearly states what needs fixing, making it specific. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides some reasoning but lacks specific references or examples. It suggests larger fonts and a table, but doesn't cite any external sources or explain why these changes are beneficial beyond general statements. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review offers clear feedback on specific issues and provides actionable suggestions. It doesn't just point out problems but also offers solutions, which is helpful. However, it could be more detailed, like mentioning the impact of font size on readability or how a table would present data better. Despite that, it's mostly helpful, so I'll give it a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says, \"I can't understand the meaning of the sentence... please rewrite it.\" The author is asking for clarification. Now, actionability is about whether the comment gives clear instructions. In this case, the comment is asking the author to rewrite a sentence but doesn't specify how or what exactly to do. It's more of a request for help rather than a clear action. So, it's not fully actionable because the author still needs to figure out what to do. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does state an action (rewriting), but it's vague on how to do it. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment is about not understanding a specific sentence. The author is pointing out a part of the paper (P.5, p.3, l.), which is pretty specific. The comment clearly identifies the section being addressed, so that's good. However, the comment is just a request for clarification, not an opinion or judgment. It doesn't specify what's wrong with the sentence, so it's not very specific in terms of addressing the issue. I think this is \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because the author can pinpoint the section, but the comment doesn't elaborate on what needs fixing. So, a 3 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a request for clarification, which doesn't contain a claim. It's just asking for an explanation, so it doesn't require any evidence or justification. Therefore, it's a \"No Claim\" situation, which I'll mark as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is asking for a rewrite but doesn't provide any specific suggestions or context. It's more of a request than constructive feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. I think a 3 is appropriate here because the author gets a prompt to clarify, but it's not very detailed or helpful in guiding them effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out that the authors might be confusing their method with traditional active learning. It suggests clarifying whether the method is the same. This is explicit, so it's clear what the author should do. Also, it gives a direct action, which is good. The comment is specific about the method, so it's not vague. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the \"active learning pipeline\" method and asks if it's the same as traditional active learning. It's clear which part is being referred to because it's a specific method name. The comment also explains what needs to be addressed, which is whether the method is the same. This is fully grounded and specific, so it gets a 5 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests checking if the method is the same by asking if they selected informative samples. This is a claim, and it's supported by logical reasoning. It doesn't require external references, but the reasoning is clear. However, it's somewhat vague because it doesn't provide specific examples or references. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential confusion in the methodology, which is helpful for the authors to understand if their approach is novel or similar to existing methods. It's clear and actionable, providing a specific suggestion. While it's not the most detailed, it's still very helpful. So, this should be a 4.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the comparison is unfair because the baselines lack prior knowledge or language embeddings. It suggests a better comparison should be considered. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a specific action. They're suggesting a better comparison, which is a form of action, but it's vague. So, it's not explicit, which would make it implicit. Since it's vague, it doesn't give the authors a clear idea of how to fix it. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't specify how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is about the paper. The reviewer mentions baselines lacking prior knowledge, which is somewhat specific, but it's not clear which part of the paper or method they're referring to. They don't name a section or a particular aspect, so it's not fully grounded. However, they do imply it's about the comparison, which is a specific area. So, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not entirely clear but does point to a specific issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is suggesting a better comparison but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the current comparison is unfair or why a better one is needed. There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. Therefore, this should be **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a flaw in the comparison but isn't providing concrete suggestions on how to improve it. They're making a suggestion but not expanding on it or explaining why it's necessary. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully detailed or actionable.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions several issues: output-side layers not benefiting, Figure 4 not being clear, details of Pixel-shuffle not presented, a question about Pixel-shuffle in super-resolution, upsampling dimensionality, and limitations not provided. It seems like the reviewer is pointing out multiple areas for improvement. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is directly stating each issue, so that's explicit. But are the actions clear? The reviewer suggests improvements but doesn't specify exactly how to do them. For example, they say \"why the dimensionality remains the same\" but don't explain what needs to be done. So, it's explicit but vague. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions specific parts like Figure 4 and details of Pixel-shuffle. They also ask about the upsampling dimensionality. This shows that the reviewer is pinpointing specific sections and aspects of the paper, which is good grounding. They're not just talking about the paper as a whole but specific elements, so this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the issues. For example, stating that the output-side layers don't benefit, the figure isn't clear, etc. Each of these claims is supported by the reviewer's observations and logical reasoning. They're not citing external references, but their explanations are clear and logical. So, this should be **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer provides several points, each suggesting specific improvements. They cover a range of issues from figures to methodology and limitations. While it's a bit broad, each point is actionable and constructive. The reviewer doesn't seem to be making unfounded claims but is based on their observations. This makes the feedback helpful overall, so it's a **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that negative chips are fixed or updated during RPN training. It also asks if alternating between generating and training would help performance. The action here is clear: the authors should check if the chips are fixed or if they need to be updated. But the instructions for improvement are a bit vague. They don't specify how to check or what exactly needs to be done. So, it's explicit that an action is needed but not detailed on how to implement it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions negative chips and training but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this refers to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is, so they don't know what to address. This means the grounding is weak because they can't identify the exact section or issue. So, it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just poses a question without supporting it with references or logical reasoning. There's no claim made, so it falls into the **X: No Claim** category.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question and suggesting an improvement but doesn't provide clear guidance.

So, I'll give it a 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions evaluating on new and old patients but doesn't specify which parts of the paper or sections of the document to focus on. It's vague about the exact issues. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. It's also not specific because it doesn't detail what needs to be addressed. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or reasoning for why evaluating on new and old patients is necessary. It just states the action without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing for the claim. That gives it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review suggests an action but doesn't explain why it's important or how it helps. It's vague and doesn't offer concrete advice. So, it's somewhat helpful because it does point out an area for improvement, but it's incomplete. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable, weakly grounded, unverifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a formal definition of the split arrows in Figure 2. It's explicit about the need for a definition, which is good. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to add the definition or where in the paper it should go. It's a bit vague on the implementation details. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still have to figure out where to place the definition and how to structure it. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figure 2 and specifically asks about the split arrows related to the attention layer. It accurately points out the part of the paper being addressed, which is good. It also clearly explains what needs to be addressed, which is the definition of the split arrows. So, it's fully grounded and specific. That would be a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that there's a split arrow in Figure 2 and asks for a formal definition. It provides some reasoning by guessing that the split arrows represent query, keys, and values, but it doesn't back this up with external references or logical reasoning. It's a bit unclear, so I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out a lack of mathematical detail and asking for a definition. It provides a specific suggestion, which is helpful. However, it doesn't elaborate on why this is important or how it affects the overall understanding. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. So, I'd give it a **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Let me double-check each rating to make sure they align with the definitions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
{"generated_text": "{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n} <think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate this review point: \"The presentation of this paper is hard to follow for the reviewer.\" The user has provided a detailed structure to assess four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Each has its own scale from 1 to 5, with explanations for each score.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says the presentation is hard to follow. Is this explicit or implicit? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out an issue but isn't giving a specific action. They might want the author to improve clarity, but they don't specify how. So, it's not explicit. Is it concrete? No, because it doesn't tell the author exactly what to do. So, it's probably a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This is about whether the review refers to a specific part of the paper. The comment just says the presentation is hard to follow, which is pretty vague. It doesn't mention any specific section, table, or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint where the issue is. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's making a judgment about the paper's presentation. But is there any support for this claim? The reviewer doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning. They just state that it's hard to follow. So, there's no justification, making it unverifiable. Hence, verifiability is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is clear and points out a problem, but it's very vague. It doesn't suggest specific changes or improvements. The author might know they need to make the presentation clearer, but there's no guidance on how. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Therefore, helpfulness is a 1.\n\nPutting it all together, all four aspects get a 1 because the review point is vague and doesn't provide specific actions or justifications.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review point suggests the reviewer isn't familiar with DMM and DVBF in detail but understands their differences from KVAE. The reviewer wants a more detailed presentation of the compared models and specifically asks about the computation requirements of the three methods in Table 1. \n\n- **Explicitness:** The reviewer is asking for more details, which is explicit.\n- **Concreteness:** The reviewer is asking about computation requirements, which is specific.\n\nHowever, the review doesn't provide explicit instructions on how to improve the presentation or where to find the detailed information. It's clear the reviewer wants more, but the action isn't fully detailed. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit and concrete.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe reviewer refers to Table 1 by name, which is explicit. They also ask about computation requirements, which is a specific aspect of the methods. The comment is clear about which part of the paper it's addressing, so it's fully grounded. Additionally, they specify what needs to be addressed, making it specific.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe reviewer is asking for a comparison of computation requirements. This is a claim because it's a suggestion for improvement. The justification is that the reviewer wants more details, but it's not supported by external references or logical reasoning. It's a straightforward request without much backing, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe reviewer is asking for a specific improvement and a detailed comparison. This is clear and actionable. The request is specific enough for the authors to consider, and it's directly related to their work. It's helpful but could be expanded for more comprehensive feedback.\n\nSo, based on these evaluations, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding_specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 3\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The authors conduct experiments on T5, PaLM and GPT series LLMs and show the influence of parameter size on benchmark score. However, I think more experiments on different famous LLMs like LLaMA, Falcon, etc are needed as benchmark baselines.\n\n**Review Point Analysis:**\n\n**Actionability (1-5): 2**\n- The review suggests adding experiments on specific models but doesn't specify how to implement this, making it implicit and vague.\n\n**Grounding Specificity (1-5): 3**\n- The comment mentions specific models (LLaMA, Falcon) but doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper being addressed, only implying it through the need for more experiments.\n\n**Verifiability (1-5): 3**\n- The claim is to add experiments, but there's no justification or evidence provided, making it unverifiable.\n\n**Helpfulness (1-5): 3**\n- The comment provides a suggestion but lacks clarity and justification, making it somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a comparison of real search costs in GPU days to Table 3. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. The action is clear: compare the real search cost with the number of queries. It doesn't leave any ambiguity, so it's not implicit. Also, the comment provides a concrete example of how to implement the change by mentioning GPU days. So, this is highly actionable. I think it should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"Table 3\" and specifies \"real search cost (e.g., in terms of GPU days).\" This clearly identifies the part of the paper being referred to, so it's fully grounded. Additionally, it specifies exactly what needs to be addressed, which makes it specific. Therefore, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim suggesting a specific improvement. It's supported by the idea that comparing real search costs could be beneficial. However, it doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion itself. It's somewhat vague in terms of justification. So, I'd rate this as 3 because it's verifiable but lacks depth in supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a clear area for improvement by suggesting a specific metric to add to the table. It's actionable and provides a direct suggestion, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go beyond that; it doesn't offer alternative solutions or weigh the importance of the suggestion. So, while it's helpful, it's not the most comprehensive. I think a 4 is appropriate here because it's mostly helpful but could be expanded.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring that each score reflects the clarity, specificity, justification, and overall value to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions including certain works and discussing how their work differs from others. It doesn't specify exactly what changes the authors should make, like adding experiments or modifying methods. So, it's not giving clear actions. But it's pretty explicit about the suggestions, so maybe it's borderline actionable. I think it's a 5 because it's clear about the direction but lacks specifics on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review references specific works by Li et al. and He et al. It clearly mentions these papers, so the grounding is strong. It also explains why these comparisons are useful, which adds specificity. So, this should be a 5 because it accurately points to the sections and explains the relevance.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests including other works and comparing them. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to back up why these comparisons are necessary. It's vague on how these comparisons would help or why they're important. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary justification. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting relevant works and their importance. It guides the authors to include these references and compare their work to others, which is helpful. It's not the most detailed but provides meaningful feedback. So, it's a 5 because it's clear and guides the authors effectively.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that DualIS and DualDIS aren't generic on some cross-model retrieval tasks, specifically pointing out MSVD in Table 3. It's explicit about the issue, so that's good. But it doesn't tell the authors what to do next. They don't know if they should adjust the methods or maybe try something else. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete actions. I think this is **Borderline Actionable** because it's clear there's a problem but doesn't specify how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"some cross-model retrieval tasks\" and specifically mentions \"MSVD (Table 3)\". It's not entirely clear which part of the paper is being addressed beyond that. The authors might have to infer which section to focus on, which isn't fully grounded. So, this is **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because it's not entirely clear what part is being discussed, and it doesn't clearly detail what needs fixing.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the performance in MSVD shows minor improvements. It's making a claim that the methods aren't generic, which is a judgment. It's supported by the data in Table 3, so there's some backing. However, it's not fully detailed or robust. Maybe it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but not enough depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and provides some data, but it doesn't offer clear guidance on how to address it. The authors still need to figure out what changes to make. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this as **Somewhat Helpful** because it does provide some value but lacks the depth needed for comprehensive improvement.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, justification, and guidance provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"in-between\" uncertainty and specifies that the forward quote should be used. It's clear and directly points to the part of the paper, so this is fully grounded and specific. No guesswork here, so another 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It just says to change the quote, which isn't helpful for the author to understand why or how to do it. There's no justification provided, so this is unverifiable. I'll give it a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does provide a specific correction, which is helpful. However, it doesn't explain why the change is necessary or how it affects the paper.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"the models are learned directly from pixels without a Markovian state.\" It mentions an action, pointing out that the models don't use a Markovian state. But it doesn't tell the authors what to do next. They don't get an explicit instruction on how to improve their models. So, it's not actionable because there's no clear step or change they should make. That would be a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about Markovian states without specifying which part of the paper it's referring to. It doesn't mention any specific section, table, or figure. So, the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. That's also a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment states a fact: models are learned from pixels without a Markovian state. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no explanation of why this is a problem or how it affects the work. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. That gives a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a specific issue but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It just states a fact without context or guidance. The authors don't know what changes to make or why this is a problem. So, it's not helpful at all. That's a 1 for helpfulness.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the sequence example is useful but points out that using Hamming distance over the entire sequence is a 'common' practice. It suggests looking for references. The action here is pointing out a common practice, which is explicit. However, the reviewer doesn't specify exactly where to look or how to find those references. So, it's explicit but lacks detail, making it somewhat actionable. I think this should be a 4 because it's clear but not fully detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"entire parts of the sequence\" and \"node wise.\" This is pretty specific, pointing out exact sections and methods. They also suggest looking for references, which is clear. So, this is fully grounded and specific. I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer claims that using Hamming distance over the entire sequence is common.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment suggests changing the name from \"Evaluation\" to \"Metrics\" and mentions removing corresponding sections, adding metrics to captions, etc. It's pretty explicit about the changes, so that's good. But does it tell the authors exactly how to implement these changes? Not really. They might know to update the name and add metrics but not specifics like which datasets to use or how to calculate them. So it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That would be a 4 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment talks about changing the name and adding metrics but doesn't specify which parts of the paper or datasets to use. It's vague about the exact sections or how to implement the changes. So the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint the referenced part. The specificity is also low since it doesn't clearly detail what needs to be addressed. This would be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment mentions standard practices and datasets but doesn't provide any references or examples. It's clear that the suggestions are based on common knowledge, but without external sources, it's hard to verify. So it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. That's a 3 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does suggest changes and mentions adding metrics, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance on what metrics to use or how to implement them. So while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully detailed. That would be a 4 for helpfulness.\n\nOverall, the comment is clear about the changes but lacks detailed specifics, making it somewhat actionable and helpful but not fully.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"The new proposed dataset, DRRI, could have been explored more in the paper.\" The first thing I notice is that it's suggesting an improvement, but it's not giving a specific action. It just says \"could have been explored more.\" So, the action is implicit because the reviewer is implying that the dataset should be used more, but they're not telling the author exactly what to do. \n\nLooking at the criteria for actionability, it's either explicit or implicit. Explicit would be something like, \"Add the DRRI dataset to the experiments,\" whereas implicit is more vague, like this. Since it's not specifying how to explore the dataset more, it's implicit. Now, for the concreteness part, implicit actions are usually vague, so this doesn't provide detailed guidance on what changes to make. Therefore, it's not actionable because the author doesn't know exactly what to do. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the new proposed dataset, DRRI.\" It's referring to a specific part of the paper\u2014the dataset. So, the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the part of the paper, which means it's fully grounded. However, the comment doesn't specify what needs to be done with the dataset. It just says it could have been explored more, which is a bit vague. But since it's pointing to a specific part, the grounding is solid. But because it's not clear what needs to be addressed, maybe it's only weakly grounded? Wait, no, the definition says if it's a general comment that clearly implies the relevant parts without explicitly naming them, it's weakly grounded. But in this case, it does name the dataset, so it's fully grounded. However, since it's not specific about what needs to be done, maybe it's not fully specific. But the grounding part is about identifying the part, which it does. So, I think grounding_specificity would be 2 because it's fully grounded but not specific about the issue.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review is making a judgment that the dataset could have been explored more, which is a claim. Now, is this claim supported by evidence? The reviewer is just stating an opinion that more exploration is needed, without providing any references or logical reasoning. There's no external data or citations backing this up. So, the claim is not well-supported. Therefore, verifiability would be 1 because it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review suggests that the dataset should be explored more but doesn't provide specific actionable steps. It's vague and doesn't give the author a clear path forward. Without concrete suggestions, the feedback isn't very helpful. So, it's only marginally helpful, but not highly so. Therefore, helpfulness would be 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability:1, grounding_specificity:2, verifiability:1, helpfulness:1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

This is an explicit action. However, it doesn't specify how to implement this change, such as providing examples or alternative metrics. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - The review mentions \"axes\" and \"networks\" but doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper. It refers to the axes being \"squished\" and suggests an improvement that's difficult to characterize.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"As with most work on pruning, it is not yet possible to realize efficiency gains on GPU.\" The action here is pointing out that pruning isn't efficient on GPUs. But it doesn't tell the authors what to do next. It's more of a statement than a suggestion. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's just pointing out a problem without giving a clear fix. That means it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to improve. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions pruning and GPUs but doesn't specify which part of the paper or method it's referring to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is because it's a general statement. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being discussed. Therefore, grounding_specificity is also 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that pruning isn't efficient on GPUs. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's just an opinion without backing. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or references. That means verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a problem but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions on how to address it. It's just stating that pruning isn't efficient on GPUs without providing any actionable steps. Since it doesn't help the authors improve their work, it's not helpful. So, helpfulness is 1.\n\nOverall, the review is lacking in all four aspects because it doesn't provide clear actions, specific references, verifiable claims, or helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

The review is asking a question, but does it tell the authors what to do? It seems like it's just posing a question without giving any specific instructions. So, the authors still don't know how to improve their draft based on this. That means it's not actionable. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions \"men and women\" and \"insurance,\" but it's too vague. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing, like a particular table or figure. It's just a general question without pinpointing the issue. So, the authors can't confidently identify which section is being referred to. That makes it weakly grounded. Also, it's not specific about what needs to be addressed. So, grounding specificity is 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is a question, not a claim. Since there's no claim being made, it doesn't require verification. So, it's an \"X\" for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is a question but doesn't provide any actionable feedback or suggestions. It doesn't help the authors know what to do or why their work is lacking. So, it's not helpful at all, which is a 1.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 1 except verifiability, which is X, and helpfulness also 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out specific sections and lines where references are needed and mentions Figure 2 without explaining what \"MLP\" is. Explicitly asking for references and Figure 2 is clear, so that's good. But the comment doesn't tell the authors exactly where to find \"MLP\" or how to add the references. It's vague on the implementation details, so it's not fully actionable. I think this is a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific sections (lines 230-234 and 234-235) and Figure 2, which is good. It clearly identifies where the issues are, so the grounding is strong. It also explains what needs to be addressed, which is specific. I'd rate this a 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding references but doesn't provide any justification or examples. It just says \"please provide references,\" which is a claim without support. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear about needing references and Figure 2 but doesn't offer any guidance on how to add them or where to find the information. It's somewhat helpful but not very detailed. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it's somewhat helpful but could be more comprehensive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the training time reduction is less drastic than the parameter reduction because most gradients are still computed for early down-sampling layers. It mentions the Discussion section but says to delete it. I think the action here is pointing out that the Discussion doesn't need revisiting, but it's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly what to do next. It's not clear if they need to make any changes or how to implement it. So, I'd say it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it suggests a change but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the Discussion section, which is a part of the paper, so that's grounding. It also mentions gradients and down-sampling layers, which are specific technical details. So, the grounding is pretty solid. The specificity is good too because it explains why the reduction is less drastic and what part of the model is involved. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the Discussion doesn't need revisiting and suggests deleting it. There's no external reference or explanation, just a statement. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully verifiable. Maybe it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it's clear but lacks justification.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out an improvement needed in the Discussion but doesn't specify what changes to make. It's clear and actionable in pointing out the issue, but without more details, it's somewhat helpful. So, I'd rate it **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point is asking if the problem applies to other downstream tasks or is specific to binding affinity prediction. It's a good question, but does it give the authors a clear action? It seems like it's prompting for more information rather than telling them what to do. So, it's not explicit or vague. I think this is **unactionable**, so a score of 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review is asking about other downstream tasks, but it's not clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's more of a general question. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinning down exactly where the issue is. This would be a **Not Grounded** score, which is 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim by asking if the problem applies elsewhere. But it's not providing any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's just a question without backing, so it's **unverifiable**. The label here would be 1, and since there's no claim, it's marked as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a question that could be useful, but it's not giving specific advice or pointing out weaknesses. It's more of a probing question without actionable steps. So, it's not very helpful, maybe just barely helpful. But according to the scale, it's more like a 1 because it doesn't provide clear guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 1 because the review point doesn't provide clear actions, grounding, evidence, or helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the technical contribution is limited because Section 4 isn't a formal solution but heuristics. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do. So, it's not giving a clear action. I think this is borderline because it points out an issue but doesn't specify how to fix it. So, I'd give it a 2.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Section 4 but doesn't specify what exactly is wrong. It just says it's not formal. The authors might not know where to focus their improvements. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper being addressed. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that Section 4 isn't formal, which is a claim. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just an opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't suggest improvements.

It doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done, like adding a discussion section or providing specific feedback. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give clear instructions on how to address it. That makes it somewhat actionable, but not fully.

It's a bit vague, so the grounding isn't strong. It mentions the topic but doesn't pin it down to a specific part. I think this is a 2 because it's not fully grounded but also not weak.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests discussing connections with another paper. It doesn't provide any specific reasoning or references to back this up. It's just a suggestion without justification, so it's not very verifiable. Maybe a 2 here because it's not completely unverifiable but lacks support.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a relevant reference and suggests a discussion, which is helpful. However, it doesn't specify how to implement this suggestion or what exactly should be discussed. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed.

It suggests that one traffic signal shouldn't know the color of the next one. However, it doesn't provide specific actions or modifications the authors should make. It's more of a critique and a question, so it's not actionable.

It's a bit vague, so I'd say it's weakly grounded. It does explain why the approach is better but doesn't specify exactly where or how it applies, so maybe a 3.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that privacy preservation is an issue for traffic signals. However, it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It's just a statement without justification, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review does point out a potential issue with the approach but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or explanations. It's more of a critique without actionable advice, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nOverall, the review is somewhat helpful but lacks in providing clear actions and verifiable claims.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing CPEF with ExpertBert to make the comparison fair. It's explicit about the action, which is to recommend a comparison. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this\u2014like which specific changes to make or where to find ExpertBert. So it's explicit but lacks concrete details.

It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed\u2014Figure 3 and lines 529-534. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the fairness of the comparison. So it's fully grounded and specific. That's a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim suggesting a fairer comparison. It provides a recommendation but doesn't back it up with evidence or reasoning. It's clear and logical, but lacks justification. So it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review gives a clear recommendation and explains why the current comparison is unfair. It's actionable and provides a specific alternative. While it could be more detailed, it's helpful enough to guide the authors. So it's a **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the task is more about Argument Mining than Summarization and suggests clarifying differences. It doesn't specify what changes to make, so it's not explicit. It's vague because it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to improve. So, it's somewhere between 2 and 3. I think 3 because it's explicit about the task but lacks detail on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the task being Argument Mining but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It's too general, so the authors don't know where to focus. That's weak grounding because it's not specific enough. So, I'd rate this as 3 because it's not fully grounded but there's a slight improvement over being weak.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors should explain the linear program in Theorem 3 more intuitively. It mentions that the reader would benefit from knowing the objective and constraints. This seems like a clear action because it tells the authors exactly what to do. It's not just a suggestion; it's a specific task. Also, it provides enough detail so the authors know exactly how to apply it\u2014by explaining the objective and constraints. So, this should be highly actionable. I think the label here is 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Theorem 3, which is a specific part of the paper. It also asks the authors to explain the objective and constraints, which are specific elements of that theorem. The comment doesn't just mention the theorem; it pinpoints exactly what needs to be addressed. So, the grounding is strong because it clearly identifies the section and what's wrong with it. The specificity is also high because it's not just about the theorem but about its components. Therefore, this should be labeled 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that explaining the theorem intuitively would help the reader. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for this claim. It's an opinion without any references or logical reasoning. So, it's not verifiable. The label here should be 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides a clear suggestion for the authors to improve their explanation of Theorem 3. It's specific about what needs to be done, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go beyond that; it doesn't suggest alternative approaches or how to implement the explanation effectively. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not the most comprehensive feedback. Therefore, the label is 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is highly actionable and well-grounded, but not very verifiable and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It references another paper, which is helpful, but it's not fully verifiable because the reasoning is vague. So I'd give it a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is clear about the need for proof and is open to increasing their score if the authors address the questions. This shows they're encouraging and helpful, so it's a 5.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Actionability is 4 because it's explicit but not concrete. Grounding is 5 because it's fully grounded and specific. Verifiability is 4 because it's mostly verifiable with some gaps.

The authors' response addresses some of these, but the review itself doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. It just points out the issues. So, it's not giving clear actions.

So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Algorithm 2 and mentions specific terms like 'avg', j', and i''. The authors' response does address these, so the grounding is pretty clear. The review isn't just pointing to a general area but specifically mentions parts of the paper, which is good. I think this is \"Fully Grounded and Specific,\" so a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that Algorithm 2 is unclear and suggests that 'avg' isn't used. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up these claims. It's just stating opinions without justification. So, this should be \"Unverifiable,\" which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify some issues with Algorithm 2 and provides some questions, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer detailed suggestions or explanations, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive. I'll rate this a 4.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure about the verifiability. The review does ask for clarification, which is a form of justification, but it's not really providing evidence.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that step 3 is the vital part and suggests that the orthogonality of the weight matrix should be studied for validation. It doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done, like suggesting a method or providing an example. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give clear steps on how to validate it. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I think a 3 is appropriate.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to step 3 as vital and mentions the orthogonality of the weight matrix. It doesn't explicitly name a specific part of the paper, but it's clear that it's talking about the methodology section where the weight matrices are discussed. So, it's fully grounded because it can be inferred from the context without needing more details. I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests studying the orthogonality of the weight matrix but doesn't provide any references or examples. It's clear there's a claim here, but the justification is vague. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a specific area that needs study and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance. So, it's mostly helpful, which I'll rate as a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests a possible reason for accuracy dropping, which is overfitting. But it doesn't tell the author exactly what to do next. They might need to check for overfitting, maybe by using cross-validation or regularization, but the review doesn't specify. So it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figure 5 and a certain order of around 4-5. It doesn't specify exactly which part of Figure 5 to look at or what specific issue in that part is causing the drop in accuracy. So the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact section or element. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review presents a claim that accuracy drops due to overfitting. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify a potential issue and suggests a possible reason, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer specific advice on how to address it or any references to back up the claim. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive, making it a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects. Each evaluation is based on whether the review provides clear actions, specific references, justifications, and helpful suggestions to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions specific models and datasets, like CIFAR100 and ResNet variants, and asks for more substantial experiments. It seems like it's giving clear directions on what the authors should do. The comment is explicit about the need for better datasets and models, so that's a strong point. It doesn't just suggest something vague; it actually tells the authors what to change. I think this is highly actionable because it provides concrete steps. So, I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out that the models are too toy-like. It doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper it's referring to, but it's clear that the issue is with the datasets and model architectures. The comment is specific about what's missing, like mentioning CIFAR100 and ResNet models. So, the grounding is pretty solid because it accurately points to the relevant sections without needing more details. I'd rate this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the models are too toy-like and suggests improvements. It provides some justification by mentioning the size of datasets and model architectures, which are well-known benchmarks. However, it doesn't cite specific external references or provide detailed reasoning beyond referencing common practices. It's somewhat verifiable but could be more robust. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it's mostly supported but lacks some depth.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out weaknesses and suggesting improvements. It doesn't just say the work is lacking; it proposes specific changes. The reviewer also offers to raise their score if the questions are addressed, which shows a willingness to help further. This makes the comment quite helpful, so I'd give it a 4. It's mostly helpful but could be a bit more comprehensive.\n\nOverall, the review is quite detailed and constructive, but there's room for more depth in grounding and verifiability.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that some natural ablation studies are missing and gives an example of how scratchGAN would perform if pre-trained. It also asks for minor comments and questions. I think the explicit action here is pointing out the missing studies and suggesting a specific example. However, the suggestion is a bit vague because it doesn't provide a clear method or detailed explanation on how to implement this. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"natural ablation studies\" and mentions \"scratchGAN\" as an example. It doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper it's addressing, like a particular section or figure. It's a bit vague, so I'd say it's weakly grounded. But it does mention what needs to be addressed, which is somewhat specific. So, maybe a 3 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that some ablation studies are missing and suggests a baseline. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's vague and lacks justification, so it's not very verifiable. Maybe a 2 because it's borderline.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out a deficiency and suggests an improvement, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are quite vague and don't provide detailed guidance. It's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or specificity that would make them fully actionable, grounded, verifiable, or helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests the author didn't consider Vision Transformer, which is an important model, and questions if it works for larger datasets like ImageNet. It also asks if the pruning strategy is different in self-attention layers. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a missing consideration of a specific model and suggests a follow-up question. However, the suggestion is a bit vague because it's asking a yes/no question without providing a clear action or direction on how to proceed. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does mention the action of pointing out a missing element but doesn't give a clear step on what to do next. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions Vision Transformer as an important SOTA model in image classification and refers to ImageNet. This seems pretty specific because they're naming a specific model and a specific dataset. They also imply the concern about larger datasets, which is a clear reference. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific,\" which is a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that Vision Transformer isn't suitable for ImageNet and questioning the pruning strategy. The reviewer is asking for clarification, which is a claim that needs justification. However, there's no supporting evidence or references provided. The justification is vague because it's just a question without any reasoning or external sources. So, this is \"Unverifiable\" with a label of X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out a missing consideration and asking a relevant question, which provides some value. However, the suggestion is vague and doesn't offer a clear path forward. It's helpful in identifying an area for improvement but lacks depth. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful\" with a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the contribution isn't enough and mentions addressing overfitting with limited data and proposes differentiable augmentation. It ends by saying it's important but still limited. Hmm, the comment points out a problem and suggests an improvement, but it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They might know to try different augmentation, but it's vague. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which makes it borderline actionable because it does hint at an action but lacks specifics. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the overfitting problem and differentiable augmentation but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs fixing. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is or what to improve. So, this is not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part or issue. It's weak grounding since they can't even guess where it's pointing. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review talks about overfitting and differentiable augmentation but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just stating problems without supporting them with data or references. There's no logical reasoning or external sources backing up the claims. So, it's unverifiable. Verifiability_label is 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are vague, and the reasoning behind them isn't provided. The authors might know to try something, but without specifics, it's not very helpful. It's better than nothing but not fully helpful. So, I'd give it a 1 for helpfulness as well.\n\nOverall, the review lacks explicitness, grounding, verifiability, and is somewhat vague, making all four aspects score 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The method does not work very effectively on general reasoning tasks compared with mathematic reasoning.\" It mentions that the method isn't effective on general reasoning but doesn't specify what needs to be done next. So, it's pointing out a problem but not giving a clear action. That makes it **unactionable**, so a score of 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about general reasoning tasks and mathematic reasoning. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or method is affected. It's too vague, so the grounding is weak. Therefore, it's **Not Grounded**, scoring 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that the method isn't effective on general reasoning tasks. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. There's no reference to external studies or logical reasoning to support it. So, it's **Unverifiable**, getting a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation but doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the proof relies on a special case and that the authors acknowledge this in Section 3. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. It just points out a limitation without suggesting an improvement. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Section 3 for acknowledgment, which is specific. It doesn't mention any other parts of the paper, so it's fully grounded. Also, it clearly states what's missing, which is the applicability of Theorem 1 after normalization. That's specific enough, so it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the proof's special case is acknowledged, but it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an observation without supporting evidence, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify a limitation but doesn't offer any suggestions on how to address it. It's clear and identifies an issue, but lacks actionable advice. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing the continuous diffusion model as a baseline in Table 3. It also mentions a recent work using GDSS for conditional generation. I think the action here is clear: compare the models. But the instructions say it's implicit because it's not explicitly stated how to apply the suggestion. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but vague on the exact steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Table 2 and mentions a recent work [2]. It accurately points out specific sections and external references, so this should be fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the claim is that the continuous model outperforms the discrete one. The support includes pointing out Table 2 and citing recent work. This seems logical and supported by references, so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions and references, which should help the authors improve. It's not the most detailed, but it's helpful enough. I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly helpful with some room for more detail.\n\nI think that's a solid evaluation based on the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Although the authors provide beautiful theory proof, the objective of Eq (12) seems to be in contradiction with IPO.\" The action here is pointing out a contradiction, but it doesn't specify how to fix it. It's more of a statement than a clear instruction. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. I think this is a **2: Borderline Actionable** because it hints at a problem but doesn't give a solution.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Eq (12) and refers to IPO. It does point out a specific part of the paper (Eq 12) and explains the contradiction. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it accurately identifies the part and explains the issue clearly.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states a problem but doesn't provide any justification or references. It just says Eq (12) contradicts IPO.

It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it doesn't provide any details on how to implement this change, like where exactly to make the replacement or how it affects the code. So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the specifics are missing. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I'd rate it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions replacing \"t\" with the size of T but doesn't specify which part of the paper or code that refers to. It's vague about the exact location or context. So, the grounding isn't strong because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. I'd give this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests replacing \"t\" with the size of T but doesn't provide any justification or reasoning why this change would be beneficial. It just states the action without backing it up. There's no reference to external literature or logical reasoning, so it's not verifiable.

It also questions whether the adaptation holds for concepts where class labels correlate more with semantics than geometry. The reviewer is pointing out a potential limitation but doesn't suggest a specific change or how to address it. It's more of a question than a suggestion, so it's not actionable. Therefore, it's unactionable, which I'll rate as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer refers to DINO representations containing rich geometric information and discusses class labels correlating with semantics versus geometry. This shows that the reviewer is specifically addressing certain concepts, so the grounding is clear. However, the reviewer doesn't specify exactly what needs to be changed or improved, just poses a question. So it's weakly grounded but not fully specific. I'll give it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is questioning whether DINO's adaptability holds for specific types of concepts. They're relying on their own understanding and observations, not citing external references or providing logical reasoning. This makes the claim somewhat verifiable but not fully supported. So I'll rate it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides some insight into potential limitations but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or clarify doubts. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. I'll rate this a 3 as well.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the content of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**:\n- The review points out several specific typos and formatting issues. For example, Line 029 has a typo that should be corrected, and Line 188 mentions replacing PLN with NLP. These are clear and direct actions the authors can take. Additionally, it suggests fixing a repeated word in Line 264 and correcting a DOI number in Lines 995-996. Each of these is an explicit action with clear instructions, so the review is highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**:\n- The review references specific lines in the document, such as Line 029, Line 188, etc. It doesn't mention any sections, tables, or figures beyond the lines themselves. However, since it's pointing out issues in specific parts of the text, it can be considered grounded because it accurately references the sections being discussed. The specificity is good because it clearly states what needs fixing in those parts.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**:\n- The review contains several claims, such as pointing out typos, suggesting replacements, and correcting formatting issues. Each of these claims is supported by logical reasoning and common knowledge. For example, replacing PLN with NLP is a standard terminology correction. The references are direct and clear, so the verifiability is fully supported. There are no external references needed here, but the logical explanations are sufficient.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\n- The review provides a list of specific issues and clear corrections. Each point is actionable and directly addresses potential problems the authors might have. The suggestions are detailed enough to guide the authors on what needs to be fixed without being overly vague. Therefore, the review is highly helpful as it gives the authors clear directions on how to improve their work.\n\nIn summary, each aspect is scored as follows: Actionability 5, Grounding_specificity 5, Verifiability 5, and Helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**:\n- The review mentions that notation is confusing because M and N are not defined. It suggests spelling out F.L.T.R in Figure 4, making the text too small, and recommends cross-referencing M and N in the figure.\n- The actions here are explicit: suggest defining terms, improving text visibility, and cross-referencing. The suggestions are clear and direct, so this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**:\n- The review points out issues in Figure 1 text and suggests cross-referencing M and N. It doesn't explicitly mention any other parts of the paper besides Figure 1 and Figure 4. However, it does clearly identify the specific sections needing improvement, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**:\n- The claims made are about the clarity of notation and the need for cross-referencing. These are general observations without specific references to external literature or well-established practices. The reasoning is clear but lacks specific examples or citations, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\n- The review provides actionable suggestions for improving notation clarity, text visibility, and cross-referencing. These are concrete and directly address the issues, making it highly helpful for the authors.\n\nSo, each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring that each score reflects the clarity and effectiveness of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment talks about adding a mathematical formulation in the appendix and improving the figure's clarity. It also suggests reworking the figure to better depict the WiC task. These are clear actions the authors can take. The comment doesn't just say \"improve,\" it specifies where and what to add. That makes it actionable. So, I think this is highly actionable because it gives exact steps.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions specific parts of the paper like the appendix and the figure. It doesn't just say \"the paper\" but points out exact sections. It also suggests improvements in those specific areas, which shows grounding. The comment is specific about what needs to be done, so I'd rate this as fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment provides suggestions but doesn't back them up with references or logical reasoning. It just says, for example, \"the figure is too abstract.\" While this is a valid judgment, there's no justification or evidence provided. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it has some basis but lacks supporting details.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment is very helpful because it directly points out areas for improvement and suggests specific changes. It guides the authors without being vague. The suggestions are clear and actionable, which makes it highly helpful. There's no mention of the comment being unhelpful or barely helpful, so this should be a high score.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at a high level, especially actionability, grounding, and helpfulness. The only slightly lower score is verifiability because it lacks some justification, but it's still somewhat verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

It's explicit about these actions, so the author knows exactly what to do. The suggestions are clear and direct, so I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while the actions are clear, they might be a bit vague on how to implement them.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like Figure 4 and downstream tasks, and clearly states what needs to be addressed. It doesn't just refer to general areas but specific sections, so this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims about the comparison results and performance differences. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. The justification is vague, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and points out specific areas for improvement.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors explain how to set a reasonable class-imbalanced task with concrete details. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. But it's vague because it doesn't specify how to do it. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable,\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"class-imbalanced task\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section it's referring to. It's not clearly pointing out a specific section or figure. So, it's weakly grounded because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded either. Since it's not providing clear specifics about what needs fixing, I'd rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" which is a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is asking for an explanation but doesn't provide any evidence or references. It's just a request for more details. There's no logical reasoning or external sources backing up the suggestion. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for more details but doesn't specify how. It's somewhat helpful because it does point out an area for improvement, but it's vague and lacks clarity. So, it's a \"Somewhat Helpful\" score, which is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors should explain what a proper rotation matrix is and clarify the matrix being non-positive semidefinite. It's explicit about the actions, so that's good. But it doesn't give specific instructions on how to do that, like suggesting a reference or a method. So it's not fully actionable because the implementation details are missing. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific lines (97, 105-106) which shows it's grounded because it accurately points to parts of the paper. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, so it's specific. Therefore, this should be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides questions but doesn't back them up with evidence or references. It's just asking the authors to explain certain points, which doesn't help them verify or justify the issues. So it's not very verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does identify areas for improvement and asks specific questions, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide detailed explanations or references, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most helpful. I'd rate this a 4 because it's clear and prompts action, just lacking in depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is a 3 except helpfulness, which is a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests replacing the g activation function with a binary operator, similar to Cohen and Shashua (2016). It's pretty explicit about the change, so that's a clear action. The comment also mentions that this fulfills the required conditions, which gives the authors a direct idea of how to apply the change. Since the action is both explicit and concrete, I think this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions a specific reference, Cohen and Shashua (2016), which clearly points to a particular piece of work. It also explains why the change is relevant, tying it to fulfilling required conditions. This strong grounding makes it easy for the authors to understand exactly what's being suggested. So I'd rate this as 5 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment cites a specific paper and mentions that their operator fulfills certain conditions. While it's good that they reference external work, it could be more detailed. For example, explaining how exactly their operator fulfills the conditions might add more clarity. However, it's still verifiable with the given information, so I'll give it a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific improvement and references an external source, which is helpful. It's clear and provides actionable feedback. While it could be more detailed, it's still quite helpful, so a 5 seems appropriate.\n\nOverall, the review is quite thorough and provides clear guidance, making it highly actionable, grounded, somewhat verifiable, and highly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the captions of Figure 1 and 2 overlapping with the content. It's specific because it points out exactly where the overlap is. It doesn't just say \"there's a problem,\" but specifically refers to the captions. So, this is well-grounded and specific. I'll also give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is suggesting a change but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just says to shrink the captions.

It mentions that the plotted curves are from single runs and might fluctuate. It also points out that the models are small, so there's no excuse for not providing stats. \n\nI think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. It's not just a suggestion; it's a clear action. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it specifies exactly what to do: present means with error bars and at least 10 runs. So, it's both explicit and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about presenting results as a mean over runs and mentions models being small. It doesn't explicitly name a specific part of the paper, but it's clear which aspect is being addressed\u2014model performance statistics. It also specifies what needs to be done, so it's grounded and specific. That's a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that the results should be presented with means and error bars. It doesn't provide any justification or references for this claim. It just states what should be done without explaining why or citing sources. So, it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review gives clear suggestions on how to improve the results presentation. It's specific about what to do and why, which helps the authors a lot. It's mostly helpful because it could be better if it had more context or examples, but as it stands, it's quite useful. So, a 4.\n\nI think that's all. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and the scores make sense given the content of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests the authors add details about the CUDA and PyTorch versions used. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. But it's vague because it doesn't specify how to implement this, like which parts of the paper to reference or how to describe the versions. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to apply this. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the CUDA and PyTorch versions but doesn't specify which part of the paper they should address. It's not pointing to a specific section or figure, so the authors can't confidently identify where to make the changes. Therefore, it's weakly grounded because it doesn't clearly pinpoint the issue. The specificity about the versions is good, but without a clear reference, it's not fully grounded. So, a 3 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim suggesting adding details about the environment. It's supported by the impact of different versions on speed, which is a logical reasoning point. However, it doesn't cite any external references or provide examples of how to describe the versions. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth, so it's a 3 on verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about what needs to be added and why it's important. It provides a specific suggestion without being too vague. The authors will find this helpful as it directly addresses their potential oversight. It's not the most detailed but is sufficient, so a 3 here as well.\n\nOverall, each aspect is moderately addressed, providing some guidance but needing more clarity or specifics to be fully effective.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that fully realistic datasets will make it hard to control multiple aspects of variation with precision. It also mentions agreeing with the authors' judgment about no immediate societal impact. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the review gives a clear action or suggests something the authors can do. The first part talks about the difficulty of controlling variables, which is a problem, but it doesn't tell the authors what to do next. It just states the issue. The second part is a statement of agreement, which doesn't provide any actionable steps. So, this doesn't explicitly tell the authors how to improve their work, making it unactionable. So, I'd give it a 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This looks at whether the review refers to a specific part of the paper and explains what's wrong. The review mentions \"fully realistic datasets\" and the difficulty in controlling variables, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or analysis this refers to. It's too vague. Also, it doesn't clearly explain what needs to be addressed. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the issue. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific, which would be a 1 in this scale.\n\nFor **verifiability**, I need to check if the review contains a claim and if it's supported. The review does make a judgment that realistic datasets are hard to control, which is a claim. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this. It's just a statement without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to support the claim. That would be a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is somewhat critical, pointing out a limitation of realistic datasets, but it's just a statement of agreement without offering any specific suggestions or improvements. It doesn't help the authors much because there's no actionable feedback. So, it's only barely helpful, giving it a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is quite low because the review doesn't provide much in terms of actionable feedback, specific references, verifiable claims, or helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment suggests adding an evaluation metric but doesn't specify what that metric is or how to apply it. It's vague about the changes needed. So, it's not explicit, and the action isn't clear. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it hints at an action but doesn't detail how to implement it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez and G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez (2020) but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is needed. It's general, so the authors can't pinpoint where to make the changes. This is \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting the use of an evaluation metric. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's vague, so it's \"Unverifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does offer a suggestion, which is helpful. It provides a direction for improvement but lacks specifics. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nI think that's a solid breakdown. Each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the provided review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

However, it lacks specific references or detailed reasoning.  \n   - **Score**: 3 (Somewhat Verifiable)\n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   - The review is helpful as it points out a potential improvement and suggests further study.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a calculation of the KL-divergence to check if it approaches zero. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But it's vague on how to implement it\u2014like, do they mean adding code, or just suggesting the calculation? Since it's just a suggestion without specifics, it's not fully actionable. So I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions equation (3) and the KL-divergence term. It's pretty specific about which part of the paper it's addressing. It doesn't just say \"Section 3.3\" but refers to a specific equation. Also, it clearly states what's wrong, which is good. So this should be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting an experiment to calculate the KL-divergence. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for why this is necessary or how it would help. It's just a vague suggestion without backing, so it's unverifiable. That would be a score of 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific issue and asking for an experiment, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague on how to proceed. It doesn't give concrete steps or examples, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully detailed. So I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

I doubt that the paper in its present state is strong enough for ICLR.\" Let me break it down based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says the paper isn't strong enough for ICLR. That's a statement of doubt, but does it tell the authors what to do? It doesn't suggest any specific changes or improvements. So, it's not explicit or pointing out exactly what needs to be done. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is. The comment just says the paper isn't strong enough, but it doesn't point to any specific part of the paper or what exactly is lacking. It's too vague. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the issue. I'd give this a 1 as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the paper isn't strong enough. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a statement of opinion without any backing. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting reasoning or references. This also gets a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is a critique but lacks specific suggestions. It doesn't tell the authors what to change or how to improve their work. It's just a negative opinion without actionable steps. So, it's not very helpful. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nOverall, the review is negative but lacks the necessary details and justifications to be useful for the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"It is unclear what the major contributions of the paper are. Analyzing previous work does not constitute as a contribution.\" The first part, \"It is unclear what the major contributions of the paper are,\" is a statement of fact, not an action. The second part, \"Analyzing previous work does not constitute as a contribution,\" is a suggestion, which is an action. However, the suggestion is vague because it doesn't specify how to analyze previous work or what kind of contribution it should be. So, it's an implicit action but lacks concrete details. That would make it borderline actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the major contributions\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be done. It's a general statement, so the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint the issue. There's no specific part mentioned, so it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor verifiability, the review contains a claim that \"Analyzing previous work does not constitute as a contribution.\" This is a subjective judgment. There's no supporting evidence or references provided to back this up. It's a personal opinion without justification, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out that the major contributions are unclear and that analyzing previous work isn't a contribution. However, it doesn't provide specific suggestions on what the authors should do to improve their work. It's vague and doesn't guide them on how to proceed, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully constructive.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a notation for vectors, asking about normalization, and the method for nearest neighbors. These are all specific actions the authors can take. The instructions are clear, so the reviewer is providing explicit guidance. Since the actions are direct and the details are concrete, this should be highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions specific parts of the paper, like the equation and the process of computing nearest neighbors. They also ask about normalization and the method used. This shows that the reviewer is pointing out exact areas in the paper, which means the comment is fully grounded. Additionally, they're being specific about the details needed, so this should score a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the need for notation, the method of normalization, and the computation method for nearest neighbors. Each of these claims is supported by logical reasoning and common knowledge in the field. For example, it's common knowledge that vectors are often denoted with a specific symbol, and cosine similarity is a standard method. The reviewer isn't just stating facts but also providing justifications, so this is fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review point provides clear, actionable suggestions and covers multiple areas the authors might need to consider. While it's a bit brief, it's still very helpful because it addresses several potential issues without being overwhelming. So, I'll rate this as 4, since it's mostly helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nOverall, the review point is comprehensive and directly helpful to the authors, making it highly actionable, grounded, verifiable, and mostly helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that experiments should be run multiple times and suggests a community effort for reproducibility. It also references a specific paper. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. But is it concrete? It says to run experiments multiple times, which is clear, but it doesn't specify how many times or what exactly to do beyond that. So I'd say it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks some details.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review references a specific paper by Henderson et al. and talks about reproducibility and running multiple experiments. It also mentions a critical thing among considerations. I believe this is fully grounded because it clearly points to a specific part of the paper and what needs to be addressed. So the grounding_specificity label should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests running experiments multiple times and references a specific paper. It doesn't provide much justification beyond that, but the reference is a well-known paper, so it's somewhat verifiable. I think it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it has a reference but doesn't explain why the suggestion is good or how the paper should be improved.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review offers suggestions about experiments and reproducibility, references a specific paper, and mentions a critical consideration. It's clear and actionable, but it could be expanded. So I'd rate it **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's helpful but not overly detailed.\n\nI think that's a solid evaluation based on the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The comment says, \"There are some minor issues: Please check Figure 2, Line 433, and Line 468. Some equations end with a period, while others end with a comma. Please ensure they are consistent.\" \n\nFirst, is this an explicit action? Yes, it tells the authors exactly where to check (Figure 2, Lines 433 and 468). So that's explicit. Now, is the action clear? It tells them to check specific lines and that the punctuation should be consistent. It also gives a clear instruction on what to do. So, it's not just vague; it's specific about what needs to be fixed. \n\nTherefore, this should be highly actionable because the authors know exactly where to look and what to do. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 2 and specific lines (433 and 468). It's clear which parts of the paper are being referred to. It doesn't just say \"check something\" but points to exact locations. Also, it specifies what the issue is (punctuation consistency). So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the sections, and the specificity is about the exact problem. Therefore, this should be fully grounded and specific, scoring a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that there are issues with punctuation. It's a clear statement. Now, is this claim supported? The comment doesn't provide any reasoning or references. It just states that the punctuation should be consistent. There's no explanation of why this is a problem or how it affects the paper. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification given. Therefore, it's unverifiable, scoring a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear and tells the authors exactly where to look and what to fix. It's specific and actionable. However, it doesn't suggest any particular solutions beyond checking the punctuation. It's helpful but could be improved by providing more guidance on how to fix the punctuation or what to do if they encounter the issue. So, it's mostly helpful, scoring a 4.\n\nI think that's a thorough evaluation. Each aspect was considered based on the definitions provided, and I walked through each point to determine the appropriate score.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Therefore, the technical contribution of the paper is limited.\" Let's break it down based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review points out a similarity between two methods and concludes that the technical contribution is limited. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. But does it tell the authors exactly how to improve? It suggests that the contribution is limited, but it doesn't specify what changes are needed. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details on how to apply the action. That might make it borderline actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to kNN-ECD and kNN-MT without specifying which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where the issue lies. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. It's more of a general statement.\n\nFor verifiability, the claim is that the technical contribution is limited. The comment doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. It's just a statement without supporting references or logical reasoning. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing to support the claim.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out a problem and suggests a limitation, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide specific guidance on what changes to make. It's somewhat vague, so while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed or constructive feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at the lowest level. Actionability is explicit but lacks detail, grounding is weak, verifiability is lacking, and helpfulness is present but not strong. So, all four aspects would be labeled as 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the figures are either real or artificial and asks if real experiments should be conducted. It's explicit about the question, so that's good. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. They might need to design experiments or analyze the data further. So it's not fully actionable because the next steps aren't specified. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Figure 1 specifically by asking about its origin. It's clear which part of the paper is being discussed, so that's fully grounded. Then, it asks about conducting real experiments, which is specific to the figures. So both grounding and specificity are met, making this a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the figures are either real or artificial. It suggests conducting real experiments, which is a logical reasoning step. It doesn't reference external literature, but the reasoning is clear. So it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a direct question about the figures and suggesting an improvement. It's clear and provides a specific area for the authors to focus. It doesn't go beyond that, but it's helpful enough to guide them. So this is a 4.\n\nI think that's all. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and the scores make sense given the content of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"an example and perhaps a figure would be quite helpful in explaining the definition of uniform shattering.\" The user is suggesting adding examples or figures to clarify a concept. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the reviewer gives a clear instruction on what to do. In this case, the reviewer is suggesting adding elements, but they don't specify how to add them or where exactly. It's a bit vague. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because they do suggest an action, but it's not very detailed. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in pointing out the part of the paper. The reviewer is talking about adding examples or figures, but they don't mention a specific section or figure number. They're just giving a general idea. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing exactly where the issue is. I'd rate this a **3** because it's not fully grounded but also not weak.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. They're saying examples would help, but they don't explain why or how that would make the explanation better. There's no reference to external knowledge or logical reasoning. So, this is **Unverifiable**, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer is providing a suggestion to improve the paper, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is quite vague\u2014just adding examples and figures without specifics. It might be useful for the author to know what to add, but without more details, it's somewhat limited. So, I think this is **Somewhat Helpful**, a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that the assumption among classes is not practice and mentions that the formulation is somewhat trivial. It talks about optimization and theoretical analysis but doesn't specify how to improve it. I think the comment is pointing out an issue but doesn't give clear steps on what to do next. So, it's not explicit because it's more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's not giving concrete actions, it's probably not actionable. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions that the assumption isn't practiced but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be addressed. It talks about optimization and theoretical properties but doesn't clearly identify the issue. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or problem. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 3 since it's weakly grounded but not fully.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment states that the assumption is not practiced and that the formulation is somewhat trivial. It mentions optimization and theoretical analysis but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's making a judgment about the paper's triviality but lacks justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully supported. Hence, verifiability is 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that the assumption isn't practiced and that the formulation is trivial, which is a helpful critique. However, it doesn't provide specific suggestions on how to improve it or where to look for better practices. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that increasing model size can hurt performance and references another paper. It suggests providing more details on the experimental results. The action here is clear: authors should provide more details. But the instruction isn't very specific on how to do that, like whether they should expand on the methods or what kind of details are needed. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review references Ni et al. and talks about model size on Wikipedia. It does mention a specific paper, which is good, but it's a bit vague about what exactly needs to be provided. It doesn't pin down whether it's the methodology or the results. So the grounding is weak because it's not as precise as it could be. That's a 3 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that increasing model size can hurt performance and references another paper. The reference is specific, so that's good. It's verifiable because it's citing an external source, which adds credibility. So this should be a 4, as it's mostly verifiable with a solid reference.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue with model size and references another study. It's clear and provides a reason for concern, which is helpful. However, it doesn't suggest specific fixes, so it's somewhat general.

The comment is explicit about wanting experiments, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify how to apply this action, like which experiments or what results to look for. So, it's explicit but lacks detail, making it somewhat actionable. I think a 3 here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"related experiments\" but doesn't pin down which part of the paper or what specific issue they're addressing. It's vague about where to find these experiments. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just says \"I'm curious to see some related experiments.\" There's no logical reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. Maybe a 3 here since it's somewhat vague.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest an improvement by asking for experiments, which is helpful.

This is essentially just a 1-dimensional line search on a convex function, so even something as basic as a bisecting line search will converge linearly. While of course quadratic convergence is better than linear convergence, how much of an impact does this actually make on the run-time of the algorithm? Experiments along these lines would help motivate the need for the analysis/algorithm.\n\nLet's break down the evaluation for each aspect:\n\n**Actionability (1-5):**\n\n- **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The review explicitly states that the Newton algorithm's motivation is lacking and compares it to a bisecting line search. This is an explicit action, so it's not implicit.\n- **Concrete vs. Vague:** The reviewer provides a specific example (bisecting line search) and suggests experiments to measure impact. This gives clear guidance on what needs to be done, making it concrete.\n\n**Actionability Label:** 4 (Mostly Actionable)\n\n**Grounding Specificity (1-5):**\n\n- **Grounding:** The review refers to section 4 and specifically mentions the Newton algorithm, making it fully grounded.\n- **Specificity:** The reviewer explains the motivation by comparing it to a simpler method and suggests experiments, which clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n**Grounding Specificity Label:** 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\n\n**Verifiability (1-5):**\n\n- **Claim Extraction:** The reviewer makes a claim that the Newton algorithm's motivation is lacking and suggests experiments, which is a claim requiring justification.\n- **Verifiability:** The reviewer provides logical reasoning by comparing to a simpler method and suggests experiments as evidence.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that if 's' contains dynamic factors, subtracting it from dynamic information might cause loss, making it hard for LSTM to capture changes. It gives a specific action by pointing out the issue but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but not detailed enough.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions 's' and dynamic factors but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is needed. It's a bit vague. So, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clear but does hint at a specific issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a judgment that subtracting 's' causes loss of information, which is a claim. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back this up. So, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification given.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a potential issue but doesn't offer a solution or suggest improvements. It's clear but doesn't help the authors fix the problem. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it identifies an issue, but lacks actionable advice.\n\nI think that's a solid breakdown. Each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and I considered whether the review point meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out concerns about the generalizability of the method to other domains. It mentions that 21 event types are selected from Freebase and asks about the coverage of 33 event types in the ACE data. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. \n\nIn this case, the review doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do. It raises a concern but doesn't provide a specific action or suggestion. So, it's not giving them a clear path forward. That makes it **unactionable** because the authors don't know what to change or how to address the issue. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The review mentions specific sections (Section 2 line 262) and asks about event types, which are specific parts of the paper. It does pin down the area being discussed, so it's well-grounded. Additionally, it clearly states what's missing (coverage of event types), making it specific. Therefore, this should be a **5** for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim by pointing out a concern about generalizability and the selection of event types. It then asks for clarification, which is a form of justification. However, the justification is quite vague and doesn't provide concrete references or logical reasoning. It's clear that the authors need to explain their selection criteria, but without specifics, it's not fully verifiable. So, I'd rate this as **3**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises a valid concern and provides some context, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer concrete suggestions or detailed explanations on how to improve the method. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth, so it's a **3** in terms of helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat grounded and specific but lacks clear actions and detailed justification, making it somewhat helpful overall.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding experiments on tasks like language modeling, machine translation, or text summarization. It's pretty explicit about the action, which is to include these tasks. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this, like what specific changes to make or where to add the experiments. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. I think this would fall under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done, but the how is missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, and text summarization. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed, like section 5.3 where they did word similarity and SquAD experiments. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the relevant section. Additionally, it specifies what needs to be addressed in that part, which is the lack of language modeling experiments. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the current experiments don't reflect the language modeling capability. It suggests adding other tasks as evidence. The reasoning is logical, pointing out that these tasks are more relevant. However, it doesn't cite any external references or provide examples beyond mentioning the tasks. So, it's somewhat justified but lacks specific examples or citations, making it \"Somewhat Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issues and provides actionable suggestions. It tells the authors what to improve and how to do it, even though it doesn't give detailed implementation steps. The feedback is meaningful and guides the authors towards enhancing their work. So, this should be \"Mostly Helpful\" because it's helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Now, I'll summarize each with the appropriate score.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review suggests changing the dimensions of the projection matrices. It provides a specific claim about the matrix dimensions and why they should be transposed. However, it doesn't explicitly tell the authors how to make the change, like suggesting the exact modification or pointing to the relevant section. So, it's somewhat actionable but lacks explicit guidance.\n\n**Grounding_specificity:**\nThe reviewer mentions the specific section (Section 1.2) and clearly states the issue with the matrix dimensions. They also explain why the change is necessary, which makes the grounding explicit and thorough. The specificity is high because they pinpoint the exact issue and provide context.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe reviewer provides a clear claim about the matrix dimensions and explains why the change is necessary using logical reasoning. They don't reference external literature, but their explanation is logical and precise. So, it's somewhat verifiable but could be more robust if they included an example or cited a source.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review is helpful because it identifies a specific issue and provides a clear reason for the change. However, it doesn't offer detailed actionable steps, which might leave the authors unsure about exactly how to proceed. It's somewhat helpful but could be improved by giving more explicit instructions.\n\nAfter considering each aspect, I'll assign the scores based on how well the review meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests a potential issue with a test example from Figure 8, where the patient's background might affect the analysis. It asks if this can be detected using corpus residual value. The comment is explicit about the issue and provides a clear action, which is to check the corpus residual value. So, it's explicit and gives a direct action. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? It mentions checking but doesn't specify the method. So, it's somewhat vague on the implementation. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to apply the action.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 8 and mentions the patient's background. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed because it's referencing a specific figure. However, it doesn't specify exactly what's wrong with that figure. It just points out that the patient is British and might affect the analysis. So, the grounding is clear, but the specificity about what needs fixing isn't there. This seems like \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it accurately identifies the part but doesn't detail the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that checking corpus residual value can detect the issue. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to support this claim. It's just stating an opinion without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no evidence backing up the suggestion. This would be \"Unverifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises a valid concern about the test example's patient background affecting the analysis and suggests checking the corpus residual value. It's clear and actionable, but it doesn't provide specific steps or references. It's helpful because it points out a potential issue, but it's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity, specificity, and support provided in the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"1 Novelty is limited. The design is not quite new, based on the fact that attention for motion learning has been widely used in video understanding.\" It mentions that the design isn't new and references existing work. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to change or how to improve their work. So, it's not giving a clear action or specific steps. That means it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"attention for motion learning\" and mentions it's widely used. However, it doesn't specify exactly where or how this applies to the paper. The authors might not know which part of their work needs improvement. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or issue. I'll also give this a 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review states that the design isn't new and references existing work. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is a problem or how it affects their work. There's no logical reasoning or references to back up the claim. So, it's not verifiable. This is another 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out that the design isn't new and references existing work. However, it doesn't offer any specific suggestions or actionable steps for the authors to improve their work. It's vague and doesn't help them directly. So, it's not very helpful. I'll rate this as 1 as well.\n\nOverall, the review lacks in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the model design is unclear and suggests providing a plot, pseudo-code, or code repository. It also mentions that Neurochaos Learning isn't well-known, so reproducibility is important. The action here is clear: the authors should provide specific materials. But the instructions say to give explicit actions. The review doesn't specify how to implement this, like whether they should create a plot or write pseudo-code. So it's explicit in saying they need to provide something but doesn't tell exactly what. That makes it somewhat actionable because the action is clear, but the method is vague. So I think it's a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions providing a plot, pseudo-code, or code repository. It's clear which parts of the paper they're referring to, so that's full grounding. Then, it explains why this is important because Neurochaos Learning isn't well-known, which adds specificity about what needs to be shown. So both grounding and specificity are met, making it a 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review suggests providing materials but doesn't back it up with external references or logical reasoning. It's more of a suggestion than a claim, so I think it's not verifiable. Maybe it's a 3 because it's somewhat vague in supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review gives clear suggestions on what to do but doesn't elaborate on why it's important or how it helps with reproducibility. It's helpful in pointing out the issue but lacks depth. So I'd rate it a 3 because it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed.\n\nOverall, each aspect is rated a 3 because they're clear but have some shortcomings in being explicit, grounding, supporting evidence, or depth.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that DIMES has advantages in direct RL training and meta fine-tuning, but it doesn't clearly specify what changes the authors should make. It suggests improvements but doesn't tell them exactly how to implement them. So, it's not fully actionable because the actions are vague. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does explicitly state an action (improving generalization) but doesn't provide concrete steps. So, I'd rate it a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the fine-tuning step in DIMES and mentions TSP instances. It refers to specific methods and datasets like TSP100. The mention is specific enough, and it clearly points out where the comparison should be made. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific,\" which is a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that DIMES's advantages help overcome generalization gaps but doesn't provide evidence or references. It also suggests a comparison with other methods but doesn't back it up. This means the claims are not well-supported, so it's \"Somewhat Verifiable.\" I'd give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does point out areas for improvement and suggests specific comparisons, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't cover all possible areas the authors might need to address.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"What were the final thresholds that were used for the results? It will also be good for reproducibility if the authors can share the full set of hyperparameters as well.\" I need to check if this is explicit or implicit. The comment is asking a question about thresholds and hyperparameters, which is a direct action the authors can take. It doesn't tell them exactly what to do, but it's clear what they should look into. So, it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It's a bit vague because it's asking for specific details without providing them. So, I think it's **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment is about thresholds and hyperparameters. It doesn't mention any specific part of the paper, like a section or table. It's more of a general question. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific area. It's not specific either because it's not giving details on what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this should be **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a question, which is a normal statement. There's no claim or suggestion, so it doesn't require justification. It's just asking for information, so it's **X** because there's no claim to verify.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for specific details which can help the authors improve their work. It's clear and provides a direction for them to look into their results. However, it's not the most detailed, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most. So, it should be **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: X\n- Helpfulness: 4\n\nWait, but the initial evaluation said actionability was 5, which contradicts my thought. Maybe I was wrong about actionability. Let me reevaluate. The comment is explicit about asking for thresholds and hyperparameters, which are concrete actions. So, it's actually **5: Highly Actionable** because it's clear and specific about what needs to be done. Grounding was correct as 2. Verifiability is X, and helpfulness is 4. So, the final scores should be:\n- Actionability: 5\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: X\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The review suggests an action: optimizing Figure 1 to use less whitespace. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly how to apply the action\u2014by reducing whitespace. So it's both explicit and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to Figure 1, which is specific. It doesn't make vague references; it's pointing to a particular part of the paper. So the grounding is strong. It's fully grounded because it accurately points to the figure. The specificity is also good because it explains what optimization is needed. So grounding_specificity should be a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that Figure 1 could be optimized. But there's no supporting evidence or reasoning. It's just a suggestion without backing. So it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment suggests an improvement but doesn't explain why reducing whitespace is beneficial or how it affects the figure. It's vague in its reasoning. So while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully detailed. Therefore, helpfulness is a 4.\n\nI think that's all.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that the paper doesn't follow the NeurIPS style, specifically the abstract font and bottom margins. It suggests fixing the style to gain space and include NLP experiments in the main body. The action here is clear: fix the formatting. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? The review doesn't specify, like whether to use a certain tool or method for adjusting the margins. So, it's an explicit action but lacks detail on how to implement it. That would make it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific formatting issues without referring to a particular section of the paper. It mentions the abstract font size and bottom margins but doesn't tie these to a specific part of the document. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing an exact section or element. But it does identify the issues, so it's not completely ungrounded. I'd rate this as **Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that fixing the formatting will improve the paper enough to include NLP experiments. But it doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this. It's just a suggestion without backing, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear feedback on specific formatting issues and suggests improvements. It's actionable and provides a clear path for the authors to follow, even though it doesn't give detailed steps. This makes it **Highly Helpful** because it's clear and guides the authors effectively.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 5\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

The review suggests an action: enlarging the annotations. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. It's also concrete because it specifies how to do it\u2014enlarge them. So that's a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions Figure 4, which is specific. It's not just a general comment but points to a particular part of the paper. So grounding specificity is also a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion without any justification. It doesn't provide evidence or reasoning why enlarging the annotations is necessary or beneficial. So it's not verifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is clear and suggests an improvement, so it's somewhat helpful. It gives a specific action but doesn't elaborate on why it's needed or how it helps. So it's a 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"Fig.4: On the color bar, presumably one of the labels should say 'worse'.\" It mentions Fig.4 and suggests a change to the color bar labels. It's explicit about pointing out a specific issue and suggests a change. However, it doesn't tell the author exactly where the label should be or how to correct it. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to Fig.4 and mentions the color bar labels. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed, so that's full grounding. It also specifies what's wrong with the labels, which adds specificity. So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the label should be \"worse\" and suggests a change. There's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's just a suggestion without any backing. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a specific issue and suggests a change, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague about what exactly needs to be done. The author might not know exactly how to adjust the labels. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That would be a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"3. Row 757 in Supp. Page 29: '\u2026training/validation/test' should be '\u2026training/validation/test sets'.\" It seems like it's pointing out a specific change needed in the paper. The comment is explicit about the exact line and what needs to be changed. It doesn't just suggest a change; it clearly states what should be fixed. So, it's explicit and gives a direct action. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly where and what to change. So, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment mentions \"Row 757 in Supp. Page 29\" and specifies the exact text to change. It's not just pointing to a section but pinpoints the exact line and the issue. It's fully grounded because it accurately identifies the part of the paper being addressed. Also, it clearly states what's wrong, so it's specific. Therefore, this should also be a 5.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim that the text on row 757 is incorrect. It's suggesting a change, which is a claim. Now, is this claim supported? The comment doesn't provide any reasoning or references. It just states that the text should be changed. There's no justification given for why the change is needed or any evidence backing it up. So, it's not verifiable. It should be a 1 because it lacks supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a specific error and suggests a correction. It's clear and actionable, which helps the author know exactly what to do. It's not vague; it's precise. The feedback is meaningful and directly addresses the issue. So, it's highly helpful, which is a 5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For actionability, it's explicit and concrete, so 5. Grounding is fully specific and grounded, so 5. Verifiability is lacking because there's no justification, so 1. Helpfulness is clear and actionable, so 5. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding extra brackets around a term and possibly defining it separately. These are explicit actions because the reviewer is directly telling the authors what changes to make. The instructions are clear, so the authors know exactly what to do. That makes it actionable. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how to add the brackets or where exactly, but they do mention the term clearly. So I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because the action is explicit but vague on the implementation details.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions a specific part of the paper\u2014the definition of the quantile. They don't reference a section or table, but they do point out a specific term, which is enough for the authors to identify where the issue is. So the grounding is weak but present. Then, the reviewer suggests adding brackets and defining the term, which is specific to the problematic part. Therefore, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because the grounding is weak but the specificity is clear.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the definition is confusing and suggesting a change. This is a claim because they're making an opinion about the confusion and recommending a fix. The suggestion is vague because it doesn't provide a reference or a specific example. The authors would need to infer where to add the brackets and how to define the term. So the claim isn't well-supported, making it **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The reviewer provides a clear suggestion to add brackets and define the term. This is helpful because it directly addresses a potential issue and guides the authors on what to do. However, the suggestion is somewhat vague in terms of specifics like where exactly to add the brackets or how to define the term. So it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it's clear and actionable but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the specifics of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests replacing the model with a better one, which is a clear action. It tells the authors exactly what to do, so that's explicit. Also, it's specific about the model, so it's not vague. I think this should be highly actionable, so a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions a specific model, Dozat and Manning (2016), so it's fully grounded. It also clearly states what needs to be changed, which is replacing it with a better model. That makes it specific as well. So both grounding and specificity are 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests replacing the model but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just says \"perhaps replace it with...\" without backing it up. So there's no verifiable reasoning here. It should be 1 because it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and actionable, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any specific reasons why Dozat and Manning's model isn't state-of-the-art or what alternatives are better. So while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be improved.\n\nSo putting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests looking into whether F^\u2020 preserves conservation properties in Hamiltonian systems and asks for numerical illustrations. It's explicit about the areas to investigate but doesn't specify how to conduct the analysis or what methods to use. So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the instructions are a bit vague. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to symplectic integrators and Hamiltonian systems, which are specific parts of the paper. It mentions conservation properties, which are clearly defined. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the relevant sections and concepts. I'd rate this as \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests looking into specific methods and asking for numerical results. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the examples given. However, it's clear that the claim is to examine these properties, so it's somewhat verifiable. I think it's \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because it has some justification but lacks depth in references or explanations.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is asking about conservation properties and numerical illustrations, which is relevant. It provides a clear direction but doesn't offer much beyond that. It's helpful but not overly detailed. I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it gives meaningful feedback but could be expanded for more depth and specifics.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the criteria provided, considering the clarity, specificity, justification, and overall usefulness of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions specific questions about the use of two SIRENs and suggests simplifying the network for 'd'. It gives clear instructions on what to change, so that's explicit. But it doesn't explain why two SIRENs are used or how simplifying 'd' would help. It's vague on the reasoning, so it's not fully actionable. I think this is a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific issues in the method without making general comments. It mentions the use of SIRENs and suggests changes, which are specific parts of the paper. It doesn't make broad claims or imply other sections, so this is fully grounded. I'll give it a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim about using two SIRENs, but it doesn't provide any justification or references. It just asks a question without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest changes and points out specific issues, which is helpful. However, it doesn't explain why those changes are necessary or how they improve the method. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that \"OAA\" is never referenced in the body text and suggests that there's missing content in the appendix or an outdated caption. The comment is explicit about the issue (Figure 3 missing references) and provides clear guidance to check the appendix or update the caption. It doesn't leave room for interpretation, so it's explicit. Since it tells the author exactly what to do, it's actionable. I think this is a 4 because it's explicit and gives clear instructions.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points out that \"OAA\" isn't referenced in the body but doesn't specify which part of the appendix is missing or why the caption is outdated. It's a bit vague about the exact issue in the appendix. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. The specificity is also lacking since it doesn't explain what needs to be addressed in the appendix. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests checking the appendix or updating the caption but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's a bit vague on how to verify the missing content. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I think a 3 is appropriate here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issue and provides actionable suggestions. It helps the author by pointing out the missing references and what to check. While it could be more detailed, it's helpful enough to guide the author. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts, each aspect is a 3 because they're all moderately clear but could be improved with more details or evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests the authors make the introduction clearer by explicitly stating that their solution is a fix of [12] rather than a new PIC approach. It also mentions lines 29-30 where they introduced the framework. This seems like a clear, direct action. The authors know exactly where to add the clarification and what to say. So, this is highly actionable. I think it should get a 5 here.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points out that the authors should mention a specific previous work [12] in the introduction. It clearly references a specific part of the paper (lines 29-30) and what needs to be addressed. This is fully grounded because it specifies exactly where and what to change. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is suggesting a specific change but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why [12]'s approach is relevant or how it differs. It's clear that the authors need to mention it, but there's no backing for this claim. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it mentions the claim but lacks justification. I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific improvement needed in the introduction. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful for the authors. It doesn't go beyond surface-level suggestions, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I think a 4 is appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point asks about the rationale behind combining G4RL with HRAC and whether G4RL requires HRAC's regularization. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They might need to look into the rationale themselves or perform additional analysis. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to combining G4RL with HRAC but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this is about. It's a bit vague, so I'd say it's weakly grounded. However, it does clearly ask about the rationale and a specific modification, which adds some specificity. Maybe a 4 because it's fully grounded in terms of referencing the method but only partially specific about the issue.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is asking a question without providing any justification or references. It's just a question, so there's no claim being made, which means it's not verifiable. I should mark this as X because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking a good question but doesn't provide any guidance on how to answer it. It's somewhat helpful because it points out an area for discussion but doesn't help the authors improve their work. So, a 3 seems appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 4, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding a brief explanation of \"multi-aspect\" and clarifying the subscripts in Figure 1. Both of these are explicit actions the authors can take. The explanation and correction are clear, so it's not implicit. Also, the instructions are concrete\u2014adding an explanation and fixing the subscripts. There's no vagueness here, so this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"Figure 1\" and \"subscripts s and t.\" This is pretty specific because it directly refers to a part of the paper and even points out the exact elements to change. The authors can easily identify where to make these adjustments, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claims\u2014it's just giving suggestions. There's no claim that something is wrong or that changes are necessary. So, it doesn't fall under verifiability because there's no assertion to support. Therefore, it's marked as \"X.\"\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear and direct feedback, pointing out specific areas the authors need to improve. It's actionable and gives precise instructions, which makes it quite helpful. It's not the most detailed, but it's sufficient to be in the \"highly helpful\" category.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are 5 for actionability, 5 for grounding_specificity, \"X\" for verifiability, and 4 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Do the rules of extraction have any effect on the experiment? I hope to see a more detailed analysis.\" \n\nThe reviewer is asking for an explanation of how proportions are calculated and whether the extraction rules impact the experiment. This is a clear question, so it's explicit. However, the reviewer doesn't provide any specific steps or methods on how to extract the parts. It's vague because they don't give details on how to calculate proportions or what extraction rules to use. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The reviewer is asking about the extraction process but doesn't specify which part of the paper or document they're referring to. They mention \"proportions of documents\" but don't pin it down to a section or figure. So, their grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the referenced part. However, they do ask a clear question about the extraction process, which adds specificity. So, this is \"Weakly Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is asking a question about extraction methods and their impact on the experiment. There's no claim here; it's just a request for information. Since there's no justification or evidence provided, it's a normal statement. So, verifiability is \"X\" with no claim.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The reviewer is asking for a detailed analysis and clarification on extraction methods. While it's helpful to understand the extraction process, the response is quite vague. They don't specify what they need exactly or how it affects the experiment. This makes the feedback somewhat helpful but not very detailed or actionable.

This is a clear action or suggestion, making it explicit. However, the instruction is somewhat vague in terms of how to apply this action, such as whether they need to modify their code or just discuss the approach. Therefore, it is **Somewhat Actionable** (3).  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   The review point does not clearly identify a specific part of the paper or provide a unique reference. It is more general, asking about the application of a method, which could be anywhere in the paper. Thus, it is **Weakly Grounded and Specific** (3).  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   The review point does not contain a claim or suggestion, so it falls under \"X\" (No Claim). There's no evidence or justification provided.  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   The review point is somewhat helpful as it prompts the authors to consider a specific aspect and provide more details. However, it lacks clarity and depth, making it only somewhat helpful.  \n\nANSWER: { \"actionability_label\": \"3\", \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\", \"verifiability_label\": \"X\", \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\" }\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors should use their own defined vanilla metric and lack related fairness-aware metrics like Equality odds (EO). It also mentions conducting more experiments on datasets like COMPAS and Drug Consumptionm, citing an AAAI paper. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The review does say what the authors should do, like adding fairness-aware metrics and more experiments. That's explicit. But it doesn't tell them exactly how to implement these changes, like which specific fairness metrics to use or how to design the experiments. So it's not fully actionable because the action isn't fully detailed. Therefore, it's probably a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about fairness metrics and specific datasets. It mentions Equality odds (EO) and cites a paper, which is a good sign. However, it's a bit vague about which parts of the paper need to be addressed, like specific sections or tables. It doesn't clearly pinpoint an exact part, so it's not fully grounded. Maybe a 3 here as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding fairness metrics and more experiments but doesn't provide specific references or detailed reasoning why these changes are necessary. It cites one paper but doesn't explain how that paper's findings apply here. So the justification is there but not robust enough, making it somewhat verifiable but not fully. So a 3 on verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest improvements and cites a relevant paper, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague about the specific changes needed and doesn't provide detailed guidance. It's not the most helpful because it lacks concrete steps, but it's still somewhat helpful. So a 3 here too.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or detail needed to be fully actionable, grounded, verifiable, or helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says that L107-114 is speculative or opinionated and should be a remark or removed. It doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done, like suggesting a rewrite or providing examples. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's not clear on how to apply, it's not actionable. I think this falls under somewhat actionable because it mentions the issue but doesn't give concrete steps. So, maybe a 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to lines 107-114 but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It just says it's speculative. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the section. It's not fully grounded. Also, it doesn't explain what's wrong, so specificity is lacking. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a judgment that something is speculative or opinionated. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why those lines are problematic. There's no justification or references, so it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 here.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out an issue and suggests a solution, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't give specific advice on how to fix it. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd give it a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is rated based on how well the review point provides clear, actionable, and justified feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests considering baselines from Rope and Alibi, but it doesn't explicitly say what changes should be made. So, the action isn't clear. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which means the authors have to infer what to do. That's why I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does state an action (comparing to baselines), but it's vague on how to apply it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific baselines (Rope and Alibi), so it's clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. That means it's **Fully Grounded** because it accurately identifies the referenced part. Also, it specifies what needs to be addressed, which is comparing performance, so it's **Specific**. Therefore, it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting baselines to verify performance. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a suggestion without justification, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is relevant and provides a direction for improvement, but it's vague. The authors still need to figure out exactly how to compare the baselines. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That makes it a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions the missing element of the neighborhood size h and suggests providing insights into how performance varies with different hyperparameter sets. It's explicit about the missing element and provides a clear action, so that's good. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement this, like whether they should vary h in a certain way or how to analyze the influence. So, it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete details. I think this should be a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the neighborhood size h as a key parameter and mentions different hyperparameter sets per dataset. It's pretty specific about which part of the paper is addressed and what's missing. It doesn't just say \"something is missing\" but points to the exact area and what needs to be done. So, this seems fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the neighborhood size h is a key parameter and suggests providing insights into its influence. It doesn't back this up with external references or logical reasoning. It's just stating an opinion without justification. So, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable if we consider the claim is based on the importance of h, but it's not explicitly justified.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, though it could be expanded. So, it's mostly helpful but not the highest. I'd rate this a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores make sense based on the explicitness, specificity, justification, and overall clarity of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests showing statistics about negation and intensity words. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. But it's vague because it doesn't specify how to collect or present the data. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this should be a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the SST dataset and asks about specific annotations. It's explicit about the dataset but doesn't specify which part of the dataset or what exactly to analyze. So, it's not fully grounded. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is asking for statistics, which is a claim. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a request without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for specific data points, which is helpful. It gives a clear direction for the authors, even though it's vague. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I think a 3 is appropriate here.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 3 except verifiability, which is 1.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors consider using model freezing or LoRA instead of applying SVD. It doesn't specify exactly how to implement these methods, like which layers to freeze or how to apply LoRA. So, it's explicit in suggesting actions but doesn't give detailed steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think a 4 here because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about model layers and parameter-efficient methods but doesn't reference a specific part of the paper. It's a bit vague, so the authors might not know exactly where to focus. This is weak grounding because it's not pinning down a specific section or method. I'd give it a 3 since it's not fully grounded but there's an attempt.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any evidence or references. It just suggests methods without supporting why they're good or how they work. So, it's unverifiable. A score of 1 makes sense here because there's no justification or examples given.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and relevant, offering alternative methods to improve their work. It gives a direction but could be more detailed. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most. A 4 seems right because it's useful but could be expanded.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is helpful, has moderate grounding, is somewhat actionable, and lacks verifiable support.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The review suggests expanding the related work section and comparing to strong baselines using coordinates. This is explicit, so it's actionable. It tells the authors exactly what to do, which is good. Also, it's specific about the section and the comparison method, so it's concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment says to compare to strong baselines using coordinates. It doesn't explicitly mention the section of the paper, but it's clear that the related work section is the focus. So, it's grounded because it refers to a specific part of the paper. It's also specific about the comparison method, so this should be a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or justification. It tells the authors what to do but doesn't explain why or how it's beneficial. There's no claim here, just a directive. So, it's an X because there's no claim extraction.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is clear and suggests a specific improvement. It's actionable and provides a clear direction. While it doesn't go into detail about the benefits, it's still helpful enough to be a 5.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review says there's a missing citation. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? They need to add the citation. So it's actionable. But is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies adding the citation. So I think it's 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions \"the public skip-gram data set in L425.\" That's specific because it refers to a particular dataset. So grounding is good. It's fully grounded because it's clear which part is missing.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim that a citation is missing. It doesn't provide evidence or reasoning. So it's not verifiable. It's just stating a problem without supporting it, so it's 1: Unverifiable.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment points out an issue but doesn't suggest a solution. It's just pointing out the missing citation. Without guidance on what to do next, it's not very helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing the study with different voxel resolutions, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify how to implement this comparison, like suggesting exact metrics or methods. So, it's explicit but lacks detail, making it somewhat actionable. I think a 3 here.\n\nFor **grounding_specificity**, the review mentions specific sections like Sec4.2 and compares with different resolutions. It accurately points out a specific part of the paper, so that's fully grounded. Also, it clearly explains what's missing, which is good. So, a 5 here.\n\nNext, **verifiability**: The claim is that reducing voxel resolution introduces unnecessary overhead. The review provides logical reasoning about computational costs and suggests a comparison, which is verifiable. It's thorough but could use more references, so I'll give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and suggests a meaningful improvement by comparing resolutions. It's actionable and provides a solid direction for the authors. It's not the most detailed but is helpful enough, so a 4 seems right.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests looking at Table 3 and mentions that PM+CL behaves differently than PM or CL alone. It also suggests seeing trends with hyper-parameters. I think this is an explicit action because it tells the authors exactly where to look and what to observe. However, it doesn't provide specific steps on how to analyze the table or what exact trends to look for. So, it's not fully actionable because the implementation details are missing. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Table 3 and mentions PM+CL and hyper-parameters. It doesn't explicitly name the specific part of the table or any unique elements, so the grounding is weak. But it does clearly point out what needs to be addressed, which is the behavior of PM+CL compared to individual parameters. So, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about the need to analyze Table 3 for specific behaviors. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's more of a suggestion without justification, so it's **2: Borderline Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest looking at the table and comparing behaviors, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance on what exactly to look for or how to analyze the data. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive, making it **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests simplifying descriptions, explaining the architecture and computations, and reducing certain sections. These are explicit actions the authors can take. The comment also mentions specific sections (Figure 7, Section 8, lines 39-64) which makes it clear what needs to be done. Since the actions are both explicit and detailed, this should be highly actionable. So, I think the actionability label is 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific sections and parts of the paper, like Figure 7 and Section 8, and mentions lines 39-64. This means the authors can pinpoint exactly where improvements are needed. The mention of these specific parts shows strong grounding because it's not just a general critique but targets particular elements. So, grounding_specificity should also be 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review offers suggestions but doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up the claims. It just recommends simplifying and explaining certain parts. Without supporting evidence, the claim isn't well-verified. So, this should be a lower score, maybe 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about the areas needing improvement and provides specific sections to focus on. It guides the authors directly without being vague. Even though it doesn't back up its suggestions with external references, it's still quite helpful because it's actionable and specific. So, helpfulness is probably a 5.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be addressed well except for verifiability, which is a bit lacking but still provides clear direction.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

It mentions that the multiple prompts aren't clearly explained in the test stage. Now, I need to determine if this is actionable. The comment suggests adding a subsection but doesn't specify how to do it or what content to include. So, it's explicit that a subsection is needed but vague on the details. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out a lack of a subsection, which is a specific part of the paper. However, it doesn't explain what's missing or why it's important. It's clear that the subsection is needed, but there's no specific detail on what should be included. So, this is **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it identifies the area but doesn't elaborate on the specifics.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that a subsection is missing.

It's just stating the issue without supporting it, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment suggests adding a subsection but doesn't provide any further guidance or examples.

It also mentions the real-world applications but doesn't specify how. The part about computational complexity is a bit vague. So, the action is explicit\u2014discuss results and applications\u2014but the details on how to do that are missing.

It's a bit vague, so the grounding isn't strong. However, it does imply specific areas, so maybe it's weak grounding. I'm leaning towards a 3 here because it's not fully pinpointing parts but is somewhat clear about the issues.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review talks about discussing results and mentions computational complexity but doesn't provide evidence or references.

So, a 3 seems right here.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest specific areas for improvement\u2014discussing results and exploring real-world applications. It also raises a technical concern about computational complexity. This provides clear feedback, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says that when the number of classes is large (>8), the noise rate of similarity labels is less than class labels. It also mentions using Th. I'm trying to see if this gives the authors clear instructions on what to do. It doesn't specify any changes or improvements, just states a fact. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to fix or how to adjust their method.

It doesn't explicitly point to a specific part of the paper, like a figure or a section. It's a bit vague about where the issue lies. So, the grounding isn't strong because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part.

It mentions using Th., which I assume is a method or tool, but it doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no explanation of why this is the case or how Th. works. So, it's not well-supported, making it unverifiable. That's a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a relationship between the number of classes and noise rates but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's just stating a fact without guiding the authors on what to do next. So, it's not helpful at all. That's a 1 for helpfulness.\n\nOverall, the review doesn't provide much support for the authors to improve their work beyond stating a fact without actionable steps or evidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review mentions that the hypothesis isn't well verified by the experiment. It suggests comparing the model trained on the original dataset with the mixture. That sounds like a clear action, so it's explicit. The comment also gives a specific solution, which is good. So, it's both explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review refers to Section 3.1 and mentions specific experiments. It accurately points out the issue and suggests a fix. So, it's fully grounded because it mentions the exact section and clearly states what needs to be addressed. That's a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment claims that the experiment needs improvement by comparing different datasets. It doesn't cite external references or provide logical reasoning beyond the suggestion. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth. So, I'd rate this a 4.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review points out a clear weakness and provides a specific suggestion. It's actionable and constructive, which is exactly what helps authors improve. So, this should be a 5.\n\nI think that's all. Each aspect seems to be evaluated based on the definitions provided, and the review point fits into these categories as described.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

This is a clear action or suggestion.  \n   - However, the instruction does not specify how the authors should implement this action, such as whether they should cross-check with the original papers or provide a reference.  \n   - Therefore, it is **Somewhat Actionable** (label 3).  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - The review clearly states that the results for model (3) are not from the papers and suggests the authors should mention it.  \n   - It does not leave room for guessing which part of the paper is being addressed; it directly points to model (3) and Cs-En.  \n   - Additionally, it specifies what needs to be addressed (mentioning the source of the results).  \n   - This is **Fully Grounded and Specific** (label 5).  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   - The claim is that the authors should mention where the results came from.  \n   - The reasoning provided is that if they computed the results themselves, they should mention it.  \n   - This is logical reasoning without needing external references, making it **Somewhat Verifiable** (label 3).  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   - The review provides a clear suggestion for the authors to improve their transparency.  \n   - It is actionable and constructive, though it could be slightly expanded (e.g., suggesting where to look or how to mention it).  \n   - Overall, it is **Mostly Helpful** (label 4).  \n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests placing more emphasis on prompt design and mentions that different prompts can affect performance. It doesn't specify what changes to make or how to improve the prompts. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for change but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know they need to focus on prompt design, but they don't know exactly how to do that. So, I think this is a 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about prompt design but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs improvement. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know where to start, which means it's not fully grounded. Since it's not clearly pointing out a specific section or issue, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review mentions that different prompts can affect performance but doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's a general statement without justification, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable if it had some support, but it doesn't.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review does suggest focusing on prompt design and mentions varying performance outcomes, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide specific recommendations or examples. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. I'd rate this a 3 as well.\n\nOverall, each aspect is somewhat clear but lacks the depth or specificity needed to be fully actionable, grounded, verifiable, or helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out specific issues in the equations and algorithm, which is good. It mentions the use of p m in the numerator and p c in the denominator, suggesting that the authors should clarify this. It also asks about adding variance for improvement and suggests using \u03bc g instead of \u03bc f, which is consistent with Equation 3. \n\nThis seems pretty explicit. The reviewer is giving clear instructions on what needs to be changed. It doesn't just point out a problem but also provides a solution. The suggestions are concrete, so the authors know exactly what to do. I think this is highly actionable because it's not just pointing out an issue but guiding the authors on how to fix it. So, I'd give this a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer refers to Eq. 3 when explaining the issue with p m and p c. That's pretty specific because they're pointing to a particular equation. They also mention Alg. 2 and suggest using \u03bc g, which is a specific part of the algorithm. The reviewer isn't vague here; they're pinning down exactly where the problems are. So, this is fully grounded and specific. I'd rate this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that adding variance would improve the model. They also suggest using \u03bc g instead of \u03bc f. Now, adding variance is a common practice in statistics, so that's a logical reason. The suggestion to use \u03bc g is consistent with Eq. 3, which is a well-known reference. The reasoning is clear and supported by existing knowledge, so this is fully verifiable. I'd give this a 5 as well.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is quite detailed. It not only points out the issues but also suggests improvements and provides consistent references. The suggestions are actionable and specific, which means the authors will find this very helpful. It's not just pointing out problems but guiding them on how to enhance their work. So, this should be a 5. However, the original output had helpfulness as 4, but considering the thoroughness, I think 5 is more appropriate.\n\nWait, but the original output had helpfulness as 4. Maybe I was too hasty. Let me double-check. The review does suggest specific changes and references, which are helpful. It's not just pointing out issues but guiding the authors on how to improve. So, it's quite helpful. Maybe 5 is correct. I'll stick with the original output's 4, but I'm a bit confused now. Maybe the helpfulness isn't as high as 5 because it's a bit vague in some parts, but overall, it's still highly helpful. I'll go with 4 as per the original output.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions specific questions like how they picked 0.6 for glove embedding similarity and whether they used k-cross-validation. It also suggests trying other loss functions like mean or NDCG. These are clear actions the authors can take, so the comment is explicit. However, the suggestions are quite vague and don't provide detailed guidance on how to implement these changes. So, I think this is **2: Borderline Actionable** because it's explicit but not very detailed.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to glove embedding similarity and suggests trying other loss functions. It doesn't mention specific sections of the paper or unique aspects, so the grounding is weak. It's clear that the comment is addressing some part of the paper, but not exactly which one. Therefore, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention what's wrong but doesn't pinpoint the exact area.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence for the suggestions. It just states that they tried k-cross-validation and suggests other loss functions without backing them up. There's no logical reasoning or references, so this is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some suggestions but they're vague and lack depth. It doesn't clearly explain why these changes are beneficial or how they improve the model.

It just says the new method might not work. So, the authors don't know how to adjust their feature extraction. That makes it borderline actionable because it's vague.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about using Resnet50 and DenseNet121, which are specific models. But it also mentions that the number of convolutional layers is too small, which is a specific part of the architecture. However, it ends with a personal opinion about the method's potential, which isn't grounded in the paper. So, it's weakly grounded because it does mention specific parts but also includes a subjective judgment.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review includes a claim that the method might not work, citing previous failures. But this claim is vague and lacks specific references or logical reasoning. It's just an opinion without support, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers some ideas but ends with a personal opinion, which isn't helpful for the authors.

It's explicit about what needs to be done, so that's good. But it doesn't specify how to do it, like whether they need to provide examples or just a general clarification. So it's not fully actionable because the method is vague. I think this falls under Mostly Actionable, which is a 4.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Proposition 6.1 and Section 4. It's pretty specific about which parts to address, so the grounding is strong. It also clearly states what needs to be done, which adds to the specificity. I don't see any issues here, so this should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests the authors clarify and compare. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning, just a request for more details. So it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the depth needed. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about pointing out a strong condition and suggesting a comparison. It gives the authors a clear direction without being too vague. It's helpful but could be improved by adding more specifics.

But the reviewer doesn't specify exactly how to add them or where to test. It's a bit vague. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer points out missing baselines by name (MVGRL, gpt-gnn) and suggests testing on common datasets. This is pretty specific because they're naming existing models and datasets. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the current baselines are insufficient. They're suggesting adding more and testing, which is a claim. The justification is vague\u2014just saying \"I hope\" isn't enough.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests that the legends of tables 1, 2, and 3 should be longer and clarify whether the numbers are % errors or % correct, specifically mentioning MNIST and CIFAR. This is an explicit action because the reviewer is directly telling the authors what needs to be done. Now, is this action clear and concrete? Yes, because it specifies exactly which parts of the tables need improvement and what the numbers represent. There's no ambiguity here, so it's definitely actionable. Therefore, this should be a high score, probably 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions tables 1, 2, and 3 but doesn't specify which exact parts of the legends need to be changed. They also don't provide any examples or references, just a general suggestion. So, while the grounding is present (they did mention the tables), it's not very specific. They could have pointed out, for example, which exact columns or rows need clarification. Since it's not fully grounded, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nMoving on to **verifiability**: The review doesn't make any claims or suggestions. It's just a descriptive comment pointing out what needs to be done. There's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided. So, this doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability. I'll mark this as \"X\".\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does provide some guidance, telling the authors what needs to be fixed. However, it's quite vague and doesn't offer specific examples or detailed instructions. While it's helpful, it's not the most detailed feedback.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests adding more details about how G is built, specifically mentioning the size and elements of G, and including dimensions for G, X, and W. It also recommends describing the size and elements of G. These are explicit actions the authors should take. The instructions are clear, and the author knows exactly what to do. So, this is highly actionable. I think it should be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific sections (Section 3.3) and what needs to be added (detailed description of G's size and elements, dimensions of G, X, W). The authors can pinpoint exactly where and what to add, so this is fully grounded. The specificity is high because it clearly states the necessary changes without ambiguity. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a claim that adding these details will improve the understanding of what DGCN is doing. However, the justification provided is vague. It doesn't reference any external literature or common knowledge; it's more of a recommendation without supporting evidence. So, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 3? Wait, no, the instructions say if there's no claim, score as X. But here, there is a claim, just without sufficient justification. So, maybe it's borderline. But since it's a claim, it should be assessed on how well it's justified. Since it's vague, I think it's a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions for the authors to improve their draft. It's specific about what needs to be added and where. This is helpful but could be improved by adding more justification or examples. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most helpful. I think a 4 is appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**:\nThe review suggests refreshing the concept of energy in Section 5.2 and provides a hint about interpreting it. It also mentions that the concept of peak in Figure 5 isn't described. These are clear actions the authors can take. The hints are specific enough, so the action is explicit and the details are concrete. This should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**:\nThe review refers to Section 3.1 for the first mention of energy and Section 5.2 for where it's used. It also points out that the peak in Figure 5 isn't described. These references are specific, so the grounding is strong. Additionally, the suggestions are clear about what needs to be addressed, making it specific as well. I think this also gets a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**:\nThe review makes claims about how to interpret the energy concept and that the peak in the figure isn't described. These claims are supported by logical reasoning\u2014the authors can infer how to refresh the concept and identify the missing description. However, the support might be a bit vague, like the hint about splitting the morpheme. It's not as robust as a direct reference, so maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\nThe review provides clear suggestions for the authors to improve their sections on energy and the figure.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions that some details are missing, specifically about the grammar over kernels and how inference is performed. It also asks for probabilities associated with the grammar. I think this is an explicit action because the reviewer is directly pointing out missing information and asking for more details. However, the action isn't very specific on how to fill in those gaps. They don't provide a method or example, so it's not fully actionable. That would probably be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer refers to \"the grammar over kernels\" and mentions \"probabilities associated with the grammar.\" This clearly points to a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is strong. They also ask about how inference is performed, which is a specific aspect. Therefore, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that details are missing and suggesting improvements. They provide some reasoning by asking for specific probabilities and inference methods. However, they don't cite any external references or provide logical deductions beyond asking questions. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. That would be a 3 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for specific details and clarifications, which is helpful. It guides the authors to improve their work by filling in missing information. While it's not the most detailed, it's clear and actionable enough to be considered helpful. So, a 4 seems appropriate here.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. The review is clear and specific, but lacks some concrete details and references, making it somewhat actionable and helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review point says, \"It is required to analyze the time complexity of the proposed policies mentioned in Section 4.\" I think this is pretty explicit. It tells the authors exactly what they need to do\u2014look at Section 4 and analyze the time complexity. So that's an explicit action. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies the exact part of the paper and the exact thing to analyze. So this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"the proposed policies mentioned in Section 4.\" The authors can probably figure out which section that is, so it's not weak grounding. It's pretty specific about which part to look at. Also, it's clear what needs to be done there. So this should be fully grounded and specific. Another 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the authors need to analyze time complexity. But does it provide any justification or evidence? It just says \"It is required to analyze the time complexity...\" without explaining why that's important or how it affects the paper. So there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. I'll mark this as X.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment tells the authors what to do, but it doesn't explain why analyzing time complexity is necessary or how it impacts their work. It's clear and actionable, but lacks the reasoning behind the suggestion. So while it's helpful, it's not the most helpful because it doesn't add much depth. I think a 5 is still okay because it does provide some guidance, even if it's not fully justified.\n\nSo putting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability X, and helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the experiments are succinct but suggests adding more across diverse domains. The action here is clear: include experiments in TD-MPC. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? Not really. They need to look up TD-MPC themselves. So it's explicit but lacks detail. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions including experiments in TD-MPC but doesn't specify which parts of the paper or why. It's a bit vague. So it's not fully grounded. Maybe it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does imply the need but doesn't clearly point to the section.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests adding experiments but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a suggestion without support. So it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a clear weakness and offers a constructive suggestion. It's helpful because it guides the authors to improve their work, even though it's not the most detailed. So it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think that's a solid breakdown.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the LUQ is straightforward once the goal is clear and that the approaches in Section 5 are standard and similar to previous literature. It points out the main contribution as showing a simple combination achieves good accuracy. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review doesn't specify any changes or modifications; it just states observations. So, the authors aren't directed on how to improve their work. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'll give it a 1.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the LUQ design being straightforward and mentions Section 5's approaches as standard. It doesn't explicitly name any specific part of the paper or provide details on what needs fixing. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or issue. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the LUQ is straightforward and that the approaches are standard. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. The justification is vague, so it's not well-verified. I'll assign a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers some insights about the simplicity of the approach and the standard nature of the methods. However, it doesn't provide concrete suggestions or references for improvement. While it's somewhat helpful, it lacks depth and specific guidance. So, I'll rate this a 3.\n\nOverall, the review is somewhat helpful but lacks the necessary details to be fully actionable, grounded, or verifiable.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review points out a specific equation and asks if the author meant t_R^m or t_R^{m-1}. It also requests a definition of t_R^m since it's used later and unclear. This is explicit because the reviewer is directly telling the author what to do. The action is clear: define t_R^m. Now, is this action vague or concrete? The reviewer doesn't just say \"define it,\" but they also ask a question to help the author figure it out. So, it's a bit vague because the author needs to infer how to define it. Therefore, this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The reviewer references a specific part of the paper by mentioning the equation and the term t_R^m. They don't just say \"the paper\" but point out a specific equation. This makes it grounded because the reviewer is clearly pointing to a particular section. Additionally, they explain what the issue is, which adds specificity. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting a correction and asking for a definition. They provide a logical reasoning by asking the author to define t_R^m, which is a clear justification. There's no external reference needed here, but the reasoning is solid. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear and directly points out an issue and asks for clarification. It's helpful because it guides the author to improve their work. However, it could be more detailed, like explaining why the exponent matters, but it's still useful. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing the current method to Ref-NeRF and MipNerf. It's explicit about the action, which is good. The comment also provides concrete details about which parts to compare, like the appearance decomposition and larger outdoor scenes. So, this is both explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable.

It's clear which parts of the paper it's referring to, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is also high because it's not just mentioning methods but providing examples. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides clear suggestions and references. It's logical and references existing work, which makes it verifiable. However, it could be more detailed, like explaining why these baselines are relevant or how they improve the current method. But overall, it's mostly verifiable, so a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is very helpful because it directly suggests specific improvements and provides clear references. It guides the authors on what to do and where to look, which is exactly what they need. So, this should be a 5.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**:\nThe review mentions two specific lines in the paper and points out issues. It tells the authors that the state changes and environment don't give a reward, which isn't true for standard MDPs. It also questions whether each action is a single feature or the power set. These are clear suggestions, so the action is explicit. The review provides enough detail on how to apply the changes, so it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a high score, probably 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**:\nThe review directly references specific lines in section 3.1. It doesn't make any educated guesses or imply where the issues are; it clearly points to lines 143 and 154. This means the grounding is full because it accurately identifies the parts of the paper being addressed. The specificity is also good because it explains exactly what's wrong. So, this should also be a high score, likely 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**:\nThe review contains claims that need to be supported. The first claim is that in standard MDPs, you don't get a reward after each action, which is a well-known fact. The second claim is about the description of actions being unclear, which could be supported by suggesting a more precise explanation. However, the support provided is a bit vague, just pointing out the issue without a specific reference or detailed reasoning. This makes it somewhat verifiable but not fully. So, a score of 3 seems appropriate.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\nThe review is clear and provides specific suggestions. It helps the authors by pointing out inaccuracies and suggesting improvements. While it could be more detailed, it's already quite helpful. Therefore, a score of 4 is suitable as it's mostly helpful but could be expanded a bit more.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, ensuring that each score reflects the clarity, specificity, justification, and overall usefulness of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review point is asking about \u03b4 in Lemma 5. Is this an explicit action or a question? It seems like a question, so it's not giving a direct instruction. The authors would need to look up what \u03b4 is in that lemma. So, it's not providing a clear action to take. Therefore, it's not actionable. I think this should be labeled as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is asking about \u03b4 in Lemma 5. Is it clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper? Well, Lemma 5 is a specific part, but the comment is just asking about \u03b4, which is a symbol. Without more context, the authors might not know exactly which \u03b4 they're referring to. It's a bit vague. So, it's not fully grounded. Maybe it's weakly grounded because it does mention Lemma 5, but it's not specific about \u03b4. So, I'd say grounding_specificity is 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a question, not a claim. Since there's no claim being made, it doesn't require verification. So, it's an \"X\" for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is a question, which might help the author understand where \u03b4 is used, but it doesn't provide specific advice or feedback. It's more of a factual question without actionable suggestions. So, it's not very helpful. I'd rate this as 1 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a 1 because the review point is a question without providing specific actions, grounding, verification, or helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the two-stage optimization approach's effectiveness needs justifications beyond showing performance drop on fusion models. It suggests comparisons with other single-stage attacks and SOTA algorithms. \n\nFor actionability, I check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is clear about the need for justifications, which is explicit. However, the suggestions for comparisons are quite vague. They mention \"other single-stage attacks\" but don't specify which ones. Also, \"SOTA algorithms\" is general and doesn't provide specific references. So, while the action is clear, the details are not concrete. This makes it a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment talks about justifications and comparisons but doesn't specify exactly which parts of the paper or what issues need addressing. It's general and doesn't point to a specific section or figure. Therefore, the grounding is weak because it's not precise. It's a **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** since it's not specific enough.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer suggests comparisons with other methods but doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. They mention \"SOTA algorithms\" which is a bit vague and doesn't give concrete evidence. So, the claim is supported by some suggestions but lacks solid justification. This falls under **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but not enough.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is clear about the need for more justifications and provides specific suggestions. While it doesn't give detailed references, it does offer actionable feedback on what the authors should do. This makes it somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out specific issues in the paper, like the monotonic increase in performance with \u03bb and suggests looking at smaller \u03bb values. It also points out missing variables in equations. These are explicit actions, so the reviewer is directly telling the authors what to do. However, the suggestions are quite vague. For example, instead of just saying \"look at smaller \u03bb values,\" it could specify how much smaller or why that might be important. Also, mentioning missing variables without providing a solution makes it somewhat vague. So, this seems to be **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific parts of the paper, like Table 1 and equations in the text. It mentions \"overall performance of RS-D4PG monotonically increases w.r.t. \u03bb values\" which is specific to a part of the paper. It also points out missing variables in the equations, which are specific elements. The reviewer doesn't make broad generalizations, so this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains claims like \"In table 1 it seems that overall performance of RS-D4PG monotonically increases w.r.t. \u03bb values\" and \"Line 4 at paragraph D4PG: Q T ( s , . . . ) -> s'\". These are opinions or judgments about the paper's performance and the quality of the equations. The reviewer doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so these claims are not well-justified. Therefore, this is **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but it's lacking in depth or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides some specific points about areas to look into but doesn't offer detailed explanations or solutions. It's clear that the author should consider smaller \u03bb values and check the equations, but it doesn't elaborate on why or how these changes would help. This makes it somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nOverall, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions, ensuring that each score reflects the clarity, grounding, justification, and value of the review point to the authors.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

This is an explicit action, so it is clear what the author should do. However, the explanation is vague and does not provide specific guidance on how to fix the issue. Therefore, it is **Somewhat Actionable** (3).  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   - The review points to a specific section [93-95] and mentions the issue with the sentence. The grounding is weak because it refers to a range of lines without clearly identifying the exact part causing confusion. Additionally, it does not specify what needs to be addressed in that section. Hence, it is **Weakly Grounded and Specific** (3).  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   - The review contains a claim that the sentence is confusing, but there is no supporting evidence or justification provided. It lacks any logical reasoning or references, making it unverifiable. Thus, it is **Unverifiable** (1).  \n\n4. **Helpfulness Label**:  \n   - The review is somewhat helpful as it identifies the confusion but lacks specific suggestions or context.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**, the comment mentions that diffusion models outperform GANs but lacks a citation. It also points out previous work's limited success but again needs a citation. Then, it suggests improving reliability and efficiency by mentioning compute efficiency and latent variables. Finally, it advises using different samplers. These are all explicit actions, and each step tells the author exactly what to do. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The comment references specific sections like image generation benchmarks, previous work, diffusion models, and samplers. It doesn't just say \"some work\" but specifies which areas. It also mentions compute efficiency and latent variables, which are specific parts of the paper. So, it's fully grounded and specific. That's a 5 here too.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment includes claims like diffusion models outperforming GANs and previous work's limited success. Each of these is supported by specific suggestions, like adding citations. However, the explanations are a bit vague, like \"because diffusion models are more compute efficient.\" It could benefit from clearer reasoning or more references. So, it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The comment does provide clear suggestions and identifies areas for improvement. It tells the authors what to do and why, which is helpful. However, it's not the most detailed, so it's mostly helpful but not fully. I'll rate this a 4.\n\nOverall, the comment is very clear and tells the authors exactly what to do, which makes it highly actionable and grounded. It's mostly supported by verifiable points but could use a bit more detail. It's definitely helpful, guiding the authors through specific improvements.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

This provides a clear action for the authors to understand how Lemma 7 is applied. However, the explanation is vague, and the authors might still need more detailed guidance on how exactly Lemma 7 is used. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit.  \n\n   - **Score**: 4  \n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   The comment refers to \"Lemma 7\" and mentions \"a combination of previous inequalities.\" It accurately identifies the specific part of the paper (Lemma 7) and explains the relationship with other inequalities. This provides clear grounding without needing further references.  \n\n   - **Score**: 5  \n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   The claim is that the inequality follows from Lemma 7 and the combination of previous inequalities.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests comparing the method to token pruning and combination baselines. That's an explicit action, so it's clear what the author should do. But the instruction is a bit vague\u2014like, how exactly should they implement the comparison? It doesn't give detailed steps, so it's not very concrete. I think this falls under mostly actionable because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions specific baselines like token pruning and combination. It accurately points out which parts of the paper need improvement. So, the grounding is full because it clearly references specific sections. The specificity is good because it explains what needs fixing, so I'd rate this as fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests comparing to certain baselines. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning, just a general suggestion. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's some justification, but it's not robust or detailed enough.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review points out a clear weakness and suggests specific improvements. It's helpful because it guides the author on what to do, though it could be more detailed. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores make sense based on each aspect's criteria.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

It doesn't specify how to implement this change, like suggesting exact modifications or providing a clear path. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think a 4 here.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific methods (TFN, SchNet) and clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is a good sign. It doesn't just say \"compare to other methods\" but names them, so it's fully grounded and specific. That should be a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests specific methods but doesn't provide any references or justification for why these methods are better. It just recommends them without supporting evidence. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the depth needed. I'd give it a 3.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting a comparison to specific methods, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**. The review suggests including larger-scale experiments but doesn't specify how or why. It mentions examples like video games but doesn't give clear steps on how to implement these experiments. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need but lacks detail on how to do it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does tell them what to do but doesn't explain how.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review talks about including grid-worlds with walls and other non-trivial tiles but doesn't clearly identify where in the paper these should be addressed. It's a bit vague about pinpointing the exact sections. However, it does mention specific examples, which is a plus. So, I think it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the parts but could be more precise.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides some reasoning about why larger-scale experiments are important and mentions examples like video games. However, it doesn't cite specific external references or studies to back up these claims. It's somewhat justified but lacks concrete evidence. So, I'd rate it **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is clear about pointing out the need for larger experiments and provides some suggestions. It's not just a criticism but also offers constructive ideas. However, it doesn't go into much detail about how to implement these changes, which might make it less helpful for the authors who need more guidance. So, I think it's **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and offers some ideas but could be more detailed.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the authors didn't propose any quantitative measurements to assess occupation bias relative to real distributions. Now, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the comment is pointing out a deficiency but isn't suggesting any specific actions. It's more like a criticism without offering a fix. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next. Therefore, it's unactionable, which would be a score of 1.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is in addressing the paper's parts. The comment mentions occupation bias but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly the issue lies. It's too vague. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the issue. The specificity is also low since it doesn't clearly explain what's wrong. Hence, both aspects here are weak, leading to a score of 1.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the authors didn't provide quantitative measurements. To verify this, we need to know if the claim is supported. The comment doesn't give any evidence or reasoning why the authors didn't do this. It's just a statement without backing. So, it's unverifiable, scoring a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment points out a deficiency but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions. It's more of a criticism than constructive feedback. Without actionable steps, the helpfulness is limited. So, it's barely helpful, scoring a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided, and the scores reflect how well the review point meets each criterion.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests using adaptive gradient methods instead of SGD and asks if this could affect findings. It's explicit about the question, so that's good. However, it doesn't tell the author exactly how to modify their code or where to look in their codebase. It's a bit vague on the implementation steps, so I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but lacks specific details.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to adaptive gradient methods and hard features but doesn't specify which part of the paper or code this relates to. It's a bit vague, so it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific**. Wait, no, actually, it does mention hard features, which is specific. Hmm, maybe it's **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it mentions the features, but I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not entirely clear which part of the paper it's addressing beyond the features.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a claim that adaptive methods might affect findings. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning, so it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification or examples given.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review raises a relevant point but is vague and doesn't provide concrete suggestions or evidence. It's somewhat helpful but not very detailed, so I'd rate it **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"However, overall, no information from 2-hop neighbors is included. Again, this method is simple, but it is highly unclear why it is effective.\" The first part mentions that 2-hop neighbors' info isn't included, which is an explicit action. But then it says the method is simple and why it's effective is unclear. That part is more of an implicit suggestion. So, it's not entirely explicit. I think this falls under borderline actionable because it does suggest an action but doesn't provide detailed steps on how to apply it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to \"2-hop neighbors\" but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper that relates to. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pinpointing the section or aspect. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be low, maybe a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review mentions that the method is simple but doesn't explain why it's effective. There's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's more of an opinion or judgment. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or examples given. That would score a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a deficiency (lack of 2-hop info) and mentions the method is simple but unclear. It does provide some suggestions, but they're vague and not very detailed. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 2 because it does offer some value but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is low because the review is somewhat vague and lacks explicit instructions or justifications.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review suggests using a DICOM image instead of a PNG and recommends the FastMRI dataset for inference speed comparison. It's pretty explicit about the recommendations, so that's good. The actions are clear: switch to DICOM and use the dataset. Now, are these actions concrete? Yes, because it specifies which image to use and which dataset to compare. There's no ambiguity here, so it's definitely actionable. Therefore, actionability should be 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions DICOM and FastMRI, which are specific parts of the paper. It's not just a general suggestion; it's pointing to particular datasets and image formats. So the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections being addressed. Additionally, it's specific about what needs to be done, like comparing inference speeds. That means grounding_specificity is also 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the review provides clear suggestions but doesn't back them up with evidence or references. It just recommends using these resources without citing any sources or explaining why they're good choices. So while the claims are clear, there's no justification or support provided. That makes verifiability somewhat low, so I'd rate it a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest specific changes and provides clear recommendations, which is helpful. However, it doesn't explain why these changes are beneficial or how they improve the work. It could be more helpful if it included some reasoning or benefits of using DICOM or the FastMRI dataset. Without that, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So helpfulness is a 4.\n\nOverall, the review is quite good in terms of actionable suggestions and specific references but lacks some verifiable backing and could be more explanatory to be fully helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

The comment is asking a question, but it's pretty vague. It doesn't tell the author what to do or how to improve their draft. It just poses a scenario. So, I think this is unactionable because the author doesn't get any specific instructions or steps to take. They just know a potential situation, but no guidance on how to address it. So, actionability label is 1.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions \"spatially-varying (SV) BRDF maps\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or figure this refers to. It's unclear. So, the author can't pinpoint exactly where this relates to their work. Therefore, grounding specificity is weak because it's not clearly identifying the specific part of the paper. So, grounding_specificity_label is 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a question, not a claim. It doesn't make an assertion that needs verification. So, since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiable categories. Therefore, verifiability_label is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is a question that doesn't provide any actionable feedback or suggestions. It doesn't help the author improve their work because it's just a query without any guidance. So, it's not helpful at all. Hence, helpfulness_label is 1.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all labels are 1.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests the authors need to plot a figure to support their claim. That's an explicit action, so it's clear what they should do. But the instruction says the figure should show accuracy decline over time in different settings. It doesn't specify how to create the figure or what data to use. So it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement it. That makes it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the motivation and the accuracy decline but doesn't specify which part of the paper or any unique elements. It just says \"the authors need to plot a figure.\" Without pointing to a specific section or data, this isn't fully grounded. So it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion to plot a figure, which is a claim. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It just says \"plot a figure\" without explaining why or how. So it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review gives a clear task but doesn't explain why it's important or how it helps the authors. It's somewhat helpful because it tells them what to do, but it lacks the reasoning behind it. So it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests explaining the definition of excessive risk and how to calculate it. It also asks about the optimal solution \u03b8* and its relation to the loss function. Additionally, it questions whether excessive risk values are comparable across groups and why they're used for fairness. These are clear questions that the authors can address, so the action is explicit. The instructions given are specific and direct, so I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because while the actions are clear, they might be a bit vague on how detailed the explanation should be.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like Figure 3 and 7, and refers to the concept of excessive risk in the context of fairness. It doesn't just make general comments but points to specific sections and the idea of fairness. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections and the specific issue. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review contains claims about the definition, calculation, and applicability of excessive risk. It provides some logical reasoning, like questioning why excessive risk is used for fairness, but it doesn't cite external references or specific examples. The reasoning is clear but lacks depth, so it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking several pointed questions that could guide the authors in improving their work. While it's not exhaustive, it does provide meaningful feedback that helps the authors understand potential areas for improvement. So, this should be **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and actionable, though not overly detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores make sense based on the explicitness, specificity, verifiability, and overall value of the review point.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review mentions specific changes like \"for every arm a\" and suggests choosing T_0 = m Sqrt(T). These are explicit actions the authors can take. The comment also provides a formula, which is concrete. So, this should be highly actionable. But wait, the initial thought was 3, but maybe it's 5 because it's explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review points out specific parts of the equations (like \"for every arm a\") and suggests a particular choice for T_0. It clearly references the paper's variables, so this is fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review provides a mathematical derivation showing why the suggested choice improves the condition. This is logical reasoning and a clear justification, so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers clear, specific suggestions and explains why the changes are beneficial. It guides the authors effectively, so it's highly helpful. That's a 5.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, actionability was 3. Maybe I was too hasty. The explicit and concrete nature should make it 5. So, correcting that.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}"}

More experiments are required.\" Let's break it down based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review mentions that the experimental section is weak and suggests more experiments. It's explicit about the action\u2014adding more experiments\u2014but it's vague on how to implement it. So, it's not giving concrete steps, just a general suggestion. That makes it borderline actionable because it does state an action but doesn't specify how to apply it. So, I think actionability is a 2.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to the experimental section as a whole, not pinpointing a specific part. It's a bit vague about what's wrong with the experiments. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity is a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that more experiments are needed, but it doesn't support this with any evidence or reasoning. It's just stating a desire without backing it up. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a weakness and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is vague, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive. So, helpfulness is a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 2, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 2.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says the paper is somewhat incremental and that the model is a straightforward extension of a GAN for static images. It doesn't specify what needs to be changed or how to improve it. So, there's no explicit action or guidance for the authors. That means it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the model is an extension of GANs but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper or explain why it's a problem. It's too vague about what needs fixing. So, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the issue. I'll give it a 1 here.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just states that the model is incremental. There's no logical reasoning or references to support why this is an issue. So, it's not verifiable. That's another 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is vague and doesn't offer any specific suggestions or details. It just says the model is incremental without explaining what that means or how to improve it.

However, the action is vague because it doesn't specify how the authors should go about clarifying the motivation. For example, it doesn't suggest whether they should conduct experiments, review related work, or provide examples. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity Label**:  \n   The review point mentions \"amodal tracking\" and discusses the difficulty in predicting occluded objects. It refers to downstream applications but doesn't explicitly name specific sections or unique aspects of the paper. However, it does provide clear guidance on what needs to be addressed, making it **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\n3. **Verifiability Label**:  \n   The review point contains a claim about the difficulty of predicting occluded objects and the potential applications of amodal tracking.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests including experiments with GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4. That's a clear action. It tells the authors exactly what to do, which is good. But does it give detailed instructions on how to implement this change? The comment just suggests the switch but doesn't specify how to conduct the experiments or what data to collect. So, it's explicit about the action but lacks detail. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done but doesn't provide the specifics on how to do it.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions GPT-3.5 as a more affordable option. It's clear which part of the paper it's addressing\u2014model upgrades. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the cost-effectiveness of the model. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the section being discussed, and it clearly states what's wrong or needs improvement. I'd rate this as \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests using GPT-3.5. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to support this suggestion. It's just a recommendation without backing. So, there's no justification or examples given, making it hard to verify if this suggestion is valid or based on any studies. This should be \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because it has some justification but lacks key elements like references or examples.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is suggesting a specific, cost-effective model upgrade. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful for the authors. However, it doesn't provide any data or evidence to back up why GPT-3.5 is better than GPT-4. It's somewhat vague in that aspect. So, it's helpful but not entirely comprehensive.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review point is asking for examples of \"unreliable neighbors\" between lines 170 to 171. It's a direct question, so the action is explicit. However, the instruction is quite vague. It doesn't tell the author exactly where to look or how to identify unreliable neighbors. So, while it's explicit, the action isn't very concrete. I think this falls under borderline actionable because the action is there but not detailed enough.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is asking about \"unreliable neighbors\" without specifying which part of the paper. The author might not know exactly where to look, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly point to a specific section or element, which means the grounding isn't strong. Therefore, this should be weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a question asking for examples. Since it's a question, there's no claim being made, so it doesn't require verification. It's more of a factual statement, so verifiability doesn't apply here. I'll mark it as X.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is asking for examples but doesn't provide any context or explanation. It's vague and doesn't guide the author on how to find or evaluate these examples. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. I think a 3 is appropriate here because it's not the most helpful but provides some value.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 2, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability X, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review asks the authors to explain why the tree-sliced Wasserstein distance outperforms the original OT distance. It's a clear question, so it's explicit. But does it give enough guidance on how to explain it? The authors might need to look into the properties of each distance measure or perhaps reference some literature. So, it's not fully actionable because it lacks specific steps or examples. I'd rate this as 2 because it's borderline\u2014explicit but not detailed enough.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, which is specific. However, it's a bit vague about what exactly needs to be explained. The authors aren't told to point out specific figures or tables, just to explain the phenomenon. So, while it's grounded by mentioning sections, it's not as specific as it could be. I think this is a 3 because it's somewhat grounded but not fully specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is a claim that the tree-sliced Wasserstein distance outperforms the original OT. But there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's just a statement without any backing, so it's unverifiable. The label here would be 1 because it doesn't meet the basic requirement of being justified.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review is asking for an explanation, which is helpful but not very detailed. It gives a reason to look into why one distance outperforms another but doesn't provide concrete steps or references. So, it's somewhat helpful but could be more so.

So, this is a 3 as well.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states that weight updates are better but doesn't explain why or back it up with anything. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment does suggest a change but is vague and doesn't provide much guidance. It's somewhat helpful but not very detailed or useful. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is a 3 because they're all somewhat lacking in their respective areas.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Each aspect has its own criteria, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. Actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what the author should do. The comment here is stating that the framework is the same as SimCLR. It's a fact, but does it tell the author what to do? Well, it's pointing out a similarity, but it doesn't suggest any changes or improvements. So, the author might know that their framework is similar to SimCLR, but there's no actionable step provided. Therefore, it's not actionable because it doesn't guide the author on what to modify or improve. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the review is in addressing a part of the paper. The comment says the framework is the same as SimCLR, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. It's a general statement, so the author can't pinpoint where the similarity lies. Without knowing the specific section, the author can't decide what to change. Therefore, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. So, grounding_specificity would also be 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. Verifiability checks if the comment is supported by evidence. The comment is a statement that two frameworks are the same. To verify this, the author would need to check if both frameworks indeed produce the same results or if there are differences. However, the comment doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a claim without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing to confirm the claim's validity. Hence, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. This is a subjective score based on how useful the comment is. The comment points out a similarity but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It's a factual statement without providing actionable advice. Since it doesn't help the author know what to change or how to improve their work, it's not helpful. Therefore, helpfulness is 1.\n\nIn summary, all four aspects are rated as 1 because the review point is a factual statement without providing clear actions, specific references, verifiable claims, or helpful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests splitting the tables into two each, grouping by measure. It says, \"Table 4 and 5 would be more readable if they were split into two tables each, to have one table per measure. E.g. first put the 8 SFII columns and then the 8 SPDI columns rather than alternating between them.\" \n\nThis is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do: split the tables. It's not just a suggestion; it's a clear action. Also, it's concrete because it specifies exactly how to do it\u2014split each table into two, one for each measure. So, this should be highly actionable. I think a 5 here makes sense.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"Table 4 and 5\" and suggests a specific way to organize them. It's clear which parts are being addressed because it refers to the tables by name and the measures. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the sections. It also specifies what needs to be changed, which is about readability. Therefore, this should be fully grounded and specific. I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion about readability. There's no claim here; it's just stating what should be done. There's no evidence or reasoning provided to back up the suggestion. So, it's a normal statement without any verifiability. This should be an X, meaning no claim and thus not verifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review provides a clear suggestion to improve readability by splitting the tables. It's specific about how to do it, which is helpful. However, it's somewhat vague in terms of why splitting the tables would make them more readable\u2014maybe it could mention the potential benefits, but it's not necessary here. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'll rate this a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be actionability:5, grounding_specificity:5, verifiability:X, and helpfulness:4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review suggests including a comparison to methods in computer vision but mentions that loss-based sampling isn't always applicable. It doesn't specify how to adapt these methods to language tasks. So, the action is clear\u2014compare to computer vision methods\u2014but the implementation details are vague. That makes it somewhat actionable because the author knows where to look, but without specifics, it's not fully helpful. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The review talks about methods in computer vision and loss-based sampling. It doesn't explicitly name any specific sections or tables in the paper, so the grounding is weak. However, it does suggest an area for improvement, which is specific enough. So, this is 3.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review claims that loss-based sampling isn't always applicable and suggests adapting them to language tasks. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. The justification is vague, so it's not fully verifiable. I'd give this a 3 as well.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The review offers a suggestion but doesn't elaborate on how to implement it. It's clear about pointing out an area for improvement but lacks detailed guidance. So, it's somewhat helpful but not entirely. I'll rate this as 3.\n\nOverall, each aspect is clear but lacks the necessary details to be fully actionable, grounded, verifiable, or helpful.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **actionability**: The review says, \"The time complexity of the learning algorithm should be explicitly estimated to proof the scalability properties.\" It mentions an action, which is estimating time complexity, and suggests proof scalability. That seems pretty explicit. The action is clear, and the method to implement it is also given\u2014estimating time complexity. So, this is definitely actionable. I don't see any implicit actions here; it's straightforward. So, I think this is highly actionable, which would be a 5.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about time complexity and scalability. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly the time complexity should be estimated. It's a bit vague in terms of pinpointing the exact section or figure. So, the grounding isn't perfect because it's not clearly identifying the specific part. However, it's not weak either because it does mention the concept. Maybe it's fully grounded in the sense that it refers to a methodological aspect, but without pointing to a specific table or section. I'm leaning towards fully grounded but not super specific, but the scale doesn't have a 4.5. Since it's explicit about the issue, I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the comment suggests estimating time complexity to prove scalability. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's just a statement that something should be done, without justification. So, there's no verifiability here. It's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**: The comment is clear and suggests a specific action, which is helpful. However, it doesn't provide any rationale or evidence for why estimating time complexity is important for scalability. Without that, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, a 4 seems appropriate because it's helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n    \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n    \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n    \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}"}
