The review point is weakly grounded and specific because the authors cannot confidently determine which part the comment addresses, but the comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed in this part. The review point is somewhat verifiable because the claim has some justification but lacks key elements (e.g., examples, references). The review point is somewhat helpful because the comment identifies weaknesses or areas for improvement but is incomplete or lacks depth. While the authors gain some insights, the feedback does not fully address their needs for improving the draft.\n"}

It is somewhat grounded and specific, as it mentions a specific aspect of the paper (the perspective of task-oriented recommendation) and provides some specific examples (works such as [] Li, Xiujun, et al. \"End-to-end task-completion neural dialogue systems.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.01008 (2017).). However, it is not fully grounded and specific, as it does not provide a clear explanation of how these works differ from other chatbox research works. The review point is somewhat verifiable, as it provides some references to relevant literature (e.g. [] He, Ji, et al. \"Deep reinforcement learning with a natural language action space.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.04636(2015).). However, it is not fully verifiable, as it does not provide a clear explanation of how these works differ from other chatbox research works. The review point is somewhat helpful, as it provides some suggestions for the authors to consider. However, it is not fully helpful, as it does not provide a clear explanation of how these works differ from other chatbox research works.\n\n###Reference:\n- [] Li, Xiujun, et al. \"End-to-end task-completion neural dialogue systems.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.01008 (2017).\n- [] He, Ji, et al. \"Deep reinforcement learning with a natural language action space.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.04636(2015).\n"}
