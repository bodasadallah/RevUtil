These aspects are aimed to maximize the utilization of the review comments for the authors. The primary purpose of the review is to help/guide authors in improving their drafts. Keep this in mind while evaluating the review point. Whenever you encounter a borderline case, think: \u201cWill this review point help authors improve their draft?\u201d. There is no correlation between the aspect score and the length of the review point.\n\nAspect: actionability\n\n**Actionability**\n\n**Definition:** Measures the level of actionability in a review point. We evaluate actionability based on two criteria:\n\n1. **Explicit vs. Implicit**:\n   - **Explicit:** Actions or suggestions that are direct or apparent. Authors can directly identify modifications they should apply to their draft. Clarification questions should be treated as explicit statements if they give a direct action.\n   - **Implicit:** Actions that need to be inferred from the comment. This includes missing parts that need to be added. Authors can deduce what needs to be done after reading the comment.\n\n2. **Concrete vs. Vague**:\n   - **Concrete:** Once the action is identified, the authors know exactly what needs to be done and how to apply the action.\n   - **Vague:** After identifying the action, the authors still don\u2019t know how to carry out this action.\n\n**Importance:** It\u2019s more important for actions to be concrete so that authors know how to apply them. It's also preferred for actions to be stated directly rather than inferred.\n\n**Actionability Scale (1-5):**\n\n1. **1: Unactionable**\n   - **Definition:** The comment lacks meaningful information to help authors improve the paper. Authors do not know what they should do after reading the comment.\n\n2. **2: Borderline Actionable**\n   - **Definition:** The comment includes an implicitly stated action or an action that can be inferred. However, the action itself is vague and lacks detail on how to apply it.\n\n3. **3: Somewhat Actionable**\n   - **Definition:** The comment explicitly states an action but is vague on how to execute it.\n\n4. **4: Mostly Actionable**\n   - **Definition:** The comment implicitly states an action but concretely states how to implement the inferred action.\n\n5. **5: Highly Actionable**\n   - **Definition:** The comment contains an explicit action and concrete details on how to implement it. Authors know exactly how to apply it.\n\nAspect: grounding_specificity\n\n\n**Grounding Specificity**  \n\n**Definition:** Measures how explicitly a review comment refers to a specific part of the paper and how clearly it identifies the issue with that part. This helps authors understand what needs revision and why. Grounding specificity has two key components:  \n\n1. **Grounding:** How well the authors can identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.  \n   - **Weak Grounding:** The author can make an educated guess but cannot precisely identify the referenced part.  \n   - **Full Grounding:** The author can accurately pinpoint the section, table, figure, or unique aspect being addressed. This can be achieved through:  \n     - Literal mentions of sections, tables, figures, etc.  \n     - Mentions of unique elements of the paper.  \n     - General comments that clearly imply the relevant parts without explicitly naming them.  \n\n2. **Specificity:** How clearly the comment details what is wrong or missing in the referenced part. If external work is mentioned, it also evaluates whether specific examples are provided.  \n\n**Importance:** It's more important for the comment to be grounded than to be specific.  \n\n**Grounding Specificity Scale (1-5):** \n\n1. **Not Grounded**\n   - **Definition**: This comment is not grounded at all. It does not identify a specific area in the paper. The comment is highly unspecific.\n\n2. **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**\n   - **Definition**: The authors cannot confidently determine which part the comment addresses. Further, the comment does not specify what needs to be addressed in this part.\n\n3. **Weakly Grounded and Specific**\n   - **Definition**: The authors cannot confidently determine which"}
