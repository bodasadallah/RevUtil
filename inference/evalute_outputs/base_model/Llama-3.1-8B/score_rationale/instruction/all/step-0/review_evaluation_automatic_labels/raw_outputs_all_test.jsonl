The scores should be accurate and reflect the quality of the review point. The rationales should be clear and concise, providing a justification for the scores.\n\n###Conclusion:\n- The evaluation demonstrates that the method is effective in evaluating review points based on the given aspects. The scores and rationales provide valuable insights into the quality of the review point and can help authors improve their drafts. However, it would be beneficial to see how the method performs on a larger and more diverse dataset to further validate its effectiveness.\n\n###Future Work:\n- Expand the dataset to include more complex molecules and materials to evaluate the method's performance on a larger and more diverse set of molecules.\n- Develop a more robust evaluation framework that can handle a wider range of review points and aspects.\n- Explore the use of machine learning techniques to automate the evaluation process and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the method.\n\n###References:\n- [1] \"Evaluating Review Points for Molecular Design: A Case Study on the MD17 Dataset.\" (2023).
