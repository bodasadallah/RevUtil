It also notes that while the quantitative analysis works, the qualitative aspect is lacking. This makes the feedback actionable as it points out specific areas for improvement.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity**: The review is grounded in specific examples, such as the lack of relation between attended areas and the actual task in 3D tasks, and the presence of clusters of attended pixels without clear meaning. It also references specific sections of the paper (Fig 2 and sec 4.2), which grounds the feedback in the context of the work.\n\n3. **Verifiability**: The review is verifiable because it provides specific examples and references to the paper that can be checked and validated. The mention of the quantitative analysis working adds credibility to the critique.\n\n4. **Helpfulness**: The review is helpful as it provides specific, actionable feedback that the authors can use to improve their work. It identifies both strengths (quantitative analysis) and weaknesses (qualitative intuitiveness), offering a balanced view that can guide further research and development.\n\nOverall, the review is well-constructed, specific, and provides valuable feedback that is both actionable and verifiable, making it highly helpful."}

However, it also mentions the need for more analysis on running time or complexity, which is less specific. Therefore, the actionability is somewhat clear but not fully concrete, warranting a score of 3.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is somewhat specific in suggesting an analysis of parameters k and N, but it lacks detail on how this analysis should be conducted or what specific aspects of running time or complexity should be examined. The mention of a potential mismatch between Figure 2 and its description adds some specificity, but overall, the comment is not highly specific, meriting a score of 2.\n\n3. **Verifiability**: The comment is verifiable as it suggests specific analyses that can be conducted (e.g., examining the impact of parameters k and N on running time). The suggestion to check the consistency between Figure 2 and its description is also verifiable. Therefore, the comment is reasonably verifiable, deserving a score of 3.\n\n4. **Helpfulness**: The comment is helpful as it identifies specific areas for improvement (analysis of parameters k and N, running time, and potential inconsistencies in figures). However, it could be more helpful if it provided more detailed suggestions on how to conduct these analyses. The mention of minor comments at the end suggests that there are other areas that could be improved, which slightly reduces the overall helpfulness. Thus, the comment is somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive, warranting a score of 3."}

This is a concrete action that can be taken, but it lacks specific details on how to implement this generalization. Therefore, it is somewhat actionable but not fully explicit.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is somewhat grounded as it refers to a specific aspect of the paper (batch sizes) but does not provide concrete details on what the current distribution is or what the alternative distribution might be. It is vague in terms of specifics.\n\n3. **Verifiability**: The comment is not easily verifiable because it does not provide specific evidence or references to support the suggestion of a different distribution.

The comment also provides a specific example (sampling 50% vs. 100% of the data) to illustrate the point, making it very clear and actionable.\n\n2. **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is extremely specific as it refers to a specific figure (Figure 7) and provides detailed information about what is observed in the figure. It also mentions a specific dataset (ImageNet) and a specific metric (linear evaluation), which grounds the comment in concrete details.\n\n3. **Verifiability**: The comment is highly verifiable as it provides specific, observable data points (Figure 7, ImageNet linear evaluation, sampling 50% vs. 100% of the data) that can be checked and verified by the authors.\n\n4. **Helpfulness**: The comment is highly helpful as it identifies a specific issue (more data leading to lower results on ImageNet linear evaluation) and provides clear guidance on what needs to be investigated. The specific example given (sampling 50% vs. 100% of the data) helps to narrow down the potential causes and provides a clear direction for further research.\n\nOverall, the comment excels in all three aspects, making it a highly effective and actionable piece of feedback."}
