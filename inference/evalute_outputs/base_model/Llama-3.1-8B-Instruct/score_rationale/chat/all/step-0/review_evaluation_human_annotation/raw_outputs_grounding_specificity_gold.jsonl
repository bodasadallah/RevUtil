{"generated_text": "**Review Point:** - Section 4.2 experiments with AutoAugment as a stronger augmentation strategy. One possible trap is that AutoAugment\u2019s policy is obtained by supervise training on ImageNet. Information leaking is likely. Questions - In L114 the authors concluded that for linear classification the pretraining dataset should match the target dataset in terms of being object or-scene centric. If this is true, is it a setback for SSL algorithms that strive to learn more generic representations? Then it goes back again to whether by combining two datasets SSL model can learn better representations.\n\n**Actionability Rationale:** The review point is somewhat actionable because it explicitly states an action (identifying a possible trap in AutoAugment's policy) but lacks detail on how to execute it.
