The claim is somewhat verifiable as it is supported by a clear explanation of what needs to be done to improve the paper. However, the justification is not fully explicit as it does not provide specific references or examples. Therefore, the verifiability score is 3: Somewhat Verifiable.\n\n**Verifiability Label:** 3\n\n**Helpfulness Rationale:** The review point is highly helpful as it provides clear and actionable feedback on how to improve the paper. The comment identifies a weakness (\"comparisons are not systematic\") and suggests a specific improvement (\"making these comparisons more systematic\"). The feedback is also detailed and empowering, as it provides a clear direction for the authors to follow. Therefore, the helpfulness score is 5: Highly Helpful.\n\n**Helpfulness Label:** 5\n\n**Output:**\n```\n{\n  \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review point is explicit as it directly states what needs to be done to improve the paper, but it is somewhat vague as it does not provide clear instructions on how to achieve this.
