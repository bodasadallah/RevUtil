{"generated_text": "**Review Point:** - One experiment to estimates the quality of uncertainty estimates measures how often the true feature importance lies within a 95% credible interval. However, the experiments uses pseudo feature importance because no true feature importance is available. The correctness of the pseudo feature importance relies on Prop 3.2 and a large enough perturbation value to be chosen. This makes it difficult to judge to what degree the experiment can be trusted because the difference between the tested method and the pseudo feature importance is only the number of perturbations. The experiment could be strengthened in two ways.\n\n**Actionability Rationale:** The review point is somewhat actionable because it explicitly states that the experiment could be strengthened in two ways, but it does not provide concrete details on how to implement these suggestions.
