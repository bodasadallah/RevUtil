{"generated_text": "**Review Point:** - Section 4.2 experiments with AutoAugment as a stronger augmentation strategy. One possible trap is that AutoAugment\u2019s policy is obtained by supervise training on ImageNet. Information leaking is likely. Questions - In L114 the authors concluded that for linear classification the pretraining dataset should match the target dataset in terms of being object or-scene centric.
