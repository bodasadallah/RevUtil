{"generated_text": "**Review Point:** \u2022 Your VAD description is puzzling. What is stated in the paper simply discards any TF bins that have a magnitude of less than epsilon. If this is what you do I wouldn't call it a VAD, you are simply discarding TF bins with zero magnitude that will result in a division by zero.
