None of the questions directly present a claim that needs verification. The reviewer is not stating that something is wrong with the paper, but rather asking questions about the methodology and its theoretical underpinnings. Therefore, there are no claims that are being evaluated for verifiability in this review point.", "helpfulness_rationale": "The reviewer raises several valid points that, if addressed, could significantly improve the paper. The request for clarification on the definition and calculation of 'excessive risk' is directly helpful for the authors to understand and implement the proposed method. The question about the potential for negative values highlights a potential misunderstanding or a gap in the explanation, which could be addressed by providing a more detailed explanation of the theoretical framework and the assumptions made. The observation about the positive values in the figures raises a valid concern about the practical application of the metric and requires further clarification. The request for justification of why 'excessive risk' is a good representation for fairness is also crucial for strengthening the paper's claims. While the questions are not explicitly framed as requests for action, they are all aimed at improving the authors' understanding and ability to implement the proposed method. Therefore, the review point has significant helpfulness potential if the issues raised are addressed."}
