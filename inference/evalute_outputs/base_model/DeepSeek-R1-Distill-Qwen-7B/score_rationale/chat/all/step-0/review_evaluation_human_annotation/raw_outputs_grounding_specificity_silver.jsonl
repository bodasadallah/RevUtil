It suggests this might introduce noise. Now, is this an explicit action? The reviewer is pointing out a problem and providing an example, so it's explicit. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how to fix it or what changes to make. They just point out the issue and an example. So, it's explicit but vague. That would make it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about the average of all possible instantiations. They mention the vocabulary and the issue of only one being correct, which grounds the comment to the specific part of the paper. They also explain why this could introduce noise, which adds specificity. So, the grounding is strong because they clearly reference the HIERENC description and explain the problem. This would be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer provides an example of how the average introduces noise and explains it logically. They don't cite external references, but their reasoning is clear and logical. So, this is **Somewhat Verifiable** because they support their claim with reasoning but lack external references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer points out a clear issue, provides an example, and explains the potential noise.

Does this affect the underestimation of the performances?\" The comment is asking for clarification, which is a direct action. It's explicit because the reviewer is clearly stating that they need more information. It doesn't provide vague instructions, so it's not implicit. Therefore, it's explicit and concrete. Actionability should be 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is asking for clarification, but it's not pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's a general question about the selection process. The reviewer isn't referencing any section, table, or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the part being addressed. Specificity isn't an issue here since the question is broad. The grounding specificity score would be 1 because it's not grounded at all.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a question seeking clarification. There's no claim being made here; it's just a request for more information. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiability. So, it's an \"X\" with a score of 1 because it's not a claim and thus unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is asking for clarification, which is helpful in guiding the reviewer to provide more detailed feedback. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't directly address the reviewers' concerns. It's somewhat helpful because it does prompt a detailed response but isn't comprehensive.

It's explicit because it directly mentions Table 4. However, it doesn't specify exactly what part of the table or what splits are needed. So, it's not giving concrete details on how to improve the table. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable because the authors know there's an issue, but they don't know exactly what to do.

It's unclear whether they're referring to a particular section or a specific detail within Table 4. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the clarification is needed.

The justification is vague\u2014it just says \"a little more clarification\" without explaining why or how. There's no reference to external sources or logical reasoning.

The reviewer does point out a potential bias, which is an explicit action. However, the comment doesn't specify how to correct the wording or what changes should be made. It's vague because it doesn't provide detailed steps or examples. So, it's not fully actionable. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which makes it borderline actionable.

However, this is more of a personal opinion rather than a direct action the authors should take. It doesn't explicitly tell them what to do or how to improve their figure.

That makes it somewhat actionable but not very specific. Maybe a 3 or 4?\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review is asking about the Challenge Set and its use. It doesn't clearly reference a specific part of the paper or provide details about the data split. It's more of a general question, so the grounding is weak. Maybe a 2 or 3?\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is asking about the Challenge Set's use and data split. It's a claim because it's making a statement about how the Challenge Set is used. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking a question without providing any helpful information or actionable suggestions. It's more of a clarifying question than a constructive comment. So, it's not very helpful. Maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores would be around 3 for actionability, 2 for grounding, 1 for verifiability, and 2 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review point is somewhat actionable but lacks explicit instructions on how to improve the draft, making it less helpful.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The review point does not clearly reference a specific part of the paper or provide details about the data split, resulting in weak grounding.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The review point contains a claim about the Challenge Set's use but lacks supporting evidence or justification, making it unverifiable.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The review point is more of a clarifying question than a constructive comment, offering limited helpfulness.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

It also points out that the performance isn't uniform across all parts of speech. Now, does this give the authors clear actions to take? It suggests looking into why nouns are underperforming and whether the gap is significant. But it's a bit vague. The authors might need more specific guidance, like checking specific parts of the dataset or trying certain adjustments. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit or concrete. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to nouns specifically, which is good because it's more precise than just saying the performance is poor. It also mentions the gap between TWSI and other clustering approaches, which is a specific part of the paper. Additionally, it points out that the performance isn't uniform across all parts of speech, which is a clear issue. So, this is fully grounded because it accurately identifies the sections being discussed. The specificity is also high because it details the exact areas where there's a problem. I'd give this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the performance isn't uniform across all parts of speech, which is a subjective judgment. It also suggests looking into why this is the case, which requires justification. The justification is present but could be more detailed, like citing specific studies or providing examples. However, it's not entirely clear, so it's somewhat verifiable. I think a 4 is appropriate here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review does point out specific areas for improvement and suggests looking into why the performance is poor and the gap exists.

The reviewer is pointing out that the section isn't clear enough. Now, is this actionable? Well, the reviewer is asking for examples, which is a direct action. But the problem is, they don't specify how to provide these examples. They just say \"can you provide examples.\" So, it's explicit in asking for something, but it's vague on how to do it. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear what's needed but lacks detail on the method.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions section 5.2 but doesn't specify which part of that section or what exactly is unclear. They just say it's abstract. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint the exact issue. They don't provide clear examples or references, so it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the discussion is abstract and lacks examples. They're suggesting the author provide examples, which is a claim. But there's no supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement that something is unclear without backing it up. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or references provided.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a problem and asking for examples.

Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit or concrete. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to a comparison with other methods but doesn't specify which ones or provide details on how the comparison was done.

The review says the authors focused mainly on SSC and didn't contrast it with TSC, Park's method, etc. It suggests these other methods are computationally efficient and have similar guarantees. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the review is pointing out a gap but doesn't tell the authors what to do next. They might need to add a comparison section or mention these methods. So, it's not explicit, hence not actionable. Maybe it's borderline because it's pointing out an area for improvement, but without specifics on how to act. So, I'd rate it as 2.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific methods like TSC and Park's work, so it's clearly pointing to certain parts of the paper. It's well grounded because it references specific clustering methods. Also, it explains why these are relevant\u2014computational efficiency and guarantees. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that there are other methods with similar benefits. It's supported by pointing out specific methods and their properties. So, it's well-justified. I think this is fully verifiable, so a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a relevant area for improvement by highlighting other clustering methods. It's clear and provides meaningful feedback. It's helpful because it guides the authors to expand their work.

It suggests removing the statement about semantic segmentation. Now, is this explicit? Yes, it's directly telling the authors to remove something. So that's explicit. Is it concrete? It tells them exactly where to make the change, so yes. So this should be 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions semantic segmentation but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It just says \"semantic segmentation is not low-level.\" So the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or figure. It's more general, so grounding_specificity would be 1.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that semantic segmentation isn't low-level. Is this supported? Well, it's a straightforward statement based on the definition that each pixel is specified, so it's somewhat justified. But it's not citing any external references or logical reasoning beyond the definition. So maybe it's somewhat verifiable, which would be 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about suggesting a removal. It gives a specific instruction, which is helpful.

The review point is asking whether the claim about the modules improving accuracy and completeness is valid and suggests using another dataset. The action here is questioning the claim and suggesting a change. But is this explicit? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out that the claim might not hold and suggesting an alternative. It's not giving a direct action like \"change this part\" or \"add something.\" So, it's more of an implicit suggestion. Also, it's vague because it's not providing specific steps or how to test the claim. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. Maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions using another dataset but doesn't specify which one. They just name two datasets, Tanks & Temples and ETH3D, but don't tie them directly to the paper. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly which part of the paper they're referring to. They're making a general suggestion without clearly linking it to the paper's sections. So, this is weak grounding.\n\nVerifiability. The claim here is that the results are dataset-dependent. The reviewer is suggesting a different dataset to test the claim. They're implying that the original results might not hold with another dataset. This is a claim because it's a judgment about the paper's robustness. Now, is this justified? The reviewer doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why another dataset would be better or how this would affect the results. It's a suggestion without backing, so it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nHelpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a potential limitation of the study and suggesting an improvement. This is helpful because it identifies an area for improvement. However, the suggestion is quite vague and doesn't provide specific guidance on how to conduct the ablation study or what changes to make. It's helpful but lacks depth, so maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores would be: Actionability 2, Grounding Specificity 2, Verifiability 1, Helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review point is an implicit suggestion to question the claim and propose a change, but it lacks explicit instructions on how to implement this change.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The reviewer mentions specific datasets but doesn't clearly link them to the paper's sections, resulting in weak grounding.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The claim is that the results are dataset-dependent, but there's no supporting evidence or reasoning.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The reviewer suggests an improvement but doesn't provide specific guidance, making it somewhat helpful.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

The review mentions that the authors consider a single vulnerability at a time, acknowledge data imbalance, and questions ecological validity. It also compares their approach to previous work that considers multiple vulnerabilities. The reviewer suggests whether the code contains any such vulnerabilities. The review ends by saying the results are difficult to interpret or marginal improvements.\n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions or suggestions. The reviewer points out a limitation in the methodology but doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They suggest comparing with previous work but don't provide a clear action. So, this is more of a suggestion without a direct action, which might be considered implicit. Since it's not explicit, it's probably not highly actionable. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer refers to specific aspects like single vulnerabilities, data imbalance, and compares to previous work. They mention specific elements of the paper, so the grounding is strong. They also discuss whether the authors are addressing an intended use case, which is a specific part. So, this should be fully grounded. The specificity is good because they clearly point out what's missing in the methodology.\n\nMoving to **Verifiability**. The reviewer makes a claim that the authors' approach is questionable and suggests comparing with previous work. This is a claim. They provide some reasoning about limitations and a reference to previous work, which is external support. So, it's somewhat verifiable but maybe not fully. Maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer provides feedback on methodology limitations, suggests a comparison, and points out interpretability issues.

It mentions that Theorem 1 and 2 show GCL's relationship with degree bias but it's not intuitive. I think this is an explicit action because it directly points out the need for more explanations. But is it concrete? It suggests adding explanations but doesn't specify how. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionable scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to Theorem 1 and 2, which are specific parts of the paper. It also mentions the relationship with degree bias, which is a specific aspect.

It specifically mentions the definition of resistance distance, more explanations on Algorithm 1 with brief sentences defining A_t, Y_t, etc.\n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the review gives explicit and concrete actions. The review does suggest providing more details on the resistance distance and Algorithm 1. However, it's a bit vague. It doesn't specify how to provide these details, like whether it should be expanded in the paper or just in the supplementary material. So, it's explicit about the areas needing improvement but doesn't give clear instructions on how to do that. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to the resistance distance and Algorithm 1. It mentions specific elements like A_t and Y_t. So, it's clearly pointing out specific parts of the paper. This means the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections that need improvement. The specificity is also good because it's not just a general critique but points to particular elements, which helps the authors know exactly where to focus their edits.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review makes a judgment that more details are needed and suggests specific areas. It doesn't reference external works or provide logical reasoning beyond the critique. So, it's a claim that needs support, but the support is minimal. It's somewhat verifiable because it does provide some reasoning but lacks references or deeper explanation.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is clear about pointing out specific areas for improvement and provides suggestions. It's not vague; it actually names what needs to be done. The suggestions are actionable and specific, which makes it highly helpful.

The comment is pointing out that this paper is relevant because it deals with hypergraph data using tensors, similar to their approach. Now, for actionability, it's about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The review here is pointing out a related work but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. It doesn't give explicit actions like suggesting specific changes or comparisons. So, it's more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's not giving clear steps on how to incorporate this related work, it's not fully actionable. Maybe the authors would need to read the paper themselves or figure out how to compare it, which isn't directly stated.

Therefore, this should be **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the related work but doesn't clearly link it to their specific work.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the authors missed a relevant paper. It's a claim because it's suggesting that the authors should have cited this work. Now, is this claim well-supported? The review doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to back up why this paper is relevant or why the authors missed it. It's just a statement without justification.

The reviewer is suggesting discussing different input types and presenting solutions, which is a clear action. But then they mention the citation being disordered.

It's giving a clear action: instead of synthetic data, use real data with various losses. That seems explicit. Also, it provides concrete details about what to do, like fine-tuning on real datasets. So, it's both explicit and concrete. I think this is highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions specific aspects like projection errors and different losses. It doesn't just say \"real-world data\" but specifies synthetic vs. real and different losses. So, the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. That's full grounding because it clearly identifies the sections or parts being discussed.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim by suggesting that comparing on synthetic data is unfair and proposing to show results on real data with specific losses.

It suggests conducting calibration curves and comparing with traditional methods. Now, looking at the explicitness, the reviewer is clear about the issues and the solutions, so that's explicit. For concreteness, they specify what to do (calibration curves and comparisons), so it's concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable because the reviewer is giving clear steps the authors can take.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about model discriminant ability, calibration curves, and compares with traditional methods. They're referring to specific parts of the model and the methods they should use. This is pretty grounded because they're pointing to specific sections or techniques the authors should focus on. It's not too vague, so I'd say fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the model's consistency is crucial for clinical scoring. They back this up by suggesting calibration curves and comparisons, which are logical reasons. They're using common knowledge about model evaluation and clinical applications, so this is well-supported. It's fully verifiable because the reasoning is clear and references are implicit but logical.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

The comment is a claim because it's making a judgment about the clarity of Appendix A.2. It's suggesting that the illustration is unclear. Now, is this claim verifiable?

It's more of a statement pointing out existing work rather than suggesting concrete fixes. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. I think this is borderline because it does hint at a direction but lacks specifics. Maybe a 3 or 4? Hmm, probably 3 since it's not fully actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to specific papers and techniques but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper is being discussed. It's a bit vague about how the combination affects the results. So, the grounding isn't strong because it's not pinpointing the exact issue.

It also points out that the model's motivation is similar to a prior VAE paper. I think this is more of an implicit suggestion. The reviewer isn't giving a specific action like \"modify the model architecture\" or \"add a new layer.\" Instead, they're pointing out a trend and suggesting exploration. So, it's not explicit. Also, the suggestion is vague because it doesn't specify how to explore further or what changes to make. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it's implicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer talks about energy models being unexplored and mentions a prior VAE paper for motivation. They do identify the specific part of the paper (energy models) and explain what's similar to the VAE. So, they grounded it by referring to a specific part and provided some context about the similarity. This seems like full grounding because they can pinpoint the area and explain the related work clearly.\n\nVerifiability. The claim here is that energy models are unexplored and that the model's motivation is similar to a VAE. The reviewer doesn't provide any evidence or justification for these claims. They just state them without supporting data or references. So, this is unverifiable because there's no backing to back up the assertions.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review offers some useful information by pointing out a research gap and a related work direction. However, the suggestions are quite broad and don't provide specific actionable steps. The reviewer mentions exploring further but doesn't outline how, which limits the practical help for the authors.

It seems like the reviewer is pointing out that the modulator is heuristic and that scalability issues require hyperparameter tuning.

It's supported by the fact that the models are old and small, which is a reference to external knowledge. So, it's well-supported. That makes it a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

Well, the reviewer is making a clear statement about what the study isn't. It doesn't suggest an alternative action the authors should take, just clarifies that it's not an ablation. So, it's more of a clarification than an actionable suggestion. That makes it borderline actionable because it's not giving a direct instruction on what to do next, but it's also not vague. It's pretty clear that the study isn't an ablation.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer is talking about a specific part of the study: the different subdomain sizes.

They're also clearly explaining what's wrong with it, which is that it's not an ablation study. So, this is fully grounded because they're referring to a specific section, and they're being specific about why it's not an ablation.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is making a claim here: that the study isn't an ablation study. They're suggesting that the authors should consider this. Now, is this claim verifiable? The reviewer is providing a clear reasoning: because the study didn't remove any component. This reasoning is logical and specific, so it's well-supported.

The reviewer is suggesting a comparison but isn't telling the authors exactly what to do.

They're asking for a comparison but aren't providing evidence. They're relying on the authors to figure out if the proposed method works better.

It also suggests a related work for discussion. Now, for actionability, it's about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are.

The reviewer doesn't tell the authors exactly how to do the comparison or where to find existing rates. So, it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete steps. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to the main result and mentions a strong assumption about data. It also suggests a comparison to existing literature. The grounding is clear because it directly references the main result and the data assumption. It's specific about the part of the paper being discussed. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the main result has a strong requirement on data and suggests a comparison. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. The claim is vague and lacks justification. So, this is unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out a limitation and suggests a comparison, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't specify how to perform the comparison or provide any data or references. It's somewhat helpful but not very detailed. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out that 44k dialogues might not be enough for LLMs to capture a wide range of user traits and personalities across different content topics. It mentions that LLMs are trained on trillions of tokens and questions if it's about personalities and domains. The reviewer is suggesting that the dataset needs to be much larger. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a problem, but they don't suggest any specific changes or actions. They just state that the dataset is insufficient. So, there's no explicit instruction on what to do next. It's more of a critique than a suggestion. Therefore, it's not very actionable because the reviewer isn't providing clear steps or modifications the authors should make. So, I'd rate this as 2: Borderline Actionable because it does hint at a problem but lacks specific guidance.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about 44k dialogues and whether it's sufficient. They mention that LLMs are trained on trillions of tokens and that the dataset needs to be massive. The grounding here is about the specific dataset size. The reviewer is clear about what the dataset size is and what it's supposed to cover. They don't make any vague statements about the dataset; instead, they specify the size and the required coverage. So, the grounding is explicit and clear. The specificity is also good because they're directly addressing the dataset's size and its relation to capturing user traits and domains. Therefore, this should be a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is making a claim that 44k dialogues are insufficient and that LLMs typically require trillions of tokens and a massive dataset. They back this up by stating that LLMs are trained on trillions of tokens and that the dataset needs to be varied. This is a strong claim with clear reasoning and references to common knowledge about LLM training data.

They mention specific parts like base node, key nodes, and model performance, which is explicit. So, grounding is fully grounded because they're clearly pointing out specific sections of the paper.

The review says, \"Please define the bounds for \u03c4_i^l because it is important for understanding the time-warp function.\" The action here is asking the author to define the bounds. Is this explicit? Yes, it's a direct instruction. But is it concrete? The reviewer is asking for a definition, but they don't specify how or where to apply this. So, it's explicit but not very concrete. I think this would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on how to implement it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper, \u03c4_i^l, which is related to the time-warp function. They mention it's important, so the grounding is explicit. They also specify that defining the bounds is necessary. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That should be a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion to define bounds, which is a claim. There's no external reference or justification provided. It's just a request. So, it's not verifiable. I think this would be a 1: Unverifiable because there's no supporting evidence or reasoning given.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking for a definition, which is helpful but quite vague. They don't provide any context or why defining the bounds is important. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. I'd rate this a 3: Somewhat Helpful because it gives a reason but doesn't elaborate on the importance or how to define them.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores are as follows: actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review explicitly states an action (defining the bounds) but is vague on how to implement it.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3: Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The review explicitly mentions the specific part of the paper (\u03c4_i^l) and clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5: Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The review contains a claim (asking for a definition) but provides no justification or evidence.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1: Unverifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The review provides a reason for the action but lacks depth and context, making it somewhat helpful.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3: Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

Overall, you could have edited the space of main paper more wisely.\" \n\nFirst, I check if it's an explicit or implicit action. The reviewer is pointing out that Figure 1's allocation is naive and suggests a better approach. That's an explicit statement because it tells the author what's wrong and what they should do. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer mentions that the allocation is too naive and suggests a better way, which gives the author a clear direction. So, it's both explicit and concrete. Therefore, the actionability should be 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about Figure 1 and the main paper. They mention specific elements like the allocation being too naive and suggest a better editing approach. This shows that the reviewer is accurately pointing out the specific part of the paper, so grounding is fully grounded. They also clearly states what needs to be addressed, making it specific. So, grounding_specificity is 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer's claim is that the allocation is too naive and that a better approach could be used.

The review mentions (L0,L1)-smoothness and compares it to Zhang et al., which means it's clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper.

It seems like it's pointing out a limitation, but it's more of an observation rather than a direct action. So, it's not explicit because the authors aren't told exactly what to do.

It doesn't specify what needs to be done, so it's more of a question than a suggestion. That means it's not explicit or actionable. It's vague because it doesn't tell the authors how to improve or what to check. So, it's probably a 1 for actionability since it's unactionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions an ablation study but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's unclear whether it's talking about a specific section or the entire results. Since it doesn't pinpoint the issue, the grounding is weak.

It mentions PCA experiments in specific figures. I think this is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors where to add details. It's not just a suggestion; it's a clear instruction. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies which figures to add explanations for. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review points out specific figures (3,7,8) and mentions PCA. That's pretty specific. It's not just saying \"Appendix needs more details,\" but it's pinning down exact sections. So, the grounding is strong. It's fully grounded because it accurately identifies the parts, and it's specific because it mentions what's missing. So, this should be 5 as well.\n\nVerifiability. The review claims that the PCA experiments aren't explained. To verify this, we need to see if there's supporting evidence. The reviewer is pointing out a deficiency, which is a claim.

So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the referenced part. The specificity is also low because it doesn't clearly explain what's wrong or what needs improvement. It's just a general critique without pointing to a specific section or issue.\n\nMoving on to Verifiability. The review contains a claim: \"fast SMP is less expressive than SMP.\" This is a subjective opinion. Now, is this claim verifiable? The reviewer is making a judgment based on their understanding of the architectures. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided to back this up. It's a personal opinion without justification, so it's not verifiable. Therefore, it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review raises a valid point about the comparison between fast SMP and regular SMP. It's a meaningful critique and provides a suggestion for more discussion. However, the suggestion is vague and doesn't offer specific guidance on what to discuss. It's helpful because it points out an area for improvement, but it's not the most helpful because it lacks specifics.

It's a clear question, so it's explicit. But does it give enough guidance on how to answer? It's a bit vague because it doesn't specify what kind of explanation is needed. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 or 4? I think 3 because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to approach the explanation.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points out a specific difference between Online and Batch Normalization. It mentions that Online doesn't depend on batch size, which is a clear reference. Then, it asks about the bias difference, which is specific to the part of the paper. So, the grounding is strong because it clearly references the section. The specificity is also good because it's asking about a particular aspect of the normalization methods. I'd give this a 4 because it's well-grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim that Online Normalization is unbiased and Batch is biased. The reviewer is asking for an explanation, which is a claim. To verify this, the author would need to provide evidence, like mathematical proofs or empirical results.

The action here is recommending a method, which is explicit. However, it doesn't provide specific steps on how to implement this, so it's more of a suggestion without concrete details. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific papers, which is a clear reference to external work. It also talks about labeled data and its benefits for graph anomaly detection, which is a specific part of the task. This seems well-grounded because it's pointing to particular works and clearly states the application. So, this should be a 4.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is suggesting a method based on existing literature.

The comment is explicit about the action, so that's good. It also gives concrete details on where to focus, which makes it actionable. So, this should be a high score.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment specifically mentions ImageNet and out-of-distribution detection.

It mentions that in the common scenario of old vs new judgments, new items are all items available in memory minus those seen before. The reviewer points out that creating an exhaustive list is hard to implement and that simulations can't effectively test it. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a problem with the method, suggesting that it's impractical to create such a list. But does this give the authors a clear action to take? It seems more like a critique without specific advice on what to do next. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of a problem statement than a solution. Therefore, I think it's **Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest a problem but doesn't provide a clear action.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about recognition lists and the challenges in implementing them. It mentions that new items are all items in memory minus seen ones. Is this clearly referencing a specific part of the paper? The reviewer is talking about the method of how new items are determined, which is a specific part. However, the comment doesn't specify what needs to be addressed, like suggesting an alternative method or how to test it. So, it's **Fully Grounded and Under-Specific** because it identifies the part but doesn't specify what to do about it.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that creating an exhaustive list is hard to implement and that simulations can't test it. Is this claim supported by evidence? The reviewer is citing practical difficulties and the limitations of simulations, which are common knowledge. So, the claim is well-supported, making it **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

The review mentions specific terms like line 113 and 115, so it's clearly pointing to specific parts of the paper. It's well-grounded because it references exact sections. However, the advice is quite vague about what to do next. So, it's weakly grounded but not specific in the details.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim about CD capturing more than predictive uncertainty and why entropy might not be the best measure. It's suggesting an opinion or judgment, which is a claim. The justification is vague, just pointing to line 113 without explaining why it wasn't clear.

It suggests that in the general case, it's costly to label a large amount of data. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a problem (expensive labeling) but doesn't specify what the authors should do. They don't suggest any solutions or improvements, just stating the issue. So, it's not explicit because it's more of a statement than a direct action. It's also vague because it doesn't provide any specific steps or fixes.

It's talking about the general case of labeling data, which is a broad issue. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the problem lies.

It says this leads to a different estimator but isn't fundamentally different. The reviewer suggests the paper should be upfront about its contribution. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a lack of clarity, so it's more of an implicit suggestion. Also, the advice is vague because it doesn't specify how to make the paper more transparent. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to do. Therefore, it's borderline actionable but not fully actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about the number of bins and autotuning a hyperparameter. They mention ECE_sweep and the estimator change.

Yes, it directly mentions that other methods are discussed but not used as a baseline. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The comment tells the authors to check other methods but doesn't specify how to implement this. So it's explicit but not concrete. Therefore, it's 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions related work methods but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is missing. It's a general statement, so the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part. It's not grounded at all.

The use of \"is\" suggests a particular one, but since there's no specific proxy named, it's more about the family. So, the reviewer is pointing out ambiguity. Is this actionable? Well, the reviewer is clarifying the ambiguity, which the authors can use to understand they need to specify which proxy they're referring to. That's explicit, so it's actionable. But is it concrete?

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review says the paper should provide more explanation and discusses different optimization strategies for Eq 3. It mentions specific examples like minimizing both terms or just the first. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a need for more explanation but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be added. They suggest looking at Eq 3, but don't tell the authors exactly which parts to change or how. So, it's not explicit enough. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which means the authors still have to figure out what to do. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. Maybe a 3 or 4? Since it's vague, I'll go with 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions Eq 3 but doesn't specify which part of the paper or figure that refers to. They talk about different optimization strategies but don't tie it back to a specific section or figure in the paper. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. They know to look at Eq 3, but not the exact part. So, it's not fully grounded. Maybe a 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific? Wait, no. If they don't specify what needs to be addressed, it's weakly grounded. So, 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific? Or maybe 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific? Hmm, since they do mention Eq 3, which is specific, but don't tie it to a part, it's a bit confusing. Maybe 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is making a judgment that more explanation is needed and suggests looking at Eq 3. But they don't provide any evidence or reasoning to back this up. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable. It's more of an opinion without support. So, this would be 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out a needed improvement but doesn't specify what exactly should be done. They suggest looking at Eq 3 but don't give clear directions on how to improve it. This is somewhat helpful because it identifies an area for improvement, but it's vague and lacks depth. So, it's somewhat helpful, which would be a 3.\n\nWait, but for grounding specificity, I'm a bit unsure. The reviewer mentions Eq 3, which is specific, but doesn't tie it to a part of the paper. So, it's not fully grounded because the authors don't know which section to focus on. So, it's weakly grounded but specific in the sense that they know to look at Eq 3. Hmm, maybe 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating grounding specificity. Since the reviewer doesn't specify the part of the paper, it's weakly grounded. But they do mention Eq 3, which is specific. So, maybe 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nWait, no. Grounding specificity is about how well the reviewer refers to the paper. If they mention a specific equation, that's grounding, but if they don't specify which part of the paper that equation is in, it's weakly grounded. So, it's weakly grounded but specific in the equation. So, maybe 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific because they don't explain which part of the paper is affected by Eq 3. So, the authors don't know which section to improve. Therefore, it's weakly grounded because they can't confidently determine the part addressed, but they do specify what needs to be addressed (improve explanation around Eq 3).

So, this is unverifiable. It's a 1 because it's not supported by anything.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The comment is asking the author which method was used, which is a bit vague. It doesn't provide any specific feedback or suggestions on how to improve the work. Without knowing the method, the author can't really make any changes. So, this is not very helpful. It's more of a question without actionable steps. I'd rate this as 2 because it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth and clarity.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own rationale and score based on how well the review point helps the author improve their work.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The comment is vague and does not specify which method was used, making it unclear what action the author should take.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The comment does not specify which alternating direction method was used, leading to weak grounding as the author cannot confidently identify the referenced part.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The comment contains a claim but lacks supporting evidence or justification, making it unverifiable.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The comment is vague and does not provide specific feedback or suggestions, making it somewhat helpful but lacking depth.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

Here, the reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't suggesting any specific changes. They're just stating that it's not novel. So, it's not explicit or actionable. It's more like a criticism without a solution. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it's vague on how to improve, so I'd give it a 2.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**.

But they don't specify which part of the paper or why it's an issue. They're making a general statement without pointing to a specific section or problem. So, the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the referenced part. It's not fully grounded either because they don't explain what's wrong.

The comment is explicit in pointing out the issues, so that's good. But it's a bit vague on what exactly needs to be done. It doesn't specify whether they should increase the model size or try different architectures. So, it's explicit but not concrete.

The review mentions the model size and baselines but doesn't tie these specifics to a particular part of the paper. It's a bit vague about which sections or unique aspects are affected.

Therefore, it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests improvements but doesn't provide any evidence or references.

They might not know if it's the model architecture, training procedure, or something else. So it's grounded but not fully specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a suggestion, so it's a claim.

The review says, \"Evidently, replacing any of the procedure steps of XAIFOILER with a random mechanism dropped its performance.\" The word \"evidently\" here is key. It's directly telling the authors that replacing steps with a random mechanism caused a drop in performance. That's an explicit action, so it's actionable. Now, is it concrete? The review doesn't specify how much performance dropped or what steps were replaced. It just says \"dropped its performance,\" which is vague. So, it's explicit but not concrete. Therefore, on a scale of 1 to 5, it should be 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions XAIFOILER, which I assume is a specific model or algorithm. It talks about replacing procedure steps, which is specific to that model. So, the grounding is solid because it's referring to a specific part of the paper. The specificity comes from mentioning the model and the procedure steps. The review doesn't provide examples or external references, but it's clear about what's being addressed. So, this should be 4: Fully Grounded and Under-Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that replacing steps with a random mechanism affects performance. It's supported by the fact that the model's performance dropped, which is a logical reasoning. There's no external reference, but the reasoning is clear. So, it's thoroughly supported, making it 5: Fully Verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a limitation of the model, which is helpful. It gives a clear reason why certain steps are important. However, it doesn't suggest specific improvements or alternative methods. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue but doesn't provide actionable steps for the authors to fix it. So, it should be 3: Somewhat Helpful.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The review is clear and specific about the model, so grounding is good. The claim is well-supported by logical reasoning, so verifiability is high.

Therefore, it's borderline actionable because the action is implicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions METEOR results but doesn't specify which part of the paper it refers to. The reviewer is making an educated guess that the authors should include METEOR in their results section, but it's not clearly pinpointed.

It also gives concrete details on how to implement the comparison, so it's not vague. Therefore, this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to \"supervised baselines\" and mentions datasets of ~100k images. It's specific about the type of comparison, which is between self-supervised and fully supervised methods. The grounding is strong because it clearly points to the specific part of the paper where these baselines should be added. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests adding supervised baselines and comparing them to self-supervised ones. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion. However, it's a clear claim, so it's somewhat verifiable. It doesn't cite any external works, but it's a logical suggestion based on common knowledge. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a missing part and suggests a meaningful comparison. It's clear and provides a specific direction for improvement. It's helpful because it guides the authors to add these baselines and compare methods. It's not the most detailed, but it's sufficient.

The review says the authors' derivation uses classical learning theory, which doesn't yield realistic bounds unless Bayesian considerations are added. Hmm, so the reviewer is pointing out a methodological issue. Is this an explicit action? It seems like the reviewer is making a statement about the approach, but it's more of an opinion rather than a direct instruction. So, it's not explicit because it's not telling the authors what to do. It's more of a critique. Therefore, it's not actionable because the reviewer isn't providing a clear step or change the authors should make. So, I'd rate this as 1 for Actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions classical learning theory and Bayesian-PAC bounds. They're being specific about the type of bounds and suggesting Bayesian considerations. So, the reviewer is clearly pointing out a specific part of the paper and what's wrong with it. That means they have full grounding because they're referring to a particular aspect, and they're specific about what needs to be addressed.

The review mentions p(y | H f_bar(tn)) but doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. It's unclear whether this is a figure, a section, or another element. The grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is.

It tells the authors what happens when weight decay is too high, which is explicit. But it doesn't tell them what to do next. So it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to fix it.

The review refers to weight decay and cosine similarities, which are specific technical terms. It mentions that plots end at a point where similarities are still optimal, which is a specific part of the paper. So the grounding is solid because it points to a specific area.

The review mentions that the study's improvement could be due to regularization effects because the fine-tuning is done for 10 epochs without early-stopping. It suggests proper ablation studies are needed. So, the action here is pointing out a possible alternative explanation. But is this explicit? Yes, it's stating that regularization effects could be an alternative. However, it's vague because it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next, like conducting ablation studies. So, it's not giving a clear action. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it's pointing out an issue but not providing a direct action.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to regularization effects, which is a specific concept in machine learning. It also mentions fine-tuning on GLUE without validation early-stopping, which is a specific part of their methodology. So, the grounding is pretty solid because it's clearly pointing out a specific part of their work. Additionally, it's specific because it's explaining what needs to be checked. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The review makes a claim that the improvement could be due to regularization effects. It supports this by mentioning the usual high variances in fine-tuning on GLUE without validation and the need for ablation studies. This provides some justification and references, so it's somewhat verifiable. It's not fully verifiable because it's not citing specific external references, but it's better than unverifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review is pointing out a potential flaw in the methodology and suggesting a necessary step. It's clear and provides actionable feedback, so it's highly helpful.

The first part mentions adding tasks like word similarity and sentence translation, which are explicit actions. The second part talks about adding morphologically rich languages, which is also an explicit action. Both are clear and direct, so they are actionable. Since the actions are explicit and concrete, the score should be 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review points specifically mention adding certain tasks and languages. The mention of MUSE paper and others provides clear grounding, and the specific languages like Finnish and Hebrew are also mentioned. This shows that the reviewers are pinpointing specific parts of the paper, so the grounding is fully specific. Therefore, the score here is 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review points are suggesting improvements but aren't claiming to be verifiable. They're just providing recommendations. Since there's no claim being made, it's an \"X\" for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

The comment is explicit about the 1-shot scenario, so that's good. It also mentions a related work (RALE) that does have a 1-shot setting, which gives a clear direction for the authors to compare their approach. However, it doesn't provide specific steps on how the authors should modify their experiments or what changes they should make. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details.

The review points out a specific part of the paper\u2014the experiments section\u2014without clearly stating which part. It refers to the 1-shot setting but doesn't name the exact section or figure. It also doesn't specify what's missing or why the 1-shot setting is important. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact area and lacks specificity in explaining the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests that the authors should compare their method with RALE in a 1-shot setting. This is a claim because it's making a judgment about the appropriateness of their approach. The support comes from citing RALE, which is a relevant external reference. However, the explanation is a bit vague\u2014it doesn't explain why comparing in a 1-shot setting is necessary or how it would help. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but not enough detail.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review raises a valid point about the experimental setup and provides a relevant comparison with RALE. However, it's somewhat generic.

So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it identifies an issue but doesn't offer enough guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own rationale and score based on how well the review point meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The comment explicitly states that the paper lacks additional experiments but does not provide explicit guidance on how to implement these experiments, making it somewhat actionable.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The comment does not specify which part of the paper is lacking experiments, only that the paper lacks them in general, making it weakly grounded.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The comment contains a claim about the paper lacking necessary experiments but does not provide any supporting evidence or references, making it unverifiable.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The comment identifies a deficiency in the paper but does not provide specific suggestions or details on how to address it, making it somewhat helpful.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the proposed method doesn't have an advantage without prior information and that the comparison is unfair because it requires two models. It suggests considering the extra complexity and cost. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The review does point out the lack of advantage and the need for extra models, which is explicit. However, it's more of a suggestion rather than a direct action. It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do, like modifying their method or comparing with another model. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully. I think it's a 3 on the actionable scale because it's explicit but vague on the exact steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review talks about the proposed method requiring two models and compares it to SOTA. It mentions the need for prior knowledge. Grounding refers to identifying the specific part of the paper. The review does mention the specific issue with the method and the comparison to SOTA, so it's fully grounded. Then, it specifies what's missing, which is the prior knowledge and the extra models. So, it's both grounded and specific. That should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the comparison is unfair because of the extra models. It needs justification. The justification is that the extra complexity and cost should be considered. However, it's a bit vague. It mentions the need to evaluate the trade-offs but doesn't provide specific references or logical reasoning beyond that. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd rate it a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out a flaw in the comparison and suggests considering additional models. It's clear and provides some actionable feedback. However, it doesn't offer a solution or alternative approach. It just criticizes the method and suggests a modification. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I think a 3 here makes sense.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything. For actionability, it's explicit but not concrete. For grounding, it's fully grounded and specific. Verifiability is somewhat supported but lacks depth. Helpfulness is clear but doesn't push for a solution. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review explicitly states the lack of advantage and the unfair comparison but does not provide concrete steps for the authors to take.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review says there are no collaborative games in experiments and suggests looking at both collaborative and competitive settings. Is this explicit? It tells the authors to consider another setting but doesn't specify how to do that. So it's explicit in pointing out an action but vague on the details. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear that an action is needed but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions collaborative games but doesn't specify which part of the paper or experiment this refers to. It's a general suggestion without pointing to a particular section or figure. So the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. It's not fully grounded since it's not narrowing down to a specific part.\n\nVerifiability. The review is making a suggestion, so it's a claim. It's suggesting looking at another setting, but it doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. The claim isn't backed up, making it hard for the authors to trust the reasoning.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review is pointing out a potential improvement but doesn't elaborate on why collaborative games are important or how they might affect the experiments. It's vague and doesn't offer concrete advice.

Explicitly telling authors what to do is explicit actionability. Plus, it gives a clear direction, so it's actionable. I don't see any implicit actions here, so it's not borderline. So, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions Figures 1-9 but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're in. It's just a general statement, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the referenced part, which means it's not fully grounded. Since it's not fully grounded, it doesn't get a 5. Maybe a 3 because it partially identifies the figures but doesn't specify what's missing in them.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a judgment that the experimental settings are missing, which is a claim. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review clearly points out the missing information and suggests adding it. It's specific about what's missing and what should be added, which is helpful. It's not vague, so it's more than just somewhat helpful. It's actually quite helpful, so a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The review is direct, specific, and suggests clear actions. It doesn't provide much justification, so verifiability is low. Grounding is weak because it doesn't pin down the figures. Actionability is high because it's explicit.

It says some isolation methods leverage sparsity but doesn't clarify how the proposed method avoids this. So, the action is suggested, but the details are vague. That makes it **Borderline Actionable** because they do hint at an action but don't provide specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to activation channels in deep networks but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's talking about.

The review refers to the regularization term and mentions that some statistics could replace mean and standard deviation.

It's more general, which might make it a 2 for grounding specificity since it's not fully grounded but not weak either.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests using the median instead of the mean but doesn't provide any justification or references.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that supervised pretraining based on homo-lumo gap might cause negative transfer, citing QM9 results. It also points out that this contradicts the paper's claim of being a general-purpose model. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is making a claim about the model's limitations, which implies that the model isn't general-purpose. So, it's an implicit action because the reviewer isn't directly telling the authors to modify their model but is pointing out a potential issue. \n\nIs it concrete? The reviewer is pointing out specific tasks where the model performs poorly, which gives the authors a clear idea of what to look into. However, it's not giving direct instructions on how to fix it. So, it's somewhat actionable because the authors know the areas of concern, but they still need to figure out the next steps themselves.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about QM9 and Transformer-M's performance. They mention specific tasks like homo, lumo, and gap. This is pretty specific because they're pinning down exact sections or results in the paper. The reviewer is also general enough to imply that this is a problem for the model's general claim, which is good grounding. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that pretraining on homo-lumo gaps causes negative transfer. They back this up by citing QM9 results. This is logical reasoning and provides specific examples, so it's thoroughly supported. Therefore, it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer points out specific tasks where the model underperforms and ties it to the paper's general claim. This is helpful because it guides the authors to focus on certain areas.

It points out that the phenomenon is about the variation between test and train distributions vanishing. The comment also mentions that it's hard to conclude this from a few test functions. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, they're directly pointing out the term is too strong. So that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? They do give an example of the variation vanishing and that it's not necessarily the case with a few test functions. So they're providing some specifics. Therefore, it's actionable because the authors can understand the issue and maybe adjust their terminology.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions the variation between test and train distributions. It's specific about the phenomenon being discussed. They also reference test and train distributions, which are specific parts of the paper. So the grounding is solid because they're pointing to exact sections and concepts. The specificity is good because they explain what the issue is in detail, not just stating a problem.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim that the term is too strong.

The reviewer is suggesting that the author should explain that the optimistic rewards are close to actual ones. \n\nIs this explicit? The reviewer is asking the author to clarify what \"sufficient\" refers to, so it's an explicit action. But is it vague? The reviewer isn't giving specific instructions on how to improve the draft. They just ask the author to explain the connection between optimistic and actual rewards. So, it's explicit but vague. \n\nLooking at the scale, 3 is somewhat actionable because it's explicit but lacks detail on implementation. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is pointing out issues at specific line numbers, L240 and L428. The reviewer is asking for clarification on what \"sufficient\" refers to, which is specific to those lines. So, the grounding is solid because it's clearly pointing to those sections. The specificity is about what's missing in those parts, which is about the relationship between optimistic and actual rewards. The reviewer is clear about the sections and what's wrong, so this is fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim that \"is sufficient\" is vague, but they're suggesting that the author should explain the connection. The claim is that the author should provide more detail. Is this supported by evidence? Well, the reviewer is pointing out that the term is vague, which is a form of justification.

It talks about the theorems following from algorithm design and mutual information. It also suggests looking into sample complexity for training data. Now, for actionability, it's about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The review does suggest specific areas for improvement, like looking into sample complexity, which is good. However, it's quite vague about how to implement these suggestions. For example, it doesn't specify which parts of the algorithm to modify or how to conduct the analysis. So, while it's somewhat actionable, it's not very concrete. I think this would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it mentions areas to improve but doesn't give clear steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. This aspect is about how specific the review is regarding the paper's parts. The review talks about theoretical discussions needing improvement and references specific properties like mutual information and \u0394_{DP}. It also mentions sample complexity but doesn't tie it directly to a specific part of the paper. It's a bit vague about which sections or unique aspects are affected. So, the grounding isn't fully there. I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does touch on specific properties but doesn't clearly point to a particular section or issue.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review makes a claim by suggesting improvements and providing some reasoning, like the theorems following from mutual information. It references known properties, which adds some justification. However, it doesn't cite specific external references or examples, so the support is there but not robust. I think this is **4: Mostly Verifiable** because it has some justification but lacks specific examples or citations.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

It suggests this is a VAD issue but also mentions division by zero. The reviewer is pointing out a potential mistake. Is this explicit? Yes, they're directly telling the author to check their VAD implementation. Is it concrete? They mention the division by zero, which gives a clear action. So this is highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about VAD, which is a specific part of the paper. They also mention frequency bins and division by zero, which are specific technical details.

They back this up by explaining the potential mistake, which is logical reasoning. So this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

But since it's vague, I think it's more like 2: Borderline Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It just says the framework is a combination of two learning methods. Without pointing out a specific issue or area, the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the referenced part, so it's weakly grounded and not specific. That would be a 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a statement of fact: it's a combination of two known learning methods. There's no claim or suggestion, so it's a normal statement. That means it's not verifiable because there's no evidence or reasoning provided. So it's an X: No Claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out that the framework is a simple combination of two existing methods. While it's technically correct, it doesn't provide any meaningful feedback to the authors. It doesn't suggest improvements or identify weaknesses, so it's not helpful at all. That's a 1: Not Helpful at All.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects.

The review mentions an example paper, which is specific. It clearly states that the example can be found there, so the grounding is strong. It also specifies what kind of case study to use, which adds to the specificity. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability.

Now, is it concrete? The review doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this change, like whether to use a different module or what hyperparameters to adjust.

It points out that directly comparing with their numbers is unfair. The suggestion is to reproduce their results using the same setting, as most recent methods share their code.\n\nIs this actionable? Well, it's suggesting a specific change: using the same training settings. That's clear. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? They need to adjust their hyperparameters and code. So it's explicit but might be a bit vague on the details, like which hyperparameters to change and how. So maybe it's explicit but not super detailed.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions AdamW and cosine lr, but does it clearly identify which part of the paper it's addressing? It says \"their results,\" which is a bit vague. They might not be pinpointing exactly where the issue is. So the grounding isn't fully specific because it's a bit unclear which part of the paper they're referring to.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim that comparing methods with different settings is unfair. It suggests reproducing results with the same setting. Is this claim well-supported? They're pointing out a methodological issue but don't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond stating the problem. So it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth.\n\nHelpfulness. The review is pointing out a flaw in their methodology and suggesting a solution. It gives a clear direction for the authors to follow, which is helpful. However, it's somewhat generic and doesn't delve into the specifics of why the setting matters or how to implement the change effectively. So it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is explicit in its suggestions but lacks concrete details.

It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do, like suggesting specific changes or providing examples. So, it's not explicit. It's more vague because it doesn't specify how to fix these issues.

So it's fully grounded but not specific enough.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim about suggesting changes to the formula and learning rate. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's unverifiable. There's no supporting evidence, which makes it hard for the authors to understand the reasoning behind the suggestions.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review does suggest specific changes, which is helpful. However, it doesn't explain why these changes are beneficial or provide any rationale, making it somewhat helpful but not fully.

The review suggests adding discussions about the domain gap, mentioning that some datasets are closer, which might not be a big issue. It also talks about finetuning a pre-trained model on synthetic data, which could enhance the approach's value. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The review mentions specific actions like adding discussions and finetuning, which are clear. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement these actions, like whether to use a particular method or framework for finetuning. So, it's explicit in suggesting actions but not concrete enough on how to do them. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on the implementation.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to the domain gap and synthetic data without pinpointing specific sections or elements in the paper. It's vague about which parts of the paper need improvement or how synthetic data should be used. Therefore, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced parts. So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** since it does mention the issues but doesn't specify the exact areas or methods.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting adding discussions and finetuning. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for these suggestions. It just states that these actions would enhance the approach's value without backing it up. This means the claim isn't well-supported, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review offers some useful feedback by pointing out the domain gap and suggesting finetuning, which could be beneficial. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to implement these changes. While it's somewhat helpful, it lacks the depth needed to be fully helpful.

[1] shows that with a strong noise distribution, this line of work is possible to learn EBM on natural images.\" \n\nFirst, is this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is suggesting including an NCE-based method, which is a clear action. But they're not telling the authors exactly how to implement it. They just mention that [1] shows something, but they don't specify how to apply that. So it's implicit. Next, is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't give any specific steps or details on how to use NCE or how the noise distribution applies. So it's vague. Therefore, this is borderline actionable because it's implicitly suggesting an action but lacks detail.\n\nMoving on to Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions \"NCE-based methods\" and refers to [1]. Is this well grounded? They're talking about a specific method, so that's full grounding because they mention the section or unique aspect. Then, they specify what the cited work shows, which is about noise distributions for EBM on natural images. That's specific because they're pointing out a particular detail from the referenced work. So this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that NCE-based methods should be included and referencing [1]. Is this claim verifiable? The reference is cited, and the claim is that a strong noise distribution allows learning EBM on natural images. This is supported by external literature, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review provides a suggestion and cites relevant work, which is helpful.

But does it give enough detail on how to implement this? The comment mentions the previous work and asks the authors to discuss it, but it doesn't specify how to connect it to their method. So, it's explicit in wanting an action but lacks detail on how to do it.

It mentions that the existing methods use smaller datasets, like GEM with 20M. The reviewer is pointing out that the scale affects accuracy, so the proposed method's superiority might be due to the new dataset. \n\nIs this explicit? The reviewer is suggesting a reason for the comparison being unfair, which is a direct action. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is pointing out that dataset size impacts accuracy but doesn't specify how or what needs to be done. It's more of an observation than a clear action. So I'd say it's somewhat actionable because it's explicit but vague on the fix.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions the 209M dataset and smaller ones like GEM. This clearly references a specific part of the paper\u2014the datasets used. So the grounding is full because they're pointing out a specific section. The specificity is about comparing datasets, which is clear. So this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the comparison is unfair due to dataset size. They're suggesting that the new method's success is partly because of a larger dataset. To support this, they need to explain why dataset size matters. They mention that it's a known factor, so that's logical reasoning. They're citing common knowledge, which makes the claim somewhat verifiable. It's not fully verifiable because they don't provide specific references or examples, but it's better than nothing.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

It raises questions about the duality gap and maximization over non-norm constraints, suggesting the algorithm might be irrelevant or providing risk bounds. It also asks about using true mean through an oracle for better defense design. \n\nIs this explicit? The reviewer is asking questions but not giving clear instructions on what to do next. It's more of a discussion than a direct action. So, it's not explicit. It's more implicit because it's prompting the authors to think about these issues rather than telling them what to do. \n\nIs it concrete? The reviewer is pointing out specific problems but not providing detailed steps on how to address them. So, it's not very concrete. It's more of a thought-provoking comment without actionable steps. \n\nTherefore, this review point is **Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest areas for improvement but lacks explicit directions and details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions non-convex losses, non-norm type defenses, duality gaps, and maximization over non-norm constraints. It's clear which parts of the paper it's addressing because it's referencing specific technical terms. \n\nHowever, the reviewer is also asking about the use of the true mean through an oracle for better defense design. While the first part is grounded, the second part is more of a hypothetical question without specifying exactly how it would be applied. So, while the main points are grounded, the question is a bit vague.\n\nThis makes the grounding somewhat weak because it's not entirely clear if the entire comment is grounded or just parts of it. The question is a bit ambiguous.\n\nSo, the grounding specificity is **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because the main points are grounded, but the hypothetical question is a bit unclear.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review contains several claims. It states that the framework's relevance is questionable due to issues like duality gaps and non-norm constraints. It also suggests that using the true mean might not provide better defenses. \n\nAre these claims supported by evidence? The reviewer is pointing out potential problems but isn't providing specific references or logical reasoning to back these claims. It's more of an opinion rather than a well-supported claim. \n\nTherefore, the verifiability is **Unverifiable** because the claims lack sufficient justification or evidence to support them.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review raises several important points about the framework's limitations and potential uses.

It doesn't specify what exactly to mention or how to do it. So, it's not explicit because it's a suggestion without clear steps. It's also not concrete because it doesn't tell the author how to implement this change. Therefore, it's somewhere between explicit and implicit.

The review mentions \"these algorithms follow the sampled policy for awhile.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. The author might not know exactly where to look, so the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. The specificity is also low because it's not explaining what's wrong or what needs to be addressed. So, this is weakly grounded and not specific. That would be a 2 for grounding specificity.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim because it suggests an improvement. It says the algorithms should mention the sampled policy.

It mentions that some datasets are large, so not all algorithms can be used. The authors provided a repository and platform for reproducibility and clarified that datasets are novel. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives a clear action or suggests something specific. The review points out a potential issue with the number of datasets and mentions that some are large, which affects algorithm applicability. It also suggests providing a repository and clarifying dataset novelty. This seems like an explicit action because it directly tells the authors what to do. It doesn't ask them to do something vague like \"improve your methods\" but rather specifies steps like creating a repository. So, it's explicit and concrete. Therefore, it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions specific numbers of datasets (5,6,4) and refers to the size of some datasets. It also talks about providing a repository and clarifying dataset novelty. The authors are addressing specific aspects of their work, so the grounding is clear. They're not just talking about the paper in general but about specific datasets and their sizes. The specificity is good because they're pointing out exact issues. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review makes a claim that having a certain number of datasets might not be enough, especially with large datasets affecting algorithm applicability. It also mentions providing a repository and clarifying dataset novelty.

They mention the specific comparison missing but don't tell the authors what exactly to do. So this is weak grounding because they can't pinpoint the exact issue, and they don't clearly specify what needs to be addressed.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim that the paper lacks sufficient experimental demonstration. It's a claim because it's an opinion or judgment about the paper's contribution. Now, is this justified? The reviewer suggests adding a comparison, which is a logical reasoning step. They're implying that without this, the contribution isn't proven, which is a valid point. So it's somewhat justified but lacks specific references. Maybe it's somewhat verifiable because they provide a logical explanation but not concrete examples or references.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment points out a significant weakness\u2014the missing comparison. It suggests an important improvement needed. However, it's vague on what exactly should be added. The authors would need to infer what experiment to conduct, which isn't very helpful. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue, but it's not detailed enough to guide them fully.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is explicit but not concrete, has weak grounding, is somewhat verifiable, and is somewhat helpful. So the scores would reflect these observations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The comment explicitly states the issue but is vague on how to fix it, making it implicit.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3: Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The comment identifies a specific part of the paper (lack of comparison) but doesn't clearly specify what needs fixing, leading to weak grounding.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3: Weakly Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The comment contains a claim that is supported by logical reasoning but lacks specific references or examples.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3: Somewhat Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The comment identifies a significant issue but is vague on the solution, making it somewhat helpful.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3: Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

Better to use different notation to avoid confusion.\" It suggests using different notation, which is an explicit action. But does it give clear instructions on how to implement this? No, it just recommends changing notation but doesn't specify what to replace D with or how to adjust the dilation factor. So it's explicit but not concrete. That would make it borderline actionable because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions D in the context of dimensionality and dilation. It doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper D is referring to. The mention is vague, so the grounding is weak. Also, it doesn't explain what needs fixing about D, so specificity is lacking. This makes it weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion to use different notation, which is a claim. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's unverifiable. The claim is made without supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

The authors won't get much guidance from this comment.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is explicit but lacks concrete details (actionability: borderline), doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper (grounding: weakly grounded and not specific), doesn't back up the suggestion (verifiability: unverifiable), and is too vague to be helpful (helpfulness: barely helpful).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review explicitly states the need to change notation but does not provide concrete details on how to implement this change, making it borderline actionable.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The review does not clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed, resulting in weak grounding, and does not specify what needs fixing, leading to a lack of specificity.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The review contains a claim (suggestion to use different notation) but does not provide any justification or references, making it unverifiable.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The review offers a suggestion but lacks detailed explanations or references, making it barely helpful.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

It mentions that \"elements\" might be states, actions, or something else. The reviewer suggests adding more details. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is asking for clarification, which is a direct action. But the instruction is a bit vague\u2014whether \"elements\" are states or actions isn't clear. So, it's implicit because the reviewer isn't giving a direct instruction on how to proceed. Therefore, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3/5 because it's somewhat explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper, line 186-187, so that's good grounding. They're clearly referring to a specific section. Now, how specific is the comment? The reviewer is asking whether \"elements\" are states or actions and wants more elaboration. This is specific to that part of the paper, so the grounding is solid. But the specificity of the comment is about the content, not the section. The reviewer is asking a question about the content, which is specific to the concept. So, it's weakly specific because it's about the content rather than the section. Maybe a 4/5 because it's grounded but not very specific in content.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that \"elements\" could be states or actions. They're asking for clarification, which is a claim. Is there supporting evidence? The reviewer is just asking a question, so there's no justification or references. It's unclear if this is based on common knowledge or external references. So, it's not verifiable. Maybe a 1/5 because there's no justification provided.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific area for improvement and asking clarifying questions. This is somewhat helpful because it identifies an area for improvement. However, the questions are vague and don't provide concrete suggestions. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

It's explicit about the action, which is to provide more detail. But it's vague on what exactly needs to be detailed\u2014like specific components or methods.

The comment mentions channel and spatial attention but doesn't specify which parts of the paper or sections of the methodology or results they should be detailed.

The reviewer also asks for a baseline comparison. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with RBI's training focus. They're suggesting a possible improvement by comparing FP + RBI to RBI alone. However, the suggestion is a bit vague. The reviewer doesn't specify exactly how they plan to implement this or what changes would be made. It's more of an idea than a concrete action. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because they do suggest an action, but it's not very detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about RBI training only on rewarded actions and mentions that rewardless actions with useful supervision are ignored. They also ask for a baseline. \n\nIs this well-grounded? The reviewer is referring to the specific training focus of RBI and the potential issue with ignoring other supervision. They mention \"rewardless actions\" and \"useful supervision,\" which are specific aspects. However, when they ask for a baseline, it's a bit vague.

The review says that the multi-scale statement is misleading because the RNNs operate on logical time scales, not physical ones. It mentions the benefit of reduced gradient paths by the slow RNN. This seems like an explicit action because it directly points out the issue and suggests a benefit. The rationale is that the reviewer is clearly indicating a problem and providing a solution, so it's actionable. I think this should be a 5 because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions the logical time scale and the benefit of the slow RNN. They don't explicitly name the section or part of the paper, but they do clearly identify the issue and the solution. So, it's fully grounded because they can pinpoint the part being addressed, even if it's not by name. The specificity is good because they explain what's wrong and what the benefit is. I'd rate this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the RNNs operate on logical time scales, which is a clear claim. They back this up by explaining that the stacks are sequentialized in the graph, which is a logical reasoning. They also mention the benefit of reduced gradient paths, which is a well-known concept, so it's supported by external knowledge. This should be a 5 because the evidence is strong and logical.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

It mentions that the author's initial idea was to take random weights, learn curves between them, and mix nice weights into an ensemble. But it wasn't like that. The comment suggests that it could work but is computationally demanding. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a weakness but doesn't specify what needs to be done. They mention that the author's approach was different from what was imagined but don't provide clear steps on how to fix it. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit comment, which might be helpful but lacks direction. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about the connections between two parts of the method. They mention the author's initial idea but don't clearly identify which specific part of the paper they're referring to.

It says the paper should discuss this. Is this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors to discuss their method in relation to others. But does it give specific actions? It just says \"discuss,\" which is a bit vague.

So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions specific methods like Voronoi graphs and SLAM techniques. It says \"discussed in the graph-based SLAM appendix section.\" That's pretty specific because it points to a particular section of the paper. So, the authors can pinpoint where to look for more details. The specificity is good because it tells them exactly what's being referred to. I'd give this a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** score.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting that the proposed method is similar to existing ones. It provides references like the appendix section, which adds credibility. The justification is there, so it's well-supported. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out that the paper should discuss its method in relation to others.

It points out that the previous framework isn't limited to raw-level selection and mentions representation learning in the appendix. The reviewer suggests improving the feature selection with representation learning. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is suggesting an improvement but doesn't specify exactly how to implement it. They mention considering representation learning but don't provide a clear method. So, it's implicit because the authors have to infer how to apply it. Since it's not explicit, it's not highly actionable. Maybe a 3 or 4? But since it's implicit, I think 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about Section 4.2 and mentions the previous framework, referencing lines 167-174. They also point out representation learning in the appendix. The reviewer is accurately pinpointing specific sections and clearly indicating what's wrong. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer suggests considering representation learning but doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning. They're making a judgment about the benefits of representation learning but lack justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable because they have a basis in their judgment, but it's not fully supported. Maybe a 3: Somewhat Verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer provides a clear suggestion to improve feature selection by considering representation learning.

It's explicit because it tells the author what's missing. But it's vague because it doesn't give specific steps or examples on how to design the rewards. So, it's not concrete. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement the action.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions \"how to design the rewards\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly this information should be addressed. It's unclear which section or figure the author is referring to. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint the exact part of the paper being addressed. The specificity about the missing details is also lacking because it doesn't clearly explain what's missing or how it affects the paper.

It's not just any limitation but specifically about runtime. Also, it mentions the large parameter count, which is a specific aspect of the model. So the grounding is strong here. It clearly identifies the part of the paper and what's wrong with it. So I'd give it a 5.\n\nVerifiability. The review makes a claim that ML emulators are computationally cheap, which is a general statement. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's not verifiable. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review offers a suggestion about runtime but doesn't provide any data or examples to back it up. It's vague on how the runtime affects applications or what the alternatives are. Without concrete evidence, the feedback isn't very helpful for the authors. So I'd rate it as 2.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

The comment is asking about the grid search of learning rate on the validation set. It mentions the validation set, which is a specific part of the paper. However, it's just a question and doesn't explain why this is important or what the implications are. So, it's **3: Somewhat Grounded** because it does identify the section but doesn't elaborate on the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a question, which is a normal statement. There's no claim or suggestion being made, so it doesn't require verification. Therefore, it's **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

The review point is asking about the diversity of the sample, specifically racial and economic diversity, and how well the results might generalize to other groups, especially marginalized ones. It's a good question, but is it actionable? The comment is asking a question, which is a common way to prompt discussion, but it doesn't give a specific action. So, the authors would need to figure out how to address this themselves. That makes it somewhat vague. So, I think this is Borderline Actionable because it's not giving a direct instruction but is still relevant.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions \"racial, economic diversity\" and \"marginalized groups.\" It's pretty specific about what's being addressed\u2014those exact aspects of the sample. It doesn't just say \"diversity\" but pinpoints the type of diversity and the groups to consider. So, this should be Fully Grounded because it accurately identifies the sections being discussed.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a judgment about the generalizability of the results. It's suggesting that the authors consider how well their findings apply to other groups. This is a claim because it's an opinion or judgment. Now, is this justified? The comment doesn't provide any specific references or reasoning to back up the generalizability claim. It's just a suggestion without evidence. So, it's Unverifiable because there's no supporting justification.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review is asking a question about the sample's diversity and generalizability. While it's relevant, it's quite open-ended. The authors might not know how to proceed with this feedback. It doesn't provide specific actions or references, so it's not very helpful.

The reviewer feels this affects the validity of the approach. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the comment gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a specific issue with the dataset size but doesn't suggest any changes or improvements. So, it's more of a statement than an action. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 1 for Actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment mentions 20 images in each of 4 categories. The reviewer is clearly pointing to a specific part of the dataset, so the grounding is strong because it's specific. They also explain why they feel the number is small, which adds clarity. So, this should be a high score. I'll give it a 5 here.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is making a claim that 20 images are insufficient. They back this up by stating their opinion on the impact on validity. There's a clear justification, so this is well-verified.

It mentions figure captions lacking explanations, like colors in Fig. 2. It also says the figures didn't help much and needed to be read multiple times. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer suggests more explanations and better figure captions, which are clear actions. But the problem is, the reviewer doesn't specify exactly what to add\u2014like maybe more text or clearer legends. So, it's explicit that they want explanations but vague on how to implement it. That makes it borderline actionable because the action is clear, but the method isn't detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer points out specific parts: figure captions and the figures themselves. They mention colors in Fig. 2, which is very specific.

It's fully grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is making claims about the paper being hard to follow and needing specific changes. These are opinions and suggestions, so they're claims. The justification is that more intuitive explanations and better figure captions would help.

It's too vague about the part of the paper being addressed. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly point to a specific section or element. It's just a general concern without pinpointing the issue. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific, which would be a 2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting that hyperparameter sensitivity is a crucial issue.

It doesn't specify which part of the model or setting it's referring to. It's a general question, so the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the issue. Also, it's not specific about what needs to be addressed. So, this would be Weakly Grounded and Not Specific (2).\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is asking if the approach can be extended. This is a subjective opinion, so it's a claim. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a guess, so it's Unverifiable (1).\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is asking a question without providing any actionable feedback. It doesn't help the authors improve their work because it's vague and doesn't offer specific suggestions. So, it's Not Helpful at All (1).\n\nI think that's all.

Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. Here, the comment is asking for more information, which is a good start. However, it's quite vague. The user doesn't specify what they need, like the name of the extractor or why it's important. So, it's explicit in asking for information but lacks detail on how to apply it. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear what's needed but not how to proceed.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is pointing to a specific line in the paper, line 201, so the grounding is strong because it's directly referencing a part of the paper. The specificity is about how well the issue is detailed. The comment is asking about the feature extractor, which is a specific aspect of the methodology. It's clear what part is being addressed, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a question asking for clarification, not a claim. Since it's a factual statement without a claim, it falls under \"X\" for verifiability. There's no evidence or reasoning provided, so it's not verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is asking for which feature extractor was used. While it's helpful in prompting the authors to provide more details, it doesn't directly suggest improvements or identify weaknesses.

The review says there's insufficient analysis of data augmentation methods and suggests comparing to EDA or LLM-based methods. It's explicit about the need for analysis and comparison, so that's good. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to perform this analysis or what specific aspects to focus on. So it's explicit but vague. I think this would be a **Borderline Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions specific references, like [1] and [2], which are well-known works. It clearly states what needs to be addressed, comparing their method to others. So the grounding is strong because it references specific sections and provides clear instructions on what to do. I'd rate this as **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests comparing to other methods but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references beyond the ones already mentioned. It's making a claim that their method is better but isn't backing it up with data or logical reasoning.

The review points out a significant issue (insufficient analysis) and suggests a solution (comparing to other methods). It's clear and actionable, which is helpful for the authors.

That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. Maybe a 3 or 4? Hmm, since it's vague on how to apply, I think 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review talks about MMD and knowledge distillation, but it doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's more general, so the grounding is weak.

The review mentions specific aspects like other architectures and scalability, which are clearly tied to the FMN. It doesn't just refer to the paper by name but also to the concept of FMN. The specificity is high because it's not just pointing out a problem but also asking about scalability, which is a detailed aspect.

The reviewer is asking about considering documents as sentences and handling entity mentions. They're not giving a specific instruction on what to do, just asking questions. So, it's more of a suggestion than a direct action. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable because they're prompting, but not giving explicit instructions. So, I'd rate this as 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer is asking about how the documents are treated as sentences and how entity mentions are handled. They're referring to the methods used in DocRED, which is specific. So, the grounding is strong because they're pointing to a specific part of the paper, likely the methods section.

So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. Therefore, Grounding Specificity would be 1.\n\nMoving on to Verifiability. The comment is asking why mean pooling works and what other strategies exist. It's a claim because it's making a judgment about the current method and suggesting other strategies. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just posing questions without supporting evidence. So, it's somewhat unverifiable. I'd give it a 2 for Verifiability.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The comment is asking for more information and alternative strategies but doesn't provide any concrete suggestions or references. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much. So, it's not very helpful. I'd rate this as 2 for Helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a score based on how well the review point provides clear, specific, and justifiable feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review point does not explicitly state an action or provide guidance on how to improve the pooling approach.

Or only trained on the 88,635 images from the Computer Vision Figures dataset.\" The action here is asking a question, which is an explicit action. However, it's not giving a direct instruction on what to do. It's more of a clarifying question, so it's implicit. Since it's implicit, it's less actionable because the author doesn't know exactly what to do next. So, I think this is borderline actionable because it's asking for information but not giving a clear step-by-step action.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions \"the VQGAN\" and \"the Computer Vision Figures dataset.\" That's pretty specific. It's not just a vague comment about missing details but specifically points to the model and dataset. So, this should be fully grounded because it accurately identifies the parts being referred to.\n\nVerifiability. The review is asking a question, which is a claim. It's suggesting that the VQGAN is either pre-trained or trained on a specific dataset. To verify this, the authors would need to check the original paper or provide evidence. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's a claim that can be supported with references or evidence, but it's not fully verifiable without more details.\n\nHelpfulness. The review is asking a question to get information about the training of the model. It's helpful because it directs the authors to look into specific aspects of their model. However, it's not providing a solution or suggestion, just a question. So, it's somewhat helpful because it does provide a direction for the authors to improve their work, but it's not as helpful as a suggestion that tells them what to do.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable) because it's an explicit question but lacks detail on how to proceed.\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific) because it clearly references specific parts.\n- Verifiability: 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) because it's a claim that can be supported but needs more evidence.\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful) because it guides the authors to check specific details but doesn't provide a solution.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review points out missing training details by asking a clarifying question, which is an explicit action but lacks specific guidance on what to do next.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The review explicitly mentions 'the VQGAN' and 'the Computer Vision Figures dataset,' providing clear references, making it fully grounded and specific.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The review poses a claim about the training details of the VQGAN, which can be somewhat verified with references but lacks detailed evidence.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The review is somewhat helpful as it directs the authors to investigate specific training aspects, providing a clear direction for improvement.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It doesn't tell the authors exactly where to add these references or how to integrate them. That means the authors still have to figure out the implementation details themselves. So, it's not explicit, and the action isn't very concrete. I think this is borderline actionable because it does suggest an action but doesn't provide clear guidance on how to apply it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions specific works by Li et al. and He et al. It clearly states which parts of the paper should be compared, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where to add these references. That's full grounding because it accurately identifies the sections. The specificity is good because it tells the authors exactly what comparisons to make, so this is highly specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting that including these works would be beneficial. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why these specific works are relevant or how they relate to the current research. There's no logical reasoning or references, so this is unverifiable. The claim is there, but there's no support, making it not helpful in terms of verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review does suggest adding comparisons, which is helpful, but it's vague. It doesn't explain why these comparisons are important or how they would improve the work. The authors would need to do more research on their own to understand the relevance.

The review says that DualIS and DualDIS aren't generic in some cross-model retrieval tasks, specifically mentioning MSVD in Table 3 with minor improvements. Is this an explicit action? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a limitation but not suggesting what to do. So, it's not explicit because it's just stating a fact without giving a clear next step.

It says that each learner class should be considered individually, even in a BDT of different depths. The rationale here is that varying the PMF would add depth, but the reviewer is also asking the authors to consider if this is a good idea, which is a bit vague.

It's making the author clarify these aspects. Is this explicit or implicit? Well, the author is being asked to provide more information, which is a direct action. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is not just asking for more details but also specifying what kind of details are needed. They want to know if theta is finite, continuous, or something else, and what actions are being considered. This gives the author clear instructions on how to improve their work. So it's concrete.

It also points out that this is acknowledged by the authors in Section 3, making the results from Theorem 1 inapplicable. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out an issue but isn't directly telling the authors what to do. They're indicating a problem but not providing a specific action. So, it's implicit. Since it's implicit, the authors still don't know exactly how to fix it. Therefore, it's not actionable because they need more guidance on what changes to make.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer refers to Section 3, which the authors acknowledge. That's pretty specific because they mention the exact section. However, the reviewer doesn't specify what needs to be changed in that section. They just point out that the results are inapplicable. So, while it's grounded, it's not specific about the issue within Section 3. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is making a judgment that the proof technique has a limitation when matrix norms approach infinity. They're suggesting that the authors should adjust their results since Theorem 1 doesn't apply. This is a claim because it's an opinion or judgment about the paper. Now, is this justified? The reviewer references Section 3, which the authors acknowledge, implying that the grounding is there. However, the justification is vague because they don't provide specific examples or references. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a reference, but it's not detailed enough.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer points out a limitation in the proof technique but doesn't provide concrete suggestions on how to adjust the results or where exactly the issue lies in Section 3. They're leaving the authors to figure it out on their own, which might not be helpful.

The reviewer is making a direct comparison between two tasks and pre-training methods. They're suggesting that one is better than the other, which is an explicit action.

Well, the reviewer is pointing out a potential limitation and asking for clarification. It's a good question, but it's more of a probing nature.

It mentions that the paraphrase similarity view does better but lacks analysis on how other views differ. The reviewer suggests an example but doesn't go into detail. So, the action here is pointing out a lack of understanding, but it's vague. It doesn't tell the author what to do next, like how to analyze the views or what techniques to use. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which makes it borderline actionable because it's vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about the paraphrase similarity view performing better but doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. They give an example with the word 'slip' but don't clearly identify where else this might apply. So, the grounding is weak because it's not precisely pointing out the section or unique aspect. The specificity is low because it's not clearly explaining what needs improvement.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that other views aren't well understood. They back this up by saying the example is one and that more analysis is needed. This provides some justification, so it's somewhat verifiable.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point is asking about the size of the model, specifically the number of hourglass modules and their size. It mentions 4 modules but doesn't specify how big each is. Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. \n\nLooking at the definitions, an explicit action would be if the reviewer had suggested adding or removing something. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a missing detail. That's an explicit statement, so it's not vague. But is it concrete? The reviewer isn't telling the authors exactly what to do, just pointing out that the size isn't mentioned. So, it's explicit but not concrete because they don't know what to do next. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is talking about the model's size, which is a specific part of the paper. They mention the number of modules, which is a clear reference. So, the grounding is strong because they're pointing to a specific section. Then, they're asking about the size, which is specific. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific** because they clearly identify the part and what needs addressing.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting that the model size isn't adequately discussed. The reviewer is making a judgment that the size is important. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a potential omission, but they don't provide evidence or reasoning. They just state that the size isn't mentioned. So, there's no justification or references, making it **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a missing detail, which is a weakness. It suggests the authors should consider discussing the model size, which is helpful. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how or why the size matters. It's a good suggestion but lacks depth. So, this should be **Somewhat Helpful** because it identifies an issue but doesn't provide enough guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own rationale and score based on how well the review point addresses each criterion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review point explicitly states that the model size is not mentioned, which is an explicit action.

The review references a specific paper [Bartlett et al. (2017)] which is good because it points to an external source.

The question is about the number of physical interactions, which is a specific aspect of the simulation. However, it doesn't provide any guidance on what the authors should do next.

These are all explicit actions the authors can take. The reviewer doesn't just point out the problem but also suggests possible solutions like considering a set-oriented approach or dimensionality reduction. So, this is explicit and concrete. It's not implicit because the reviewer isn't just pointing out the issue but also giving clear directions on how to fix it. Therefore, it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about the item-oriented autoencoder, the element-wise function, and the number of hidden units. These are all specific parts of the paper. They don't make any educated guesses; instead, they directly reference the components mentioned in the paper. So, the grounding is full because the reviewer accurately identifies the sections being addressed. The specificity is also high because they clearly explain what's wrong with each part.

The review mentions not using specific fairness metrics, which is explicit. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do, like suggesting using EO or providing specific metrics. It also gives a vague suggestion to conduct more experiments on certain datasets without specifics. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what steps to take. Maybe it's borderline actionable since it does point out the issue but doesn't give clear instructions.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about fairness metrics and datasets.

The authors can identify where the problem lies and what needs improvement. So, grounding specificity is probably high here.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review suggests using EO and cites a paper. Verifiability requires that claims are supported by evidence.

Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment is pointing out a problem but doesn't specify what to do about it. It's vague because it doesn't give concrete steps or where exactly the change should be made. So, it's not explicit because it's just stating the issue without a clear action.

The comment is making a judgment that the section is speculative or opinionated and suggests moving it elsewhere. It's a claim because it's making a judgment about the content.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review point is asking about the impact of imperfect multimodal data on the model. It's a bit vague because it's asking about higher-order interactions and whether the model can infer missing modalities. The action suggested is to consider whether missing data causes compounding effects or if other modalities can help infer the missing ones. But this is more of a thought process rather than a direct action the authors can take. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an exploration question, which doesn't give clear steps for improvement. Therefore, it's probably **1: Unactionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review point doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's too broad, just asking about the model's behavior without pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint where the issue lies. It's not fully grounded either. Since it's not clearly pointing to a specific part, it's **1: Not Grounded**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review point is making a claim about the model's behavior when data is imperfect. However, it's not supported by any evidence or references. It's more of a speculative question rather than a claim that's backed up. So, it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

It's not fully grounded because it's too vague about what needs fixing.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment talks about ablation studies but doesn't provide evidence or references.

It seems like a statement pointing out a deficiency, so it's a claim. Now, is the action explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a lack of ablation analysis, which is a specific part of the paper.

The reviewer is suggesting that the authors should perform an ablation study, which is a clear action. They also specify what to do, which is to add an ablation analysis. So, this is highly actionable because it's explicit and gives a direct instruction.\n\nMoving on to **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions \"the lack of ablation analysis (in the main paper)\" which clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being referred to. So, the grounding is fully grounded because it accurately points to the ablation analysis section. Additionally, the comment specifies what the issue is, which is the difficulty in pinpointing the source of performance gain. Therefore, the specificity is also high because it clearly states the problem.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that there's a lack of ablation analysis. This claim is supported by the fact that ablation analysis is a standard practice in machine learning studies. Therefore, the reasoning is logical and well-supported by common knowledge. So, this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out a clear issue and suggesting a solution.

So, it's explicit but vague on the details. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because the action is clear, but the implementation isn't detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review points out a specific existing work that uses KG with text, so it's clearly identifying the part of the paper being addressed. It also mentions adding negations or changing entities, which are specific modifications. Therefore, it's **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it pinpoints the section and clearly states what needs to be done.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting a comparison. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for why this analysis would be useful. It just states the idea without backing it up. So, it's **Unverifiable** because there's no reasoning or references provided to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment is pointing out a relevant existing work and suggesting a comparison, which could be helpful. However, it's quite vague about how to conduct the analysis. Without more specifics, the authors might not know how to proceed, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

The review says, \"For clarity, consider explaining a bit more how novel values in the test set are handled.\" The action here is suggesting the authors explain more about handling novel test set values. Is this explicit? Yes, it's a direct suggestion. Now, is it concrete? The review doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done, like whether they should provide examples or a detailed explanation. So it's not very detailed. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable because the action is clear, but the specifics are missing. So I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"how novel values in the test set are handled.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a particular section or figure. So the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The specificity about what needs to be explained is clear, but without a reference, it's not fully grounded.

Now, looking at the definitions, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. \n\nThe review mentions specific values (0.6, k-cross-validation) and suggests alternative loss functions.

The review refers to glove embeddings and loss functions without mentioning specific sections or tables.

It suggests ensuring the baseline is fully tuned with similar resources for a fair comparison. \n\nFor actionability, it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment mentions hyperparameters like temperature, penalty, and threshold, which are specific, so that's good. It also suggests a resource-intensive tuning, which is an action. However, it's a bit vague on how exactly to implement this tuning. They don't specify methods or tools, so it's not super detailed. That might make it a bit less actionable.

Yes, they're directly stating what perplexity is, which is a clear action. Then, they're explaining that Eq1 is cross-entropy, which gives a concrete action for the authors to check their equation.

It mentions that the methods should be described in Section 4.1. Is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't suggesting exactly how to fix it. So, it's implicit. Since it's not giving clear steps, it's not actionable. So, this should be a low score, maybe 1 or 2.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer is pointing out a lack of details in a specific section. They mention Section 4.1, which is specific. So, the grounding is strong because they're pointing to a particular part. But the comment itself is vague about what needs to be added. It doesn't specify how to describe the implementation details. So, it's grounded but not specific. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim that there's a lack of details. But it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without backing.

The review says there's no empirical evaluation, no comparison, and it's unclear what practical value the contribution has. It mentions that even a theoretical paper should argue why it matters, which isn't done here. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the review gives explicit or implicit actions. The review is pointing out several issues but isn't suggesting specific changes. It's more of a critique without clear guidance on what to do next. So, it's not explicit because it's not telling the authors exactly what to do. It's also not concrete because it doesn't explain how to improve the paper. Therefore, it's somewhere between 2 and 3 on the actionability scale. Since it's vague and doesn't provide clear steps, I think it's a **Borderline Actionable** score.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions that the paper lacks empirical evaluation and comparison, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper is affected. It's talking about the paper in general, not pointing to a specific section or figure. Also, it doesn't explain what's wrong with the contribution. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. The specificity is also low because it's not detailing what needs fixing. Therefore, this should be **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review is making a claim that the paper lacks empirical evaluation and that its contribution's practical value is unclear. It's suggesting that the paper isn't suitable for NeurIPS. To verify this claim, the review doesn't provide any evidence or justification. It's just stating an opinion without backing it up. So, it's not verifiable because there's no support for the claim. This would be a **1: Unverifiable** score.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out several issues but isn't providing clear, actionable feedback. It's vague and doesn't suggest specific changes. While it's helpful in pointing out problems, it lacks the depth and clarity needed to be fully helpful.

It mentions combining RL and planning has been done in PRM-RL and suggests applying it elsewhere. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a limitation but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be changed. So, it's implicit. Since it's not directly telling the authors what to do, it's not actionable. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about navigation problems and mentions PRM-RL. They're specific about the application area and citing a reference. So, they've clearly identified the part of the paper and provided specifics. That's good grounding. Also, they're specific about suggesting applications beyond navigation, so that's under specificity. I think this gets a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that combining RL and planning has been done in PRM-RL. They're suggesting it can be applied elsewhere. This requires justification, like explaining why it's relevant or citing evidence. They did mention the reference, so it's somewhat justified.

So, it's fully grounded in the model's architecture but not specific about the fix. That would be **Fully Grounded and Specific** (5) because it clearly points to a part of the paper, but it's a bit vague on the solution.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment states a fact about how the model works based on the equation. It doesn't provide any justification or references. So, it's just a factual statement without supporting evidence. That would be **Unverifiable** (1) because there's no reasoning or references backing up the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment points out a limitation but doesn't suggest how to address it or provide any guidance on improvement. It's more of a factual observation without actionable advice. So, it's **Not Helpful at All** (1) because it doesn't help the authors improve their work beyond pointing out a feature.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

It also points out that the main idea and automation process aren't clear. So, the reviewer is giving feedback but not specifying exactly what the authors should do. They're pointing out issues but not giving clear steps on how to fix them. That makes it a bit vague. So, I think this is borderline actionable because the reviewer is indicating a problem, but without clear instructions on how to address it.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer talks about the main contribution being unclear and the method's properties not being well-supported. They also mention the main idea and automation process not being clear. This means the reviewer is trying to pinpoint specific areas in the paper that need improvement. They're not just making a general statement but are trying to direct the authors to specific parts.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review says, \"the word 'confident' threw me off a little here, as I was not sure if this is about model confidence or human interpretability. I suspect the latter, but some slight rephrasing would be great.\" \n\nThe comment is suggesting that the term \"confident\" is unclear, which could refer to either model confidence or human interpretability. The reviewer is pointing this out and offering a suggestion to rephrase. \n\nNow, looking at the **Explicit vs. Implicit** criteria for actionability. The reviewer is pointing out a problem (unclear term) and suggesting a change. That's an explicit action because they're directly addressing the issue and providing a solution. \n\nNext, **Concrete vs. Vague**. The reviewer isn't just saying the term is unclear; they're also offering a specific solution to rephrase it. So the action is concrete because it's not just identifying the problem but also providing a clear next step. \n\nSo for **Actionability**, it's 5 because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nMoving on to **Grounding Specificity**. The comment is about the term \"confident\" being unclear. The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue in the paper, so that's fully grounded. They're also clearly specifying what's wrong (unclear term) and what needs to be done (rephrase). So it's fully grounded and specific, making it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting a change or improvement. The reviewer is claiming that the term is unclear and that rephrasing is needed. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is making a judgment about the clarity of the term, which is a subjective opinion. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided to back this up. So it's not verifiable because it's a judgment without justification. Therefore, it's a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out an issue and suggesting a solution. It's clear and actionable. They're helping the author by clarifying the term and providing a constructive suggestion. This is helpful, but maybe it could be more detailed. However, it's still highly helpful because it's clear and actionable. So I'd give it a 5.\n\nWait, but the original review said the term is unclear and suggested rephrasing. That's a clear and actionable suggestion, so it's helpful. Maybe I was too hasty with verifiability. Let me double-check. The claim is that the term is unclear, which is a judgment. Without evidence or reasoning, it's not verifiable. So yes, it's a 1 for verifiability.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n- Actionability: 5 (explicit and concrete)\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (fully grounded and specific)\n- Verifiability: 1 (claim without support)\n- Helpfulness: 5 (clear and actionable)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The reviewer explicitly states the issue with the term 'confident' and provides a concrete solution to rephrase it, making the action clear and direct.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The reviewer accurately identifies the specific issue with the term 'confident' and clearly specifies the needed rephrasing, fully grounding and detailing the issue.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The reviewer makes a claim about the term being unclear but lacks supporting evidence or justification, making the verifiability low.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The reviewer provides a clear and actionable suggestion to rephrase the unclear term, offering significant help to the author.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

I think this is 5 because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions SimCLR, which is a specific external work.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions referencing Zemel et al. (2013) and explaining how the current paper is different, with comparisons in simulations. It suggests making comparisons more systematic by comparing the best performance of each method. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability has two criteria: explicitness and concreteness. The review does mention specific work and differences, which is explicit. However, the suggestion to compare best performances is somewhat vague. It tells the authors what to do but doesn't specify exactly how to implement it. So, it's explicit but not very concrete. That would make it **Somewhat Actionable** (3).\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review references Zemel et al. (2013) and talks about comparisons. It doesn't explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, just that comparisons are made. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or element. But it does clearly specify what needs to be addressed, which is comparisons. So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** (3).\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting comparisons. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's not verifiable. It's just a suggestion without support, so it's **Unverifiable** (1).\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

Is this explicit or implicit? It seems explicit because it's a direct instruction. Now, is it concrete? The comment doesn't tell the authors exactly how to estimate it or how to apply it. So, it's explicit but vague. That would make it 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment mentions time complexity but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where it's discussed. It's just a general suggestion. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or figure. It's not grounded at all, so I'd give it 1: Not Grounded.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that estimating time complexity proves scalability. Is this claim supported? Well, it's a logical claim because time complexity directly relates to scalability. The reasoning is clear, so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness.
