It suggests this might introduce noise. Now, is this an explicit action? The reviewer is pointing out a problem and providing an example, so it's explicit. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how to fix it or what changes to make. They just point out the issue and an example. So, it's explicit but vague. That would make it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about the average of all possible instantiations. They mention the vocabulary and the issue of only one being correct, which grounds the comment to the specific part of the paper. They also explain why this could introduce noise, which adds specificity. So, the grounding is strong because they clearly reference the HIERENC description and explain the problem. This would be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer provides an example of how the average introduces noise and explains it logically. They don't cite external references, but their reasoning is clear and logical.

Does this affect the underestimation of the performances?\" The comment is asking for clarification, which is a direct action. It's explicit because the reviewer is clearly stating that they need more information. It doesn't provide vague instructions, so it's not implicit. Therefore, it's explicit and concrete. Actionability should be 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is asking for clarification, but it's not pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's a general question about the selection process. The reviewer isn't referencing any section, table, or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the part being addressed. Specificity isn't an issue here since the question is broad. The grounding specificity score would be 1 because it's not grounded at all.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a question seeking clarification. There's no claim being made here; it's just a request for more information. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiability. So, it's an \"X\" with a score of 1 because it's not a claim and thus unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is asking for clarification, which is helpful in guiding the reviewer to provide more detailed feedback. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't directly address the reviewers' concerns. It's somewhat helpful because it does prompt a detailed response but isn't comprehensive.

It mentions that the data has syntactic information, which the authors might not be utilizing. The comment is explicit about the action of citing Li et al. (2019a) to make the description clearer. It also provides a specific suggestion, which is to mention the dataset earlier. This is clear and direct, so it's actionable. It doesn't seem vague or require the authors to infer anything. So, this should be a high score on actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review points out that the authors are using a subset of a specific dataset. It mentions Li et al. (2019a) earlier, which makes it clear which part of the paper is being addressed. The specificity is about clearly stating that they're using a subset and that the dataset is from Li et al. (2019a). This is grounded because it accurately identifies the source, and it's specific about the subset. So, this should be a high grounding_specificity score.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that the authors should cite a specific dataset. The justification is that the dataset is already available and that using a subset might be redundant. This is supported by common knowledge about dataset availability. So, the claim is well-justified, making it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review provides a clear critique and a specific suggestion to improve the manuscript. It helps the authors by pointing out a potential redundancy and offering a constructive improvement. This is very helpful because it directly addresses a possible issue and guides the authors on how to make their work more efficient.

It's a direct question, so it's explicit. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. They still need to figure out if they should consider waiting time. So it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points to Table 1 and asks a specific question about the average duration. It mentions a unique aspect (waiting time), so it's fully grounded. The specificity is good because it clearly asks about a specific part of the table.\n\nFor **Verifiability**: The comment is a claim that the average duration includes waiting time.

It mentions that these findings are consistent with previous studies. \n\nFirst, I check if the action is explicit. The reviewer is pointing out specific comparisons and mentions consistency with previous studies, which is a clear statement. So, it's explicit. Now, is the action concrete? The reviewer is telling the authors to interpret the results as per the text, but it doesn't specify exactly how to modify their draft. So, it's not very concrete. It's more of a statement of fact without actionable steps. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but lacks concreteness. So, I'd rate it as 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific comparisons between MOS-Q and GT Mel A for Chinese, and between Baseline and NVSB for both Chinese and English MOS-V. It also references previous studies. The grounding here is pretty specific because it's clearly pointing out the sections or aspects being compared and referencing prior work. So, the authors can easily identify the parts they need to address. This is fully grounded because it's specific and clear. The specificity is also high because it's not just stating a general observation but providing exact details. So, this would be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review states that these findings are consistent with previous studies. This provides some justification or reasoning to support the claims made. It's not a direct quote from a reference, but it's a logical reasoning that connects the current findings to prior work. So, it's somewhat verifiable. It doesn't cite specific external references, but it does provide a logical explanation. Therefore, I'd rate it as 4 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out specific comparisons and mentions consistency with previous studies. It gives the authors some insight into their results but doesn't specify how to improve their work. It's clear and provides context, which is helpful, but it's not offering actionable steps.

The action is clear: the authors should consider mentioning objects. It's not vague because it tells exactly what to do. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It just says \"objects here,\" which is a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where to focus their improvements.

It also points out issues with model comparisons and other details. Now, does this give the authors clear actions? It suggests improvements but doesn't specify what exactly to do. So, it's not explicit. It's more of a general critique without concrete steps.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions the main weaknesses are the experiments, which is good for a short paper but could be stronger. It points out the setting is only for extremely low-resource regimes, which is a valid point. It also notes that sentence classification is easier and suggests the augmentation method could be used on more NLP tasks. \n\nNow, looking at explicitness: the reviewer is making clear suggestions about the experiments, setting, and potential applications. That's explicit. For concreteness, it's not just stating the issues but also suggesting solutions, like using more tasks. So it's somewhat concrete. \n\nPutting it together, the review is explicit and provides clear suggestions, so it's **Somewhat Actionable**. I think a 4 makes sense here because it's clear but could be more detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about the low-resource setting, which is specific. They also mention sentence classification as an easier task, which is a specific point about the method's limitations. Additionally, they suggest the method could be used on more tasks, which is a general point but still relevant. \n\nSo, the reviewer is fully grounding the issues but only partially specific about the suggestions. That would be **Fully Grounded and Under-Specific**, maybe a 4 because it's fully grounded but the suggestions are a bit broad.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the experiments being weaker, the setting being limited, and the method's potential applications. Each of these could be supported by common knowledge or external references. For example, pointing out that sentence classification is easier is a logical justification. The suggestions about more tasks could be backed by examples from literature. So, it's **Mostly Verifiable** with a 4 because it's well-supported but could be more detailed.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer provides clear feedback on the experiments, the specific setting, and the potential of the method. They suggest areas for improvement and connections to other tasks, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague in terms of how exactly to improve the experiments or what specific data augmentations to use.

It seems like the reviewer is asking for specific details about who the experts are and how annotation differs. It's not giving a direct action, so it's more implicit.

It also talks about the gap in performance and contradicts a generalizability claim. Now, looking at the definitions, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The review does suggest looking into why noun performance is poor and mentions the gap, but it doesn't provide specific actions or solutions. It's more of a critique and observation without actionable steps. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what changes to make.

The review refers to noun performance, which is specific, and mentions the gap in clustering approaches, which is also specific. It doesn't make general comments or guess which parts are affected. So, the grounding is solid because it clearly points to the nouns and the specific comparison with other clustering methods. It's fully grounded because it accurately identifies the sections being discussed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the clustering approach isn't generalizable because performance isn't uniform. It supports this with the observation that the performance gap exists. However, the justification is a bit vague\u2014just stating the gap without specific references or logical reasoning.

The review says that the experimental comparisons aren't enough and suggests testing with wider backbones like MoCo and SimCLR. It's explicit about the action\u2014suggesting more experiments. But does it give concrete details? It mentions specific models like ResNet50 (2\u00d7) and (4\u00d7), which are concrete. So, it's both explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5 because it's clear and specific.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The comment refers to specific methods (MoCo, SimCLR) and specific models (ResNet50 with different depths). It accurately points out the sections where these are mentioned, so it's fully grounded. It also clearly specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the comparison. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the current experiments aren't enough and suggests additional comparisons. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up why wider backbones are necessary. It's a bit vague. So, I'd rate this a 3 because it's somewhat justified but lacks key elements like references or explanations.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out a weakness (insufficient comparisons) and suggests an improvement. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful.

The user is asking to illustrate the results of this term, but without pointing to a specific section or figure in the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. It's just mentioning the equation without specifics. Therefore, this would be 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The comment is making a suggestion about illustrating a specific part of the results. It's a claim because it's recommending a change. Now, is this claim well-supported? The suggestion is clear, but there's no justification or reasoning provided. It's just stating that illustrating the loss term would be beneficial. So, it's somewhat verifiable because the suggestion is there, but without backing, it's not fully justified. So, I'd give it a 3: Somewhat Verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment is asking the authors to illustrate a specific part of their results. This is a helpful suggestion because it directly points out an area that could improve the clarity of their paper. It's clear and actionable, so it should be helpful. I think this deserves a 4: Mostly Helpful because while it's helpful, it might not cover all possible areas where the loss term could be discussed, but it's still a solid suggestion.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own rationale and score based on how well the review point provides clear actions, grounds the reference, supports the claim, and helps the authors improve their work.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The comment suggests an action (illustrating the loss term) but does not provide explicit guidance on how to implement it, making it somewhat actionable.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3: Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The comment refers to Eqn 13 without specifying which part of the paper it relates to, making the grounding weak.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The comment presents a claim (suggestion to illustrate the loss term) but lacks justification or references, making it somewhat verifiable.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3: Somewhat Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The comment provides a clear suggestion to improve the paper's clarity by illustrating a specific part of the results, making it mostly helpful.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4: Mostly Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

The reviewer is pointing out issues but isn't telling the authors exactly what to do.

Is this explicit? Yes, it's telling the author what to do. Is it concrete? It says to remove the statements, so the author knows exactly what to do. So that's highly actionable. I think it should get a 5 here.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions semantic segmentation specifically, pointing out that it's per pixel. That's pretty specific. It's not just a vague comment about the paper; it's pinpointing a part. So I'd say fully grounded and specific, which is a 5.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim that semantic segmentation is a low-level cue, which is an opinion. It's supported by the reasoning that each pixel is specified, which is a logical explanation. So it's fully verifiable with solid evidence. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review clearly points out an issue and suggests a fix.

The review says that in the ablation experiment, performance without reinforcement learning dropped lower than without the dependency tree. It also mentions that two tables don't list cases where either dependency tree or RL are not used. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The comment points out a problem in the ablation experiments but doesn't specify how to fix it or what changes to make. It just states the issue. So, it's not explicit on actions, which makes it less actionable. It's more of a statement pointing out a problem without suggesting a solution. So, I think this is **2: Borderline Actionable** because it does hint at an issue but doesn't tell authors exactly what to do next.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions the ablation experiments and the two tables. It accurately points out that the tables don't include cases without dependency tree or RL. So, the grounding is clear because it correctly identifies the part of the paper being discussed. It's specific about the tables, so this should be **4: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review states that the performance dropped and that the tables are missing certain cases. There's no claim here; it's just stating facts. So, it's a normal statement without any justification or evidence. Therefore, it's **X: No Claim** because there's no claim or suggestion made, just observations.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out issues in the ablation experiments but doesn't provide solutions or suggest improvements. It's more of a critique without actionable advice.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review mentions that the authors consider a single vulnerability at a time, acknowledge data imbalance, and questions the ecological validity. It also points out that previous work considers multiple vulnerabilities. The reviewer is suggesting that the authors should either argue if single-vulnerability use is intended or provide more comprehensive results. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, the reviewer is directly pointing out that the authors should address whether their approach is intended or if they should consider multiple vulnerabilities. So that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is suggesting specific areas for the authors to focus on, like addressing ecological validity or comparing with previous work. They're not just saying \"improve the methodology,\" but rather pointing out specific aspects that need clarification or expansion. So, it's concrete because the reviewer is giving clear directions on what the authors should do.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions specific things like single vs. multiple vulnerabilities, data imbalance, and ecological validity. They're not just talking about the methodology in general but specifically pointing out these aspects. So the grounding is strong because the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the sections or issues the authors should address. The mention of previous work considering multiple vulnerabilities is a clear reference to a specific part of the literature, which helps the authors understand what's missing.\n\nMoving on to Verifiability. The reviewer is making a claim that the authors' approach is questionable, suggesting they should consider multiple vulnerabilities. The reviewer provides some reasoning, like pointing out previous work, but it's not very detailed. They mention data imbalance and ecological validity but don't go into specific examples or external references beyond that. So, while there's some justification, it's not thorough. Therefore, this is somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer is clearly pointing out issues with the authors' approach, suggesting improvements, and providing context by referencing previous studies. This is helpful because it guides the authors to think about their methodology's limitations and how it compares to existing work. However, the suggestions are somewhat vague, like asking whether the authors should consider multiple vulnerabilities, which is a bit open-ended. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is actionable and grounded, but the verifiability is only somewhat supported, and the helpfulness is moderate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The reviewer explicitly states that the authors should address whether their single-vulnerability approach is intended and suggests comparing with previous work, providing clear directions.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The reviewer specifically mentions single vs. multiple vulnerabilities, data imbalance, and ecological validity, accurately pinpointing areas for improvement.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The reviewer makes a claim about the methodology's questionable nature and provides some reasoning, such as referencing previous work, but lacks detailed examples or external references.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The reviewer provides clear feedback on the authors' approach, guiding them to consider their methodology's limitations and compare with existing studies, though the suggestions are somewhat vague.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It mentions that Theorem 1 and 2 show GCL's relationship with degree bias but it's not intuitive. I think this is an explicit action because it directly points out the need for more explanations. But is it concrete? It suggests adding explanations but doesn't specify how. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionable scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to Theorem 1 and 2, which are specific parts of the paper. It also mentions the relationship with degree bias, which is a specific aspect. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the theorems and the specific issue. That should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review talks about theorems proving something but doesn't provide specific references or examples.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review points out that the parameters in Table 1 were only tested on image data and ViT models, and suggests applying the same principles to other areas like NLP or simpler models like CNNs. The reviewer is asking for more specific actions, like providing examples or testing on different architectures. This seems explicit, so it's not implicit. However, the action is quite vague because it doesn't specify how to test these models or what metrics to use. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That would make it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer is pointing out a specific area in the paper\u2014the parameters in Table 1\u2014so that's clear. But the issue is that the parameters were only tested on image data and ViT, not other areas. The grounding here is explicit because it mentions the table and the models. However, the specificity is low because it's not clear what exactly needs to be changed or tested. So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the method might not generalize to other areas. This is a claim because it's an opinion. The justification is vague, just stating that it's unclear and suggesting simpler models. There's no concrete evidence or references provided, so it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is providing a critique and suggesting an improvement, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is quite broad and doesn't give specific examples or methods, so the authors might not know exactly how to proceed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review says that the required condition on the learning rate isn't scalable and that in practice, the step size doesn't grow with the sample size, leading to impractically large learning rates. It suggests the authors need a way to characterize the benefit of large learning rates but argues the condition isn't realistic.\n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a specific issue with the learning rate condition. They mention that in practice, the step size doesn't increase, which is a clear point. However, they don't provide explicit steps on how to modify the learning rate or suggest any solutions. So, it's not fully actionable because the reviewer is pointing out a problem but not giving a direct fix. Maybe they could have suggested a possible adjustment, but they didn't. So, I'd rate this as **Somewhat Actionable** because they did identify an issue, but it's vague on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about the learning rate condition not being scalable and mentions that in practice, the step size doesn't grow with the sample size. They also link this to impractically large learning rates on large datasets. \n\nIs this well-grounded? The reviewer references practical observations about step size not increasing with data size and the implications for large datasets. They're not just speculating; they're connecting it to real-world issues. So, they've accurately pinpointed the part of the paper that's being discussed, which means they've fully grounded the comment. Additionally, they're specific about the issue with scalability and the practical consequences. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer states that the required condition on the learning rate isn't scalable and that in practice, the step size doesn't grow with the sample size. They also argue that this condition isn't realistic.\n\nIs there a claim here? Yes, the reviewer is making a judgment about the condition's scalability and its impracticality in real scenarios. They're providing some reasoning but not extensive references or examples. They mention practical observations but don't cite specific literature. So, the claim is somewhat justified but lacks depth. Therefore, this should be **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer points out that the required condition isn't scalable and that in practice, the step size doesn't grow with the sample size, leading to impractically large learning rates. They suggest the authors need a way to precisely characterize the benefit of large learning rates but argue the condition isn't realistic.\n\nIs this helpful? The reviewer does identify a problem and suggests that the authors need to consider something, which is helpful.

It mentions minor language issues. Explicitly, it's pointing out a lack of detail. Is this explicit or implicit? It's explicit because it's directly stating what's missing. But is it concrete? It tells the authors where the problem is but doesn't give a clear solution or how to fix it. So it's somewhat actionable because it points out an issue, but it's vague on how to address it. So I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about the abstract lacking evaluation details. It doesn't mention specific parts of the paper, like sections or tables. It's just a general statement. So the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint where exactly the issue is. It's not fully grounded. Specificity isn't an issue here because it's not providing details on what needs fixing. So this would be 1: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the abstract lacks description and has minor language issues.

So, it's explicit in suggesting the action but not concrete on the implementation. That makes it **Borderline Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on how to do it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about epoch-wise analysis, which is a specific part of the paper. It mentions investigating certain parameters, which should be clearly identifiable.

It mentions that the current definitions are clear but the differentiation is difficult. It points to a specific instance and questions why it's classified one way or the other, asking about the exact regulation used. \n\nIs this explicit? The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue, so it's explicit. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't tell the authors exactly how to differentiate or what to do next. They just ask about the regulation and its impact. So, it's not very actionable because the authors still need to figure out which regulation applies or how to adjust their model. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete steps. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer refers to a specific instance and mentions local regulations, which the authors can identify. However, they don't clearly explain what's wrong with the instance or why it's classified that way. The mention of line 438-441 is a bit vague. The reviewer doesn't specify which regulation or how it affects the classification. So, while the part about the instance is grounded, the explanation isn't specific enough.

The comment is making a claim by suggesting the authors perform a specific analysis. To verify this, the authors would need to provide evidence or reasoning supporting why this analysis is necessary. The claim is that the graph will show whether performance improvement comes from network design or ImageNet. This is a judgment call, so it's a claim.

It's clear and directly instructs them on what to do. However, it doesn't elaborate on the benefits of adding the graph or how it affects the learning curve.

It would be valuable to discuss it and present your solutions in this paper. The citation seems a bit disordered.\" \n\nFirst, is this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is suggesting discussing different input types and presenting solutions, which is a clear action. But then they mention the citation being disordered. That's more of an implicit suggestion. So, it's partially actionable but not entirely explicit. \n\nNext, is it concrete? The reviewer is giving a general idea but not specific steps on how to fix the citation. So, it's not very concrete. I think this falls under borderline actionable because part of it is explicit, but the citation part is vague.\n\nMoving on to Grounding Specificity. The reviewer talks about different types of inputs like biomedical signals or speech. That's pretty specific because they're naming examples. Then, they mention the citation being disordered, which is a bit vague but still points to a specific part of the paper. So, I think this is fully grounded because they're pointing out a specific issue in the paper.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is making a claim by suggesting discussing different input types and presenting solutions. They also imply that the citation is disordered, which is a judgment. Now, is this claim verifiable? They're suggesting improvements but not providing specific references or reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable because they're making a judgment, but without supporting evidence, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe it's borderline verifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue with the citation and suggesting improvements. They're offering constructive feedback. However, the suggestion is quite broad and doesn't provide detailed actionable steps. It's helpful but could be more detailed. So, I'd rate this as somewhat helpful because it's meaningful but lacks depth in suggestions.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores would be: Actionability 4, Grounding Specificity 5, Verifiability 3, and Helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review suggests an action to discuss different input types but doesn't provide explicit steps, making it somewhat actionable.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The reviewer specifically mentions examples like biomedical signals and speech, and points out a citation issue, making it fully grounded.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The reviewer makes a judgment about the citation being disordered but lacks supporting evidence, making it somewhat verifiable.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The review offers constructive feedback about the citation but lacks detailed suggestions, making it somewhat helpful.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It also mentions that the improvement in Table 5 isn't significant on some datasets, like OfficeHome where CSAC and the proposed solution have similar scores. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if this comment is explicit and concrete. The first part about Eq.4 implying u^l=1 is explicit, but the second part about the marginal improvement is more of an inference. The authors would need to figure out why the improvement is marginal. So, it's partly actionable but not entirely. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment talks about Eq.4 and Eq.3, which are equations, so that's explicit grounding. It also mentions specific datasets and scores, which is good. The specificity is high because it's pointing to exact numbers and examples. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that Eq.4 implies u^l=1. The reasoning is logical, explaining the implication. It's supported by the equations, so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment points out a specific finding about marginal improvement, which is helpful. It gives a clear example on OfficeHome datasets. However, it's somewhat generic, so maybe it's somewhat helpful.

It suggests that this approach might not be effective for other question types. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, it's stating what the issue is. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It mentions that this could cause poor generalization, which gives a clear direction on what the problem is. So, it's both explicit and concrete. Therefore, it should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about transforming questions into masked statements. It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. It's a general statement about the method, not pointing to a specific section or issue. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. It's just a general critique without pinpointing an area.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review states that transforming questions into masked statements might cause poor generalization.

It suggests conducting calibration curves and comparing with traditional methods. Now, looking at the explicitness, the review is clear about the issues and the solutions, so that's explicit. For concreteness, it tells the authors exactly what to do, like creating calibration curves and discussing differences. So it's pretty actionable. I think this is highly actionable because it gives clear steps without being vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about model consistency, clinical scoring, and suggests calibration curves. It mentions specific parts like the agreement between predicted scores and actual risk, which is specific.

The comment identifies an issue with the equations but doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to fix it. It's clear that \u03c4 is missing, but the suggestion is vague.

The review points out that the methodology requires significant additional assumptions, specifically mentioning that the test set should come from the same distribution as the query set. It also points out an inequality with the wrong sign. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does mention specific issues: the test set distribution assumption and the incorrect inequality. These are clear actions the authors should take. However, the advice is a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to address these issues. For example, it doesn't suggest alternative distributions or corrections for the inequality. So, while the actions are explicit, the details are not concrete. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because the actions are clear, but the implementation isn't detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer refers to the test set distribution and an inequality, which are specific parts of the paper. They also mention standard machine learning assumptions, which are well-known, so the grounding is strong. The specificity comes from clearly pointing out issues in specific sections and providing examples (like the inequality). So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer's claims are that the test set distribution assumption is standard and that the inequality is incorrect. These are supported by common knowledge in machine learning and the specific mention of the inequality's wrong sign. The reasoning is clear and references well-known practices, so this is **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review provides clear feedback on two key issues: the distribution assumption and the inequality. It's specific enough for the authors to act on, though it could be expanded. The feedback is actionable and addresses genuine concerns, so it's **Mostly Helpful**.

But does it give enough detail? The comment mentions backing up their argument with experiments but doesn't specify how. So, it's explicit about the action but lacks details on how to implement it. That makes it **Borderline Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but doesn't provide the specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about backing up their argument experimentally but doesn't mention specific sections or data. It's a bit vague about where the experiments should be conducted.

Well, it's pointing out a problem, but it doesn't tell the author what to do. So it's not explicit because the author isn't told to fix it or how. It's more of an implicit comment, so it's not actionable. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it suggests a problem but doesn't give a clear fix.

Then, it talks about the state space representation, which is a specific part of the paper. So the grounding is full because it accurately points to the section and explains what's wrong. The specificity is also high because it clearly states what needs fixing. So this should be a 5.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim because it's suggesting that the illustration is unclear.

Is this explicit? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a limitation, but it's more of an opinion rather than a direct action. So, it's not explicit because it's a judgment about the approach's scalability. It's not vague either; it's clear that the method isn't suitable for large problems. But since it's a judgment, maybe it's not actionable because the authors don't get a clear instruction on what to do next. So, I think this is **1: Unactionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**.

So, it's explicit but lacks detail. That makes it borderline actionable because the action is clear, but the implementation isn't specified.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to characteristic function regularization by name, so it's fully grounded. It also mentions the lack of motivation, which is specific to that method, so that's specific as well.

The comment suggests an improvement by being more specific. \n\nFor actionability, it's about whether the reviewer gives a clear action. Here, the reviewer is pointing out that the statement is too weak and providing a specific correction. That seems explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer isn't just saying it's weak; they're also stating that it's widely accepted as implausible. So the action is clear and the details are provided. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment refers to the introduction and mentions that backprop is widely accepted as biologically implausible. It's specific about the part of the paper (introduction) and clearly states the issue. So this is fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5 here.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The comment claims that the statement is too weak and suggests a specific correction. The justification is that backprop is widely accepted as biologically implausible. This is supported by common knowledge, so it's well-justified. Therefore, this should be a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment is pointing out a weakness and providing a clear suggestion. It's helpful because it guides the author to improve their statement. It's specific and actionable, so it's highly helpful. That's a 5.\n\nI think all these aspects are positively evaluated because the review is clear, specific, well-supported, and directly helpful to the author.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review explicitly states that the statement in the introduction is too weak and provides a specific correction by mentioning that backpropagation is widely accepted as biologically implausible.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review point is asking about the extent to which the results depend on capturing periodicity instead of compositionality more generally. It suggests comparing a model that can't capture periodicity with others where periodicity was involved. The reviewer is curious if adding periodicity to the spectral kernel would help it match the explicitly compositional model's results.\n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is posing a question, but it's more of an exploratory thought rather than a direct instruction on what to do. They're asking if a specific change (adding periodicity to the kernel) would help, but they're not giving clear steps on how to implement this or what changes to make. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an open-ended question, which makes it less actionable. Therefore, I'd rate this as **1: Unactionable** because it doesn't provide a clear action for the authors to take.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer is asking about the extent of periodicity's role in the results. They mention specific experiments (excluding 1b) and the types of relationships learned. They're pointing out that the comparison model can't capture periodicity, which is a specific part of the paper. They're also asking about adding periodicity to the spectral kernel, which is a specific change. So, they're clearly identifying the part of the paper being discussed and what's missing. This shows strong grounding because they're pinpointing the section and the issue within it. The specificity is also high because they're not just saying \"periodicity\" but specifying how it applies to the models and experiments. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is asking whether adding periodicity to the spectral kernel would help. This is a claim because they're making a suggestion. Now, is this claim well-supported? They're asking a question, but they're not providing evidence or reasoning. They're just posing a hypothetical. Without any supporting arguments or references, this claim isn't well-verified. So, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification or evidence backing up the suggestion.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is asking a question about a specific aspect of their model and results. While this is a valid point, it's more of a curiosity than a suggestion for improvement. It doesn't provide concrete advice or actionable steps for the authors. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth and clarity. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does touch on an important consideration but doesn't offer much guidance beyond that.\n\nPutting it all together, the review point is somewhat helpful but lacks in actionability, grounding specificity, and verifiability.

Also what about the ablation studies of MCT without the adaptive metrics.\" \n\nFirst, I check if it's an explicit action. The reviewer is asking a question, which is a common way to prompt the author to explain something. But is it explicit? Well, it's a question, so the author would need to provide an explanation. It's not giving a direct instruction like \"Rewrite section X\" or \"Add figure Y.\" So, it's more of an implicit action. \n\nNext, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking about the discrepancy between two tables and about ablation studies. The author would need to know exactly where the issue is and what changes to make. Without more details, the author might not know how to fix it. So, it's not very concrete. \n\nTherefore, this review is **Borderline Actionable** because it's asking a question that requires the author to provide an explanation, but it's not giving clear instructions on how to proceed.\n\nMoving on to **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions Table 6 and Table 1, specifically referring to MCT-pair, and also ablation studies without adaptive metrics. \n\nThe reviewer is accurately pointing out specific sections of the paper (tables) and specific aspects (MCT-pair and ablation studies). This means the author can pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. So, the grounding is strong because it's clearly referring to specific parts of the paper. \n\nSpecificity is also good because the reviewer is not just saying \"something is wrong\" but is asking about particular studies and metrics. This gives the author clear directions on where to focus their improvements. \n\nThus, this review is **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately references specific parts of the paper and clearly specifies the areas needing attention.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by pointing out discrepancies and suggesting the need for ablation studies. The reviewer is asking the author to explain why there's a discrepancy and whether ablation studies are necessary. \n\nHowever, the reviewer isn't providing any evidence or justification for these claims. They're just stating observations, which are subjective. Without supporting arguments or references, the claim isn't well-verified. \n\nSo, this review is **Unverifiable** because it contains claims without any supporting evidence or justification.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

The review points out that some abbreviations aren't defined, like \"NE\" on line 73, and mentions superscript notation in equation 6 that's undefined later. It also cites three papers. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the suggestions are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does mention specific issues, like undefined abbreviations and unclear notation, which is explicit. However, they don't tell the authors exactly how to fix these. For example, they say \"NE is not defined\" but don't specify which section or page. Similarly, the superscript notation isn't explained. So, while the action is clear that something needs fixing, the details are vague. That makes it borderline actionable because the action is there but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer talks about undefined abbreviations and notation but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper these issues are in. They mention specific papers, but that's more about the sources than the specific section of the draft. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint the exact part of the paper being addressed. They mention the issue but don't direct the authors to a specific section or figure. Therefore, this is weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The reviewer suggests that \"NE\" isn't defined and points out that the superscript notation is undefined later. They also cite three papers. The claims here are that the abbreviations are undefined and the notation is unclear. The verifiability comes from citing other papers, but these citations are only provided much later. The reasoning is a bit vague because the reviewer doesn't explain why these citations are relevant or how they directly affect the current paper. So, the verifiability is somewhat there but lacks depth. It's somewhat verifiable because there's some justification, but it's not fully robust or clear.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review provides specific issues and cites relevant papers, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are quite general. The reviewer doesn't specify how to fix the undefined abbreviations or the notation. They just point out that these are problems. While this is helpful, it's not as detailed as it could be. It gives a starting point but doesn't guide the authors all the way to a solution.

The reviewer mentions the baselines aren't suitable, but they don't specify which part of the paper is affected. They don't point to a particular section or figure, so the grounding is weak.

It mentions that other 3D CNNs like X3D and SlowFast have been proposed to reduce computation. The reviewer is asking if the proposed method works on these and what the advantage is. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is suggesting a comparison but not directly telling the authors what to do. They're implying that using more efficient 3D CNNs could be better, but they're not giving a clear action.

Then, they ask about the advantage, which is specific to those models. So, the grounding is strong because they're pointing to exact parts of the paper and asking about a specific aspect.

It also suggests a related work for discussion. Now, for actionability, it's about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The first part talks about the bitrate range for BD-rate comparison, which is specific, so that's explicit. However, suggesting a related work is more of an implication rather than a direct action. So, it's partially actionable.

The review mentions training a discriminator but doesn't specify how or where to do it. It's a bit vague because it doesn't tell the authors exactly where Figure 1 is or how to implement the co-adaptation.

So, the grounding is strong because it clearly mentions the figures and the methodological difference. It's fully grounded and specific, so maybe a 5.\n\nVerifiability. The comment makes a claim by suggesting a method to confirm the claim. It provides a rationale by comparing to similar figures and explaining the co-adaptation issue.

The review gives a clear method to confirm their claim by suggesting a specific experiment and highlighting a potential issue.

The review mentions \"Poor writing\" and \"annotations are hard to follow.\" It's pointing out issues but doesn't specify what needs to be done.

The review refers to \"Poor writing\" and \"annotations.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is wrong. It's too vague. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint where the issue is. It's not fully grounded since it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Hence, a 2 for grounding specificity.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a judgment about the writing being poor and annotations being hard to follow.

Maybe they should have suggested a specific change or provided a hint.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions NodeSort and base nodes but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model they're referring to. They're asking about the implications, which is a bit general. So, the grounding is weak because they don't clearly point to a specific section or figure. They could have mentioned, for example, a particular section in the methodology or a figure in the results.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is posing a question without any supporting evidence or justification.

Yes, it's telling the authors what needs to be done. But is it concrete? The review doesn't specify how to write the conclusion or summary, like mentioning particular sections or points. So it's an explicit action but vague on the details. That would make it **Borderline Actionable** because it's clear that a conclusion and summary are needed, but it doesn't provide the specifics on how to implement that.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions a conclusion and summary but doesn't specify which part of the paper they should address. It's too vague. The authors might not know where to start or what exactly to include.

It's saying that adding a sentence is needed. But is there any justification for this? The review doesn't explain why adding a sentence is necessary or how it improves the paper. It just recommends it. So, there's no supporting evidence or reasoning, making it unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is clear about suggesting an addition, which is helpful. It gives a specific instruction without being vague. However, it doesn't elaborate on why the addition is necessary or how it will help, which might make it somewhat helpful but not fully. So, it's somewhat helpful because it provides a clear action, but it lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is explicit in its action but not concrete, fully grounded and specific, has no verifiable justification, and is somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review explicitly states the action of adding a sentence but does not provide concrete details on how to implement it, making it borderline actionable.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The review explicitly mentions Section 3.2 and clearly specifies the needed addition, resulting in full grounding and specificity.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The review contains a claim (suggestion to add a sentence) without any supporting evidence or reasoning, making it unverifiable.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The review provides a clear action (adding a sentence) but lacks justification, making it somewhat helpful.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Line 44: What is meant by the initial rationale selector is perfect? It seems if it were perfect no additional work needs to be done.\" The reviewer is pointing out that the term \"initial rationale selector\" is vague. They're suggesting that if it were clear, there would be no need for additional work. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is asking a question about what \"initial rationale selector\" means, which is a bit vague. They're implying that if it were clear, the issue would be resolved, but they don't specify what changes should be made. So, it's not giving a direct action; it's more of a clarifying question. That makes it somewhat actionable because the author can infer that they need to clarify the term, but the action isn't detailed. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment is about a specific term, \"initial rationale selector.\" The reviewer is asking what it means, which implies they can identify the part being addressed. They mention \"initial rationale selector\" which is a specific term in the paper, so they've grounded it. They also specify what they're asking about, which adds to the specificity. So, this should be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting that if \"initial rationale selector\" were clear, no additional work is needed. The reviewer is making a judgment that clarity would eliminate the need for more work. This judgment is supported by logical reasoning, so it's thoroughly justified. Therefore, this is 5: Fully Verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue and suggesting a solution. They're clear about the problem and provide a constructive suggestion. This is helpful because it guides the author to clarify their term, which is a direct improvement.

It also asks about the number of questions and the system's accuracy. I think this is an implicit action because the reviewer is asking a question, but it's not directly telling the authors what to do. So, it's not explicit. As for concreteness, the reviewer isn't giving specific steps or modifications, just asking questions. So, it's not very actionable. I'd rate this as 2 because it's implicit and vague.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions domain ontologies and placeholders but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to.

It doesn't clearly identify the specific aspect, so I'd give it a 2 here.\n\nVerifiability. The review is asking for specific data points like the number of questions and accuracy.

It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a missing comparison but isn't telling the authors exactly what to do. So, it's implicit. Since it's not explicit, it's not actionable. So, I'd give it a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions specific baselines like expected utility. That's a clear reference to a specific part of the paper, so grounding is strong. They also specify what's missing, which is the comparison. So, grounding_specificity should be 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim that the paper lacks comparison to baselines.

However, the suggestions are quite vague, like \"how about other bit operations?\" and \"If you can analyze the energy consumption as reference[15] did, this paper would be more solid.\" These are clear actions but lack specific details on how to implement them. So, it's not fully actionable because the steps aren't detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the actions are explicit but not concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer refers to Figure 5a and suggests improvements but doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper is being addressed. They also mention energy consumption without pointing to a specific reference.

They provide a reference, which is helpful, but the explanation is vague. They don't give a logical reason or more examples to support their claim. This makes it somewhat verifiable because there's some justification but not enough to be fully verifiable. So, I'd score this as \"Somewhat Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review offers some suggestions but they're quite broad and don't provide detailed guidance.

It suggests including certain experimental suggestions based on the article's characteristics. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The review does state an action: reorganizing and improving the experimental section. But it's quite vague on how to do this. It doesn't specify what parts need to be moved or how the content should be restructured. So, it's not explicit enough.

The review mentions the experimental section needs reorganization but doesn't specify which part. It talks about highlighting the method's superiority but doesn't name the exact section or how to do that. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the exact area. It's more general, which means the authors can't confidently identify where the issue is. Hence, it's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nVerifiability. The review contains a claim that the experimental part needs reorganization. It suggests including certain experimental suggestions. Now, for verifiability, we need to see if the claim is supported. The suggestion to include specific experimental content is somewhat justified because it's based on the article's characteristics. However, it doesn't provide concrete references or examples.

That's a 1: Not Grounded.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim that the model is overly simple. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a statement without support. So it's Unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment points out a problem but doesn't suggest improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much.

The review says that because the mixup technique is used in LUMP and the experiments on SplitCIFAR-100 and SplitTiny-ImageNet, they should include results from excluding mixup to show the pure contribution. It seems like it's suggesting an action, which is to run experiments without mixup. But the review doesn't specify how to do that or what the expected outcome should be. It's a bit vague on the implementation details. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to change or how to interpret the results. Maybe they need more guidance on how to exclude the technique and what metrics to look at.

It could be better if it pointed out a specific part of the paper or gave a clear reference. But since it's just a general statement, it's not fully grounded. Maybe it's weakly grounded because it mentions the reference, but it's not precise.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a judgment that the paper is incremental compared to [31]. It's a claim because it's an opinion. Now, is this claim supported? The review doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to back up why it's incremental. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting data or logic. It's more of a subjective opinion without backing.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review is pointing out a limitation but isn't providing specific suggestions on how to improve. It's vague about what needs to be done. So, while it's helpful in pointing out a problem, it's not very detailed or actionable. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. It could be more helpful if it suggested specific changes or provided reasoning.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the definitions provided. The review is clear in its point but lacks specifics and actionable steps, so it's helpful but not highly so. It's grounding is weak because it's not pointing to exact parts, and it's not very verifiable because it lacks support. Actionability is borderline because it's vague but could be expanded.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The comment suggests the paper is incremental but doesn't specify actions or how to improve.

It's making a clear statement that replacing steps with a random mechanism caused a drop in performance.

The reviewer is pointing out that the definition is missing. Now, for actionability, it's about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The reviewer is explicitly pointing out a problem, which is good. But the suggestion is to define T_a(t), which is a clear action. However, the reviewer doesn't specify how to define it\u2014like whether it's a typo, a new term, or needs to be expanded. So it's explicit but vague on the exact action. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear that something needs to be done but lacks detail on how.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer mentions Section 3.1 and points out the definition issue. They're not just saying \"Section 3.1\" but also imply that the definition is missing, which helps ground the comment to a specific part of the paper. The specificity is about what needs fixing, which is the definition. So this seems well-grounded because it's pointing to a specific section and clearly states the issue. It's not just a general comment but targets a particular area, so grounding_specificity would be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting that T_a(t) should be defined. The justification is that it's a standard practice to define terms when they're used. This is logical reasoning and common knowledge, so it's fully verifiable. There's a clear reason why the claim is valid, so verifiability is 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a clear issue and suggesting a fix.

The first part asks for clarification, which is a bit vague, but the second part explains why adjustments are effective, which is more detailed. So, it's mostly actionable but maybe a bit vague on the first part. I'd rate this as 4.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions Figure 3, which is specific, and talks about amplitudes and the Frequency Stability score. They also point out spacing in equations.

Yes, it's telling the authors to explain something. Is it concrete? It says \"more explanations,\" which is a bit vague. It doesn't specify what exactly needs to be explained. So, I think this is borderline actionable because it's an implicit action but lacks detail on how to apply it.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity.

Then, it specifies what's wrong: the consistency between training and inference. That's specific. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim because it suggests an improvement. It needs to be supported. The reasoning is that more explanation would help, which is logical. There's no external reference, but the suggestion is clear. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's supported by logical reasoning but lacks an external reference.\n\nHelpfulness.

The second is about an extra period, also clear. Both are explicit actions. Now, for each, the review provides exact instructions: replace 'f' with 'g' and remove a period. These are concrete actions the authors can follow without ambiguity. So, this is highly actionable because the actions are explicit and the instructions are precise. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific lines (108 and 115) and points out issues there. It doesn't just say \"line 108 is wrong\" but specifies the typo and the extra period. It also refers to the networks in the MCL model, which is a specific part of the paper. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the sections being discussed, and it's specific about what's wrong. This should also be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides clear reasoning. It explains why the typo and extra period are issues, like how typos can affect readability and how extra periods might disrupt the flow. It doesn't just state the problem but also gives logical justifications. This makes the claims well-supported, so it's fully verifiable.

The review does suggest that the author should check the accuracy of entities and relationships, which is an action.

Therefore, it's probably **Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't provide details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about replacing entities and relationships but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be checked.

Second, it wants normalization tricks in another section. Third, it says the current description is scattered. Each of these is explicit actions the authors should take.

It then suggests adding a table comparing CoT prompting methods and asks two specific questions about assumptions and selection criteria. The questions are about why certain assumptions are made and whether the criteria are reasonable. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the suggestions are explicit and concrete. The reviewer is asking the authors to create a table, which is a clear action. However, the questions about assumptions and criteria are more open-ended and vague. The authors might not know exactly how to implement these suggestions. So, while the action is explicit, the guidance on how to create the table or address the questions isn't detailed. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully because the implementation steps aren't clear.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer refers to section 4.2 for selection criteria but doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. They mention questions with more than 60 tokens and rationales with more than 5 steps but don't point to a specific section or unique aspect.

The reviewer is making claims by suggesting adding a table and questioning the criteria. These are subjective opinions. For verifiability, we need to see if these claims are supported. The suggestion to add a table is somewhat verifiable because it's a common practice in academic writing to improve clarity. However, the specific questions about assumptions and criteria are more speculative and lack concrete references or logical reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully because the reasoning behind the questions isn't detailed.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review provides specific suggestions but doesn't elaborate on why they are beneficial or how they improve the paper. The questions are open-ended, which might not give the authors a clear direction on how to proceed.

Therefore, the helpfulness is somewhat there but could be improved with more detailed guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its pros and cons.

The reviewer suggests eliminating a section, which is a clear action. So it's explicit. Now, is the action concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how to eliminate the section or why it's unnecessary. They just suggest removing it. So, it's explicit but vague on the details. That would make it **Borderline Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions section 3.2 and refers to the Gumbel-Softmax/Concrete distribution. They don't explicitly name the section or provide a detailed reason for its removal. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly why the section is being removed. They imply it's because readers know about the distribution, but they don't specify that. So, this would be **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting the section can be removed. They back it up by stating that readers are presumed to know about the distribution. However, they don't provide evidence or reasoning why the distribution is relevant or why the section is unnecessary. This is **Unverifiable** because there's no justification or references to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is clear about suggesting a section can be removed, which is helpful. However, it lacks specifics on why the section should be removed or how to do it. It's vague, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful.

The first part mentions adding tasks like word similarity and sentence translation, which are explicit actions. The second part talks about adding morphologically rich languages, which is also an explicit action. Both are clear and direct, so they are actionable. Since the actions are explicit and concrete, the score should be 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review points specifically mention adding certain tasks and languages. The mention of MUSE paper and others provides a clear reference, so the grounding is strong. Additionally, the suggestions are specific about the tasks and languages, making it well-grounded. Therefore, the grounding specificity is 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides references to the MUSE paper and mentions other works, which supports the suggestions. It also suggests looking into low-resource languages, which is a logical extension. The evidence is sufficient, so verifiability is 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review offers clear and specific suggestions that would help the authors improve their experiments.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review says the regularization term is ad-hoc and lacks theoretical support. It mentions that some statistics could replace mean and standard deviation but doesn't explain why they aren't used. For actionability, I need to see if the comment gives clear instructions or suggests specific changes. The review points out the issue but doesn't tell the authors what to do next. It's vague on how to improve, so it's not actionable. Maybe the authors could look into alternative regularization methods, but the review doesn't specify which ones or how. So, this is borderline actionable because it does point out a problem but doesn't give concrete steps.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment talks about regularization and statistics but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It mentions mean and standard deviation but doesn't tie it directly to a section or figure in the paper. The grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. It's more of a general critique without pinpointing the exact issue, so it's not fully grounded.\n\nVerifiability. The review makes a claim that the regularization is ad-hoc and lacks theoretical support. It suggests using other statistics but doesn't provide evidence or references to back this up. The justification is vague, so it's not fully verifiable. It's more of a statement than a well-supported claim, so it's borderline.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review is pointing out a problem and suggesting improvements but doesn't provide detailed explanations or examples. It's clear that the authors need to consider alternative regularization methods, but the review doesn't elaborate on why other methods might be better or how to implement them. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth, so it's a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would reflect the points I considered for each aspect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review points out the ad-hoc nature of the regularization term but doesn't specify explicit actions or changes to implement.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review points are about needing to report averages over multiple runs, discussing decision boundaries, and explaining what's in Figure 9. For each of these, the comments are giving suggestions but not specifying exactly how to implement them. For example, saying \"report average over multiple runs\" is an action, but it doesn't tell the authors how to calculate or present it. Similarly, discussing decision boundaries is a suggestion, but it's vague on what analysis to do. The same goes for explaining Figure 9. So, these are explicit actions but lack concrete details. That makes them borderline actionable because they do ask the authors to do something, but they don't provide the specifics on how.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions specific sections: Section 3.1 and Figure 9. It's clear which parts of the paper it's referring to, so that's full grounding. However, the suggestions are quite vague. For instance, discussing why decision boundaries look a certain way isn't specific enough. The authors might not know exactly what aspects to focus on. Similarly, explaining what's in Figure 9 is broad and doesn't give a clear direction. So, while it's grounded, the specificity is under because the suggestions aren't detailed enough.\n\nVerifiability. The review points are opinions or suggestions. For example, recommending to report averages is a claim, and it's supported by the need for statistical reliability, which is common knowledge. Similarly, suggesting a discussion on decision boundaries is a claim, and it's supported by the importance of understanding model behavior, which is widely accepted. The same goes for explaining Figure 9; it's a suggestion backed by the value of detailed analysis. So, these are all verifiable because they're supported by logical reasoning and common knowledge.\n\nHelpfulness. The review points are clear and suggest specific improvements. They're pointing out areas where the authors can enhance their paper, like statistical reliability and model interpretability. These are actionable and provide meaningful feedback. Even though the suggestions are a bit vague, they're still helpful because they guide the authors on what needs to be done. So, I'd rate this as highly helpful because it's clear and prompts the authors to improve their work, even if the specifics aren't entirely detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the definitions provided. The review is clear in its suggestions but lacks some detail, making it somewhat helpful but not entirely.

The reviewer is asking for clarification or an explanation. Is this explicit? Yes, the reviewer is asking for why it's useful and what the authors meant. So, it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is prompting for more details, but it's not giving specific instructions on what to do. It's more of a question, so it's somewhat vague. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper (lines 80-82) and then referring back to it in the figure. The mention of lines 80-82 is explicit, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is about explaining why that metric was used elsewhere. The reviewer is asking for an explanation, which is specific to that part. So, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it clearly references the section and asks for a specific explanation.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the metric wasn't insightful but used anyway. This is a claim. The justification is that it's unclear why it was used, which is a bit vague. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's a claim but not much support.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking for clarification, which is helpful but not very detailed.

So it's explicit and concrete. That should be a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review is pointing out a specific part of the plot, the diagonal line. It's clear which part is being addressed, so the grounding is full. It also explains why the change is needed, which adds specificity. So this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about terminology clarity and suggesting a change. It's not providing any external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion. So it's a normal statement without a claim, which would be an X.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

I guess you want to write that the sum of the 'optimistic' hoped for rewards is close to the expected actual rewards.\" Hmm, this is pointing out that the claims at lines 240 and 428 are using \"is sufficient\" but isn't clear about what they're sufficient for. The reviewer is suggesting that the author should explain that the optimistic rewards are close to actual ones. \n\nIs this explicit? The reviewer is asking the author to clarify what \"sufficient\" refers to, so it's an explicit action. But is it vague? The reviewer isn't giving specific instructions on how to improve the draft. They just ask the author to explain the connection between optimistic and actual rewards. So, it's explicit but vague. \n\nLooking at the scale, 3 is somewhat actionable because it's explicit but lacks detail on implementation. So, I'll give it a 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is pointing out an issue at specific lines, L240 and L428. They're asking for clarification, so they're identifying the specific part of the paper. That's full grounding because they mention the lines. Then, they're asking the author to explain the relationship between optimistic and actual rewards, which is specific to those lines. So, both grounding and specificity are fully met. It's 5 on grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that the author should explain the relationship. Is this claim verifiable? The reviewer isn't providing evidence or reasoning; they're just pointing out a gap. So, it's not verifiable. It's more of a suggestion without justification. Therefore, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking for clarification on specific lines and suggesting an explanation. This provides some guidance but is vague. It helps the author understand where the issue is but doesn't offer detailed steps or examples. So, it's somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nI think that's all.

It mentions that the model isn't shown to be a prototype approximation of existing RNN models. The reviewer is pointing out a lack of comparison, which is an explicit action. However, the suggestion is vague because it doesn't provide specific steps or examples on how to improve the model. So, it's explicit but not concrete. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer does mention specific sections, like Section 2.3, which is explicit. They also compare to task-optimized approaches, which is a clear reference. But the comparison is general, not diving into details or unique aspects of the model. So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because they pinpoint the section but don't go into specifics about why it's lacking.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the model isn't a prototype approximation.

It mentions that O_up should output offsets for every keypoint relative to the center of the upper part. However, it's unclear how the network parts are supposed to predict all these keypoints. The explanation is a bit vague because it doesn't provide explicit instructions on how the network should handle each keypoint. So, the action isn't very clear, and the details on how to implement this are missing. This makes the action somewhat vague, so it's not highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review point refers to O_up and the distance r, but it doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a bit vague about the exact section or figure where the issue lies. Additionally, it doesn't provide specific details about what needs to be fixed, like whether it's about accuracy or computational efficiency. So, the grounding isn't very specific, and the specificity isn't clear either.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review point doesn't make any claims. It's more of a suggestion without providing evidence or reasoning to support why the network parts should predict all keypoints.

For example, suggesting to improve figure clarity, advising to explain equation 5's derivation, mentioning theta^{t+1/2}, and pointing out the lack of proper definition for S* and S~. These are all direct actions the authors can take. However, each of these suggestions is a bit vague. The review doesn't specify exactly how to improve the figures or where to add an explanation for the equations. So, while the actions are explicit, they lack concrete details. That makes it a **Borderline Actionable** score because the actions are clear but not fully detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to specific parts of the paper: figures, equations, and parameters. It mentions equation 5, equation 4, theta^{t+1/2}, S*, and S~. It also points out that S~ is defined in Assumption 1 but the definition is cyclic, which is a specific issue. The review accurately identifies these parts, so it's **Fully Grounded**. Additionally, it clearly specifies the problems with each mentioned element, so it's **Specific**. Therefore, it's a **Fully Grounded and Specific** score.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains claims about the issues in the paper.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review says the author is using VAD but discarding bins with magnitude less than epsilon. It suggests this is a mistake because it's more like thresholding TF bins rather than a VAD. The comment is pointing out a specific action the author should take: they should consider whether this is a VAD issue or just thresholding. It's explicit about the action but doesn't give detailed steps on how to check or fix it. So, it's explicit but vague on the implementation. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions VAD and specifically points out the thresholding issue. It clearly states which part of the paper is being addressed, like the method section where TF bins are discussed. It also explains why it's a problem, linking it to VAD's purpose. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately references the paper and explains the issue. The specificity is high because it details the problem and its implications. Therefore, it's **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the author's approach is incorrect because they're treating it as thresholding instead of VAD. It provides some reasoning but doesn't cite external references or examples. It's somewhat supported but lacks depth. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out a clear issue and suggests the author check their method. It's helpful because it identifies a problem and provides a direction for the author to improve.

It suggests that the model needs to better handle ambiguous language to improve goal recovery. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The comment is pointing out a problem but doesn't tell the author exactly what to do. It says the model didn't recover the predicate, but it doesn't specify how to fix it. So, it's implicit. Is it concrete? Well, it's a bit vague because it doesn't tell the author how to adjust their model or data. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe it's borderline actionable because it does hint at a problem but lacks specific steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about failures on ALFRED due to goal misspecification. It mentions the LLM not recovering the formal goal predicate, especially with ambiguous language. It doesn't explicitly state which part of the paper or model this refers to, like a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part.

The support is that the LLM didn't recover the formal goal predicate. Is this justified? It's somewhat justified because it's a logical explanation, but it doesn't cite any external references or provide examples.

It also questions whether SOTA schemes are too similar, which implies difficulty in improvement. The explicitness here is clear; the reviewer is giving a specific action: analyze disparities and compare. But the concreteness is a bit lacking because it doesn't specify how to analyze or what comparisons to make. It's more of a suggestion without detailed steps.

The reviewer mentions IGEV and SOTA methods, which are specific enough. They also suggest comparing disparities and analyzing the distribution, which are clear references within the paper.

The review does state what needs to be done, like evaluating DCI with E and S, so that's explicit. But it doesn't tell exactly how to do it, like whether to fix probing capacity or latent size.

The review talks about quantization being a bottleneck for big data and models. It mentions scalability in terms of N and M, which are specific parts of the paper. It also refers to the method losing its point, which is a clear indication of the issue. So the grounding is solid because it accurately points to the specific areas without needing more details.

The reviewer does suggest a specific action: comparing gradients. That's explicit. But does it give a clear step-by-step on how to do that? The comment is a bit vague about how to compute or interpret the gradients. It just says \"provide the gradient comparison,\" which is a bit broad. So, it's explicit but not very detailed.

The comment talks about loss functions and their gradient distributions but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's general, not pointing to a specific section or figure.

There's no need for external references here. So, this is **Somewhat Verifiable** (3) because it has some justification but could be more detailed.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

It mentions that the feedback network's performance improved when both the incorrect and corrected phrases, along with the type of mistake, were included. It also compares performance with just natural language feedback. \n\nI think this is explicit because it's directly stating what was done and what the results were. It's not just a suggestion but a clear action taken by including specific details. So, it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly what was done and how it affected performance. So, it's concrete and explicit, making it highly actionable. \n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions the type of mistake and the phrases. It's specific about what information was included and how it was used. It's not just a general statement but points out exact elements of the feedback network. So, this is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the parts being discussed. It's also specific because it details the type of mistake and the phrases, which helps the authors understand exactly what was evaluated.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review claims that including specific information improves performance and that natural language feedback alone is less effective. This is a claim because it's making a judgment about the effectiveness of different feedback types. Now, is this claim verifiable? Yes, because it references specific experiments or performance metrics. The authors can check the performance numbers to verify the claim. So, it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides a clear comparison of different feedback types and their impact on performance. It's actionable and gives the authors specific insights into what part of their feedback network was most effective.

The reviewer is pointing out that the comparison is somewhat vague. \n\nI think the action here is pointing out a lack of clarity. The reviewer is asking for explicit comparisons and explanations, which would make the feedback more actionable for the authors.

The reviewer is asking why [9] was compared first and then [16], and why computational cost was only discussed with [9]. They're also questioning if computational cost is a significant practical issue. \n\nThis part is making claims about the comparison order and the relevance of computational cost. The justification is vague, just asking why and questioning the focus. There's no concrete reasoning or references provided to support these claims. So, the verifiability is low.

It's talking about specific datasets and the impact on SSL. I think it's grounding because it's referring to specific datasets, but it's a bit vague about what exactly needs to be done. So, maybe a 3 because it identifies the area but doesn't specify how to address it.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that AutoAugment's policy might leak because of pretraining on ImageNet. It's suggesting this as a possible trap but doesn't provide evidence or references. So, it's not very verifiable. Maybe a 2 because it's a claim but lacks supporting details.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review raises concerns about SSL algorithms and whether combining datasets helps. It's making the authors think about their assumptions but doesn't provide concrete solutions or data. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most.

It also mentions that DeepRL methods are widely adopted and provides a historical context. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the suggestions are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does give specific areas to improve, like the title, but doesn't tell the authors exactly how to change it.

The review is referring to specific sections of the paper, like equation (10) and (3), and the OT sample selection process. It mentions specific parts of the methodology, which means the authors can identify exactly where the issue lies. The questions are about specific aspects, so the grounding is strong. It's not vague or too general.

The review is making claims about the OT process running iteratively or once, suggesting that more details and a flow chart would help. It's also asking about the runtime, which is a claim because it's making a judgment about the efficiency of the process. The verifiability here is good because it's pointing out areas where the authors can look for more information, which is helpful for them.

It mentions multi-node seed cascades being created by merging single-node ones. I think this is an explicit action because it directly points out an issue. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It suggests they should clarify the experimental setup, but it doesn't specify how. So, it's explicit but not concrete. I'd rate this as Somewhat Actionable because it's clear but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions multi-node seed cascades and how they were created. It's pretty specific about the part of the paper being discussed, so that's fully grounded. It also clearly states what's wrong, which is specific. So, this should be Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim that the experimental setup is semi-real. It's supported by the reasoning about multi-node cascades being merged. This is logical and clear, so it's fully verifiable. The reasoning is solid and provides enough justification, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that bias benchmarks only assess gender, race, and religion, and misses other important biases and datasets like state-of-the-art generative models like GPT. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. \n\nIn this case, the review is pointing out missing areas but doesn't specify how to address them. It doesn't tell the authors what changes to make or how to improve their models. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit comment. Therefore, it's not highly actionable because it lacks detailed guidance. I think this would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest a problem but doesn't tell how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about bias benchmarks missing gender, race, religion, and state-of-the-art models. It's clear which parts are being addressed\u2014specifically, the mentioned biases and datasets. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points out the areas lacking. The specificity is also good because it details exactly what's missing. This should be a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that the benchmarks miss certain biases and datasets. It doesn't provide any justification or references for why these are important or how they impact the models. Without supporting evidence, it's hard to verify the claims. So, this would be **2: Borderline Verifiable** because there's some information but lacks the necessary backing to fully support the claims.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out missing aspects but doesn't offer concrete suggestions on how to improve. It's clear that there are issues, but it doesn't guide the authors on what steps to take. This makes it somewhat helpful but not very detailed. So, it should be a **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it identifies problems but doesn't provide actionable advice.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own rationale and score based on how well the review provides clear, specific, and justifiable feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review points out missing areas but doesn't specify how to address them, making it somewhat actionable but not highly so.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3: Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The review accurately identifies the missing biases and datasets, providing clear grounding.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5: Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The review mentions missing aspects but lacks supporting evidence, making it borderline verifiable.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"2: Borderline Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The review identifies issues but doesn't offer concrete suggestions, making it somewhat helpful.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3: Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next, like which hyperparameters to adjust or how to perform the search. So, it's not giving a clear action, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it hints at needing to search but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The comment mentions hyperparameters and \u03b1 but doesn't specify which part of the paper or method they're referring to. It's vague about where the issue lies, so the grounding is weak.

The reviewer is prompting the authors to elaborate on this connection, which is an implicit action. They aren't giving a specific instruction on how to do this, so it's not fully actionable. Maybe the authors need to explain how the recent findings relate to their point. So, this is borderline actionable because it's clear the authors need to do something, but the method isn't specified.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions a specific reference about the 'nice' landscape of the objective function for symmetric order-4 tensors.

So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is suggesting the authors explore this connection. There's no claim here; it's more of a suggestion.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that MMD DRO doesn't have a tractable exact reformulation, which is a drawback. It also points out that the upper bound in Theorem 3.1 is crude because it drops a nonnegative constraint and more approximations are needed. Additionally, the assumption about the loss function being in the RKHS is restrictive. \n\nFor **Explicitness**, the reviewer is pointing out specific issues without asking the authors to take action beyond acknowledging the points. So it's explicit. \n\nFor **Concreteness**, the reviewer is giving clear information about the lack of reformulation, the crude upper bound, and the restrictive assumption. This is very concrete because the reviewer is not just stating a problem but also explaining why it's a problem and what the implications are. \n\nSo, this review is both explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable. Therefore, the actionability score is 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer refers to specific sections of the paper, like Theorem 3.1 and mentions the RKHS assumption. They also discusses the upper bound and the nonnegative constraint, which are specific parts of the paper. The reviewer is clear about what needs to be addressed, so the grounding is fully grounded and specific. Hence, the grounding_specificity score is 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the tractability of MMD DRO, the quality of the upper bound, and the restrictive assumption. Each of these claims is supported by logical reasoning and references to the paper's Theorem 3.1. The references are specific and well-supported, so the verifiability is fully justified. Therefore, the verifiability score is 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer provides clear feedback on the method's limitations, the quality of the upper bound, and the restrictive assumption. This is very helpful because it guides the authors on what aspects to improve. While it could be expanded, the provided information is actionable and constructive. So, the helpfulness score is 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review explicitly states the lack of a tractable reformulation, the crude upper bound, and the restrictive assumption about the loss function.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review point is asking about the relevance of a framework in specific contexts, like non-convex losses or non-norm type defenses. It's making the authors think about whether the framework is still useful or if it's irrelevant. The question is more about understanding the framework's limitations rather than providing a clear action or improvement. So, it's not giving an explicit action or a concrete solution. It's more of a thought-provoking question. Therefore, it's not very actionable because the authors might not know how to adjust their work based on this. So, I'd rate this as 2: Borderline Actionable because it does suggest something but doesn't tell them exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review point is talking about specific areas like non-convex losses and non-norm type defenses. It mentions these terms, so the authors can identify the sections related to these topics. It's not just a general comment; it's pointing out specific areas. Then, it's asking about the duality gap and maximization difficulties, which are specific issues within those areas. So, the grounding is strong because it clearly references specific parts of the paper. The specificity is also good because it's asking about particular problems. So, this should be 4: Mostly Grounded and Specific because it's clear and touches on specific issues.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review point is making claims about the framework's relevance, suggesting it might be irrelevant or not giving intuitions on risk bounds. It's presenting opinions without much justification. The claim is that the framework might be irrelevant due to issues like duality gaps. However, it doesn't provide evidence or references to back this up. It's more of a judgment without solid support. So, this is 3: Somewhat Verifiable because there's a claim, but it's not well-supported with examples or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review point is asking several questions but doesn't provide clear answers or actionable steps. It's more of a critique without giving specific suggestions on how to improve. The questions are open-ended and don't guide the authors on what changes to make. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that proving lower bounds is a major part of the work in batched ranking problems and that the paper uses a reduction from collaborative ranking, making the lower bounds follow as a corollary. It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a methodological approach but doesn't specify what exactly the authors should do next. So, it's not giving explicit actions or concrete steps. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. It might be somewhat helpful but lacks clear guidance.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about lower bounds and collaborative ranking but doesn't specify which part of the paper is being addressed. They mention the reduction but don't clearly identify the section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. The specificity about what needs fixing is also lacking.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the lower bounds follow from collaborative ranking results. They need to support this with logical reasoning or references. However, the explanation is vague, and it's not clear how exactly the reduction works or where the lower bounds come from. This makes the verifiability somewhat lacking because the justification isn't robust or detailed enough.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review does point out a significant methodological aspect, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide concrete suggestions or detailed reasoning.

It suggests using better prompts for better results. Explicitly, it's telling the authors to improve their prompts. That's an explicit action. But it doesn't specify how to do that, like what kind of prompts or examples. So it's not concrete. It's more of a suggestion without details. So I think this is borderline actionable because it's clear the authors need to change their prompts, but the method isn't detailed.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions prompting techniques but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what's wrong with the current prompts. It's a general statement about the technique being basic. So the grounding is weak because it doesn't point to a specific section or issue. It's just a general critique without pinpointing where the problem is.\n\nVerifiability. The review claims that better prompts can improve results, but it doesn't provide any evidence or references. It's just a suggestion without justification.

It just states that the current models are behind recent ones. So, the authors don't know if they need to improve their methods or what changes to make. That means it's not actionable because there's no clear direction for improvement. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review does mention specific models and their results, like GLaMM and UNINEXT, and provides exact metrics. It's clear which parts of the paper are being referred to, like the test sets. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the relevant sections. The specificity is also good because it details exactly what the models achieved. Therefore, grounding_specificity should be 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review includes specific references to external works with exact metrics. It's well-supported by external literature, which means the claims are backed up. The reasoning is clear, and the references are specific, so this is fully verifiable. So, verifiability gets a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review provides specific examples of other models' performance but doesn't suggest how to improve the current work.

Explicitly, it's pointing out that the choice of framework is OpenAI's Triton. That's an explicit action. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is suggesting that since the engineering improvements are known, a detailed explanation isn't needed. So, the action is to not provide a full-page explanation.

It suggests that because the method uses global pooling, it might be easier to improve a smaller backbone. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement these suggestions.

The review says that the method doesn't support well in practice because it requires sub-task-specific rewards, similar to dense rewards. It also asks if other methods like Qmix can handle sparse rewards. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, it's directly telling the authors what the issue is. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It mentions sub-task-specific rewards and compares it to dense rewards, giving a clear direction on what's needed. So I think it's actionable and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions sub-task-specific rewards and compares it to dense rewards. It's clear which part of the paper it's addressing because it's talking about the method's requirements. It also explains the comparison, so it's well grounded. I don't see any issues here, so a 5 seems right.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the method requires sub-task-specific rewards, similar to dense rewards. It's supported by the experiments mentioned, so it's well-justified. There's a logical reasoning backing it up, so this should be a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a limitation of the method and asking a relevant question. It's clear and provides meaningful feedback.

It mentions that the current experiments only cover spatial, temporal, or summary, but not all together. The comment suggests adding experiments for each. So, the action here is to add these experiments. But is it explicit? Yes, it tells the authors exactly what to do. Is it concrete? It specifies the exact experiments needed, so the authors know exactly what to do. So, this should be Highly Actionable (5).\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions experiments on different queries but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where to focus their experiments. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure. Therefore, this would be Weakly Grounded and Not Specific (2).\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is suggesting adding experiments but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement that more experiments are needed. There's no supporting evidence, so it's Unverifiable (1).\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review is pointing out a specific need for experiments but doesn't elaborate on why these experiments are important or how they would improve the work. It's somewhat vague, so the authors might not find it very helpful. It's Somewhat Helpful (3) because it does identify an improvement area but lacks depth.\n\nI think that's a thorough evaluation.

It's a good suggestion, but it's pretty vague. The reviewer doesn't specify what exactly to do or how to implement it. So, it's not giving clear actions for the authors to take.

It mentions that discriminative can't be used in real apps and asks about the generative setting. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, it's directly asking about the generative setting. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It tells the authors exactly where to look for the result (Table 1) and what to compare. So yes, it's concrete. Therefore, this should be Highly Actionable (5).\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to the discriminative and generative settings. It's specific about which parts of the paper it's talking about\u2014Table 1 and the two settings. So the grounding is explicit and clear. It's fully grounded because it accurately points to the relevant section and the specific issue. So Grounding Specificity is 5.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim by suggesting that the discriminative setting isn't suitable for real apps and asking about the generative setting. It's a claim because it's making a judgment about the applicability of the settings. Now, is this justified? The review doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning beyond stating the fact that discriminative isn't used in real apps. It's a bit vague because it doesn't explain why or provide evidence. So it's Mostly Verifiable (4).\n\nHelpfulness. The review is pointing out a limitation of the discriminative setting and asking about another, which is useful for the authors. It's clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful (5). It doesn't seem vague or unclear, so it's not just somewhat or barely helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores 5 except verifiability, which is 4. But wait, the review doesn't provide evidence for why discriminative isn't suitable, so maybe verifiability should be lower. Hmm, but it's a claim, so it's verifiable in the sense that it's a known limitation. Maybe it's still 4 because it lacks specific references or examples.

It mentions that the author's imagined process doesn't match what was done. It also suggests that it could work but is computationally demanding. \n\nIs this explicit? The reviewer is pointing out a weakness but doesn't tell the author exactly what to do. It's more of a critique without specific fixes. So, it's implicit.

So, it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete steps. I think that's a 3 for Actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to the Pareto front being non-convex and suggests a specific comparison. It mentions Concorde, which is a well-known heuristic, so that's pretty grounded.

Well, definitions are generally clear, so if the author provides one, it's somewhat verifiable because it's a straightforward explanation. But without a reference or example, it's not fully justified. So maybe it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nHelpfulness. The reviewer is asking for clarification, which is helpful but vague.

The reviewer suggests the authors underestimate the use of GNNs in industry and could elaborate on negative societal impacts. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions. The reviewer points out a specific issue: the lack of honesty in mentioning the limitation. They also suggest a possible improvement by elaborating on negative impacts. However, the suggestion is a bit vague\u2014like \"could elaborate\"\u2014which isn't explicit. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out exactly what to do.

So, this is borderline actionable because there's an implicit action but it's vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about the authors' underestimation of GNNs in industry. But where is this information in the paper? The review doesn't specify a particular part of the paper, like a section or figure. It's a general comment. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. They only mention it in a general sense, which doesn't help them know exactly what to fix.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer makes a claim that the authors underestimate the use of GNNs. They back this up by stating that GNNs are widely used. This is a claim, and it's supported by common knowledge, so it's verifiable. The reasoning is clear and uses a well-known fact, so this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

It mentions that the projection head's performance is impacted but doesn't specify how. So, the action here is pointing out an issue, but it's not explicit about what needs to be done. That makes it implicit. Since it's not clear, the actionability is low.

The comment is making a claim by suggesting that the model might not generalize. To verify this, the authors would need to test other focusing distances, which is a logical reasoning step. There's no external reference provided, but the reasoning is clear. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's supported by logical reasoning but lacks an external source.\n\nHelpfulness. The review is pointing out a potential limitation in the model's generalization. It's clear and actionable, but it doesn't provide specific suggestions on how to improve it.

The reviewer talks about style being instance-specific and content transferable, referencing external work.

At L384, the suggestion is to mention an inequality, which is specific. At L431, it's suggesting a change in notation, which is clear. So both are explicit and concrete. Therefore, this should be Highly Actionable (5).\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review points to L384 and L431. At L384, it's referring to |Y_t - Y_{t-1}| \\leq c_t almost surely, which is a specific mathematical expression. At L431, it's about notation, which is also specific. So the review is fully grounded because it's pointing to specific parts of the paper. It's also specific because it's not just mentioning a section but specific equations and notation. So this should be Fully Grounded and Specific (5).\n\nVerifiability. The review points are suggestions, so they are claims. At L384, the claim is that the user should mention the inequality, which is supported by logical reasoning about the importance of clarity. At L431, the claim is that \\mu_t should be \\tilde \\mu_t, which is supported by logical reasoning about notation consistency. Both are well-supported with clear reasoning, so this should be Fully Verifiable (5).\n\nHelpfulness. The review provides clear suggestions for improvement, both in terms of adding a specific mathematical expression and correcting notation. These are actionable and directly address potential issues in the paper.

The first part is a specific, explicit action\u2014changing a figure reference. The second part, attaching proofs, is a bit vague because it doesn't specify how or where. So, it's partially actionable but not fully explicit. I think this is borderline actionable because the first part is clear, but the second isn't detailed enough.\n\nNext, Grounding_specificity. The review refers to \"each theorem and corollary\" and \"its corresponding proof.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper these are, so the grounding is weak.

The user is asking which 50 classes to pick and how to choose them. They also question if the verbs are action verbs as per Levin. This doesn't give a clear action or specific suggestion. It's more of a question than a directive, so it's not actionable. Maybe a 1 or 2 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity.

The comment is explicit because it directly tells the author what to do. It's also concrete because it specifies exactly which line to fix. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions a specific line and points out a specific typo.

The specificity is also high because it clearly states what's wrong. Therefore, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the typo exists. The justification is that it's a typo, which is common knowledge. There's no need for external references or logical reasoning beyond recognizing the mistake.

It points out that the previous framework isn't limited to raw-level selection and mentions representation learning in the appendix. The reviewer suggests improving the feature selection with representation learning. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if this is explicit or implicit. The reviewer is suggesting an improvement but doesn't specify exactly what to do. They mention considering representation learning but don't give a clear method or step. So, it's implicit because the authors have to infer how to apply it. Since it's not explicit, it's borderline actionable. I think that's a 2 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about Section 4.2 and the previous framework, referencing specific parts like Line 167-174 and the appendix. They mention representation learning but don't tie it directly to a specific part of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or feature. It's more general, so I'd rate this a 3.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer suggests considering representation learning but doesn't provide evidence or references to back this up.

It's a yes/no question, but it doesn't provide any specific instructions or actions on how to do that. So, the authors aren't given any actionable steps. They might not know how to proceed, which makes this unactionable. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the text input\" and \"four text elements of an object.\" It's pretty vague about which part of the paper it's addressing. The authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is, so this isn't fully grounded. It's more of a general question, so I'd give it a 2 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a question, not a claim. Since it's a factual statement without any justification or evidence, it doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability. So, this would be an X for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is a question without any guidance. It doesn't help the authors by providing specific advice or pointing out issues.

The review is asking about specific parts of the algorithm, like lambda_t and epsilon. It's referring to Equation (7) and specific terms, so it's fully grounded.

So, this would be **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that there are too many discourse relations. They're suggesting it's either an artifact of colloquial language or something specific to UD. They don't provide any evidence or references to back this up. So, the claim is unsupported, making it **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out an issue but isn't providing any solutions or guidance on how to address it. They're just stating a problem without actionable steps. This makes the review not very helpful, so it's **Not Helpful at All**.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects.

The review point is asking about the diversity of the sample, specifically racial and economic diversity, and how well the results might generalize to other groups, especially marginalized ones. It's a good question, but is it actionable? The comment is asking a question, which is a common way to prompt discussion, but it doesn't give a specific action. So, the authors would need to figure out how to address this themselves. That makes it somewhat vague. So, I think this is Borderline Actionable because it's not giving a direct instruction but is still relevant.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions \"racial, economic diversity\" and \"marginalized groups.\" It's pretty specific about what's being addressed\u2014those exact aspects of the sample. It doesn't just say \"diversity\" but pinpoints the type of diversity and the groups to consider. So, this should be Fully Grounded and Specific because it clearly identifies the sections and issues.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a judgment about the generalizability of the results. It's suggesting that the authors consider how well their findings apply to other groups. This is a claim because it's an opinion or judgment. Now, is this justified? The comment doesn't provide any specific references or reasoning to back up the generalizability claim. It's just a suggestion without evidence. So, it's Unverifiable because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review is asking a question about the sample's diversity and generalizability. While it's relevant, it's quite broad. The authors might not know where to start addressing this. It's helpful in that it points out an important consideration but lacks specific actionable steps.

So this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim by suggesting improvements. It's not just stating a fact; it's recommending changes.

It's unclear if their methods can be practically useful for high dimensions. Their algorithm needs solving several LPs in high dimensions, but the parameter isn't easily calculable, and their experiments are on small datasets. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a lack of discussion, so it's implicit. They aren't directly telling the authors what to do, just pointing out the issue. So it's not explicit. Since it's implicit, the action isn't clear. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do. So actionability would be 1.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions computational aspects but doesn't specify which part of the paper. They don't point to a specific section or figure, just say it's unclear. So the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint where the issue is. They also don't specify what needs fixing in that part. So grounding_specificity is 1.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the methods aren't practical for high dimensions and that the parameter is hard to calculate. They back this up with the fact that experiments are on small datasets. This is a claim, and the justification is provided with examples and logical reasoning. So it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3? Wait, the justification is there but could be clearer. Maybe 4? Hmm, I think it's 4 because the reasoning is there but could be more detailed.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out a significant issue about computational feasibility and practicality. They provide examples and logical reasoning, which is helpful. It gives the authors a clear direction to consider high-dimensional aspects and the challenges with their parameter. So this is highly helpful, probably a 5.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For grounding_specificity, the reviewer doesn't mention a specific part, so it's weakly grounded. And they don't specify what's wrong there, so it's not specific. So 1.

The suggestions are clear about citing and distinguishing approaches, so that's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it?

That would make it borderline actionable because the action is clear but the implementation isn't detailed.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review talks about citing other works but doesn't specify which ones. It mentions distinguishing approaches but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It also suggests linking RL for architecture search and optimizers but doesn't name a specific section or figure.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review point is about the lack of diversity in teacher feedback, suggesting that if the feedback was auto-generated, the teacher might need to turk it or generate more varied feedback. The action here is clear: the teacher should either turk the auto-generated feedback or create more diverse feedback. The suggestions are explicit, so that's good. Also, the instructions are concrete, like \"turk\" or \"generate a few different kinds.\" So this seems actionable. I think it's highly actionable because it's specific about what to do.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions teacher feedback but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where the lack of diversity is. It's a bit vague. It doesn't mention sections, tables, figures, or any unique aspects of the paper. So the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing exactly where the issue is. It's more of a general statement.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The claim here is that there's a lack of diversity in feedback. The justification is that if it's auto-generated, the teacher might need to turk it or create more. But this is more of an opinion or judgment rather than a claim that needs evidence. There's no supporting references or logical reasoning provided. So it's not verifiable because it's a statement without backing.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review suggests solutions like turking or generating more feedback but doesn't provide specific examples or how this would improve the paper. It's vague and doesn't give clear guidance. So it's not very helpful because the authors might not know exactly what to do next. It's more of a suggestion without actionable steps.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is highly actionable because it's clear what needs to be done. However, it's weakly grounded because it doesn't specify where the issue is. The verifiability is low because it's an opinion without evidence.

So, it's not giving a clear action, just pointing out a direction. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions specific models, so it's clearly pointing out which parts of the paper to look at. It's fully grounded because it's referring to named works. But it doesn't specify what exactly to do with them, like whether the comparison should be methodological or just performance metrics. So, it's 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is making a claim by suggesting a comparison with these models. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review says, \"I can't understand the meaning of the sentence 'While a smaller j to simulate more accumulate errors along with the inference steps.' Please rewrite it.\" The author is asking for clarification. Is this explicit or implicit? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out an unclear sentence but isn't giving a direct action. So, it's implicit. Since the action isn't explicit, it's not actionable. Maybe the author needs to rewrite the sentence, but the reviewer didn't specify how. So, I'd rate this as Unactionable, which is 1.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions a specific sentence in the paper, so they've identified the part. That's full grounding because they're pointing to a unique aspect of the paper. Then, they explain what's unclear, which is specific. So, this should be Fully Grounded and Specific, giving it a 5.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is pointing out a problem in the paper but isn't providing any justification or evidence. They're just stating that the sentence is unclear. Without supporting reasoning or references, this isn't verifiable. So, it's Unverifiable, which is 1.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer is asking for clarification but isn't providing any suggestions or context. The author would still need to figure out what's unclear on their own. This doesn't help much, so it's Barely Helpful, which is 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are 1 for Actionability, 5 for Grounding Specificity, 1 for Verifiability, and 2 for Helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review point is an implicit action, as the reviewer is asking for clarification but not providing explicit instructions on how to act.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"1: Unactionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The reviewer specifically mentions a sentence in the paper, providing full grounding, and explains what is unclear, making it specific.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5: Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The reviewer's comment is a claim that the sentence is unclear, but there is no supporting evidence or justification provided.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1: Unverifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The reviewer's comment is a request for clarification but does not provide actionable suggestions or context, making it only slightly helpful.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2: Barely Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

How do you deal with concepts (multiple entity mentions referring to the same entity)? This information is currently missing from the manuscript.\" \n\nFirst, is this an explicit action? The reviewer is asking questions, which is a form of explicit action because they're prompting the authors to consider something. So, it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking about considering documents as sentences and handling entity mentions. They're not giving a specific instruction on what to do, just asking questions. So, it's more of a suggestion rather than a direct action. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable because they're prompting, but not giving explicit instructions. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer is asking about how they dealt with entity mentions. They mention \"multiple entity mentions referring to the same entity,\" which is specific. They're pointing out a particular issue in the manuscript. So, the grounding is clear because they're referring to a specific part of the paper. The specificity is also good because they're clearly indicating what needs addressing. So, this should be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is asking questions, which are opinions or suggestions. They're not making a claim that needs evidence. So, this is a normal statement because it's a request for clarification rather than a claim. Therefore, it's not verifiable. The label here would be X: No Claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is asking questions about how the authors dealt with entity mentions. While this provides some feedback, it's more of a suggestion than a constructive comment. It doesn't directly tell the authors what to do, just asks them to explain their approach. So, it's somewhat helpful because it does point out an issue, but it's not as helpful as a directive.

Well, it's stating a problem but doesn't tell the authors what to do next. So it's implicit. Now, is it concrete or vague? It's vague because it doesn't specify how to check the distribution or what needs to be done. So it's borderline actionable. I think that's a 2 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to the \"proposed dataset\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's talking about. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is, so it's not grounded. It's weakly grounded and not specific, which is a 1 for grounding_specificity.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim that the distribution is unclear. It doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem but doesn't offer any solutions or guidance. It's not helpful at all because the authors don't know what to do next.

It suggests a self-supervised approach instead. The action here is clear: propose a different method. But the suggestion is a bit vague. It doesn't specify how to implement the self-supervised approach or what changes are needed. So, it's explicit in pointing out the limitation but doesn't give concrete steps.

It's clear which part of the paper it's talking about\u2014probably the method section. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the section.

It also asks if there's an extra computation cost. This is explicit because it directly tells the author where the lack of detail is and what to fix. It's not just a question but a clear instruction, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies exactly what's missing and what needs to be done. So this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions the algorithm's lack of detail but doesn't tie this directly to a specific part of the paper. It's more of a general critique without pointing to a particular section or figure. So the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint where the issue is. The specificity is also low because it doesn't explain what exactly is wrong with the algorithm. Therefore, this should be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review makes a claim that the algorithm might have high computational costs due to the space partitioning. To verify this, the reviewer would need to either provide evidence or reasoning. However, the review doesn't back this up with data or references. It's a claim without solid justification, so it's borderline verifiable. Maybe a 2 or 3? Since it's a claim without much support, I'll go with 2.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a significant issue in the methodology and raises a valid concern about computational costs. It's clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful. The authors will likely need to address both the missing details and the potential performance impact. This makes the review very useful, so a 5 here makes sense.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

So, the comment is pointing out missing definitions but isn't giving any explicit actions or suggestions on how to fix it. It's more like a statement of a problem without actionable steps.

The review mentions W1 and W2 without clearly identifying which part of the paper they refer to. It's not specifying sections, tables, or figures, so the grounding is weak.

It also asks about the Pixel-shuffle operation and the societal impact. Some of these are questions, which are explicit actions. However, the part about limitations and societal impact is more of a suggestion rather than a clear action. So, it's partially actionable but not fully explicit and concrete.

The review refers to output-side layers, Figure 4, Pixel-shuffle, and Figure 2. It mentions specific elements like dimensionality and societal impact. However, some parts are general, like asking if Pixel-shuffle is used in super-resolution, which is a bit vague.

So, the action is implicit. The reviewer didn't tell the authors exactly which parts to improve or how to fix the issue. That makes it borderline actionable because it's vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to [1] and [2] by name, so that's full grounding. It also mentions specific algorithms like VR-MARINA and DASHA-MVR, which are unique and specific parts of the literature. So, the grounding is strong because it clearly points to the specific papers and their contributions.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that these papers satisfy Assumption 2 and have a better rate. It doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why these papers are relevant or why their results are better. There's no logical reasoning or references, so this claim is unverifiable. It's just a statement without support.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out that the literature review is missing relevant papers but doesn't suggest what to do next. It doesn't offer actionable steps or specific advice on how to incorporate these papers. So, it's not very helpful because the authors still don't know what changes to make. It's more of a criticism without a solution.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is borderline actionable because it mentions an implicit action but lacks detail. It's fully grounded with specific references. The verifiability is low because there's no justification for the claims. And the helpfulness is low because it doesn't guide the authors on what to do next.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review mentions that the literature review ignores relevant papers [1] and [2], but it does not specify what needs to be done next.

It suggests more take-away points for practitioners, which is a clear action. However, the suggestion about querying a cluster proportionally to the square root of its size is vague.

The review says, \"In section 4, I don't see the reason why separators are introduced. what additional info they convene beyond T/I/O?\" The reviewer is pointing out that the use of separators in section 4 isn't clearly explained. They want to know why these separators are added and what extra information they provide beyond the typical text-input-output (T/I/O) functionality. \n\nIs this an explicit action? The reviewer is asking a question, which is a form of explicit action because they're seeking clarification. So, it's not a suggestion to add something but rather a question to understand better. Now, is it vague or concrete? The reviewer is asking for the purpose of separators, which is a specific question. They're not just asking what separators are, but why they were used in this context. So, it's more concrete because it's a direct question about the specific use case. Therefore, this should be considered actionable because it guides the author to explain their choice of separators.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is pointing out a specific section, section 4, so they're grounded because they're referring to a particular part of the paper. Then, they're asking about the purpose of separators, which is a specific question about that section. So, they're not just mentioning the section but also asking a clear question about its content. This means they're both grounded and specific because they're addressing a specific part and clearly asking about its purpose.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The reviewer is making a claim by questioning the necessity of separators. They're suggesting that the use of separators might not add much beyond T/I/O. Is this a claim? Yes, because they're making a judgment about whether separators are necessary. Now, is this claim supported? Well, the reviewer isn't providing evidence or references, just posing a question. So, the justification is lacking. Therefore, it's somewhat verifiable because they made a claim, but there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking a question to help the author understand why separators were used. This is helpful because it provides insight into the author's choices.

Now, for concreteness: The reviewer is not just asking what Omega is but also why it's not mentioned, which is quite specific.

Now, is this explicit? Yes, they're mentioning a specific method and asking for references. But is it concrete? They don't provide details on how to implement this or suggest any references. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer is pointing out a specific method (Hamming distance) and asking for references. They clearly identify the part of the paper related to CRF and the scoring loss. So, they have full grounding because they mention the section and what's being addressed. The specificity is good because they're asking for references, which adds value. So, this would be a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that the approach is a common practice and pointing out a lack of references. They're asking for justification by providing references. This is verifiable because they're referencing external knowledge, even if it's just pointing out a gap. So, this would be a 4: Mostly Verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out a novel approach and suggesting references, which is helpful for the authors.

It's explicit because it's directly pointing out a potential improvement. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how or why the dataset should be explored more.

So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the dataset could have been explored more.

It clearly states the suggestion to avoid \"remarkable,\" so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The revised version gives a specific reason why \"remarkable\" might not be appropriate, mentioning the squished axes. So, the action is clear, and the details are provided. That makes it actionable. So, I think this is 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment is about using more objective terms. It doesn't mention a specific part of the paper, just the general suggestion.

But does that make the current review actionable? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a limitation, not giving a direct action. So, it's more of a critique than an actionable suggestion.

For the first part, it's a direct request, so that's explicit. But it doesn't specify how to find those references, like suggesting where to look or what to cite. So it's explicit but vague. For the second part, it's a question about what \"MLP\" means, which is also explicit but lacks detail on how to explain it. So overall, it's borderline actionable because the actions are clear but not detailed.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions specific sections and Figure 2, so it's fully grounded. However, it doesn't specify what exactly is wrong with the framework or how \"MLP\" is used. It's clear which parts it's addressing but lacks detail on the issues. So it's fully grounded but not specific.\n\nVerifiability. The first part asks for references, which is a claim. It needs justification, like citing academic sources. The second part asks for an explanation of \"MLP,\" which also needs justification. So both parts are claims that require verification, making them somewhat verifiable because they provide some justification but lack specific references or explanations.\n\nHelpfulness.

So, this should be highly actionable because it gives a direct instruction on what needs improvement.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is asking about Figure 2 specifically.

This makes it grounded because it accurately identifies the section being discussed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about why both entities are important. It's suggesting that just knowing the long one isn't enough, implying that the short one adds value. This judgment is supported by the understanding that both provide different information, which is a logical reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's making a claim that can be supported by common knowledge about entity detection in figures.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is asking a question and explaining the difference, which gives the authors a clear reason to improve their work. It's helpful because it guides them to focus on specific aspects of their figure, which can lead to meaningful improvements.

It's a suggestion, so it's explicit. However, it's vague because it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to conduct the experiments or what to look for. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it's clear that experiments are needed, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The comment refers to \"experiments\" and \"validated,\" which are general terms. It doesn't point to a specific part of the paper or method. So, the grounding is weak because it's not precise. It doesn't clearly identify where the issue is or what needs fixing. Therefore, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it suggests adding experiments, which is an opinion or judgment.

It explains that the upper bound is 0, which doesn't make sense. The reviewer is pointing out a discrepancy and asking for an explanation. However, the comment doesn't suggest any specific changes or actions the author should take. It just raises a question, which is more of a clarifying or diagnostic comment rather than an actionable suggestion. So, this isn't very actionable because the author isn't told what to do next. It's more of a query than a directive.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions a node with 0 neighbors but doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. They also don't provide any specific details about what's wrong with this part. It's vague, so the author can't pinpoint where the issue is or how to address it. Therefore, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the problematic section.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is pointing out a contradiction in the results. They state that the upper bound should logically be 0 but it's not, which is a claim. However, they don't provide any justification or references to back this up. The reasoning is vague, so the claim isn't well-supported. This makes the verifiability low because there's no solid evidence to support the assertion.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is pointing out a discrepancy but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions.

The review says that the training time reduction is less drastic than the parameter reduction because most gradients are still computed for early down-sampling layers (Discussion). I think the actionability here is about suggesting a change. The reviewer is pointing out an issue and giving a reason, which is explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It says \"delete 'Discussion'\". That's a clear action. So, it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer explains that gradients are computed for early layers, which gives a clear method.

It suggests an action, which is to adjust the font size. Now, is this action explicit or implicit? The comment directly states the problem, so it's explicit. Next, is the action concrete? The reviewer is telling the authors to change the font size, but they don't specify how. They don't tell the authors what size to use or where exactly the adjustment should be made. So, it's concrete in that they're pointing out the problem but not giving the exact steps to fix it. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nMoving on to Grounding Specificity. The comment refers to Figure 6, which is specific. The reviewer is pointing out an issue with a particular figure, so the grounding is strong. The comment is specific about which part of the paper is being addressed, so this is fully grounded. Additionally, the comment explains what's wrong with the figure, which adds specificity. So, grounding_specificity is 5 because it's fully grounded and very specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim because it's suggesting a change to the figure's font size. Now, is this claim verifiable? The reviewer is pointing out that the font is small, which is an objective observation. There's no need for external references or reasoning; it's a straightforward statement. So, it's fully verifiable because the claim is clear and doesn't require additional justification beyond stating the issue.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness.

The review suggests that the probability mass function (PMF) hasn't been exploited much and recommends changing the quasi-uniform distribution. It says that each learner should be considered individually, even in a BDT of different depths. The rationale here is that varying the PMF would add depth, but the reviewer is also asking the authors to consider if this is a good idea. \n\nIs this explicit? The reviewer is making a suggestion, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is pointing out a specific area (PMF) and suggesting a change, but they're not giving exact steps on how to implement this. They're just recommending a different distribution. So, it's explicit but not very concrete. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specific guidance on how to change the PMF.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about the PMF and suggests a change, but they don't specify which part of the paper they're referring to.

Therefore, this would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**, as they do mention the distribution but don't tie it to a specific part of the paper.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is making a claim that the quasi-uniform distribution is well-suited, but they don't provide any justification or evidence for this. They're just stating an opinion without backing it up. So, this is an unverifiable claim because there's no supporting reasoning or references.

The reviewer is pointing out a potential improvement but doesn't elaborate on why this change would be beneficial or how it would impact the results. They're suggesting a modification but not explaining its significance or providing examples. This makes the feedback somewhat helpful but not very detailed.

It's explicit because it tells the author what to consider. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to improve the comparison or what changes to make. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it's clear what to look into but lacks specifics on how to apply the suggestion.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions computation cost and running time, which are specific metrics. It doesn't reference a particular part of the paper, so the grounding is weak. The comment is general, not pointing to a specific section or figure. Therefore, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the point is suggesting a comparison but doesn't provide any justification or evidence.

So it's explicit but not concrete. I think that's a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions specific examples like sampling-based Bayesian methods and Hogwild. They clearly point out sections of the paper, so that's full grounding. They also specify what's wrong with those examples, which is specific. So that's a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that those examples are irrelevant and suggests alternatives.

The specificity is also good because they're asking about a particular aspect of the figure's behavior. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The claim here is that accuracy drops after a certain order due to overfitting. The reviewer is making a judgment about the paper's behavior and suggesting a possible reason.

The reviewer mentions Vision Transformer and ImageNet, which are specific parts of the paper. They're not just saying \"something's wrong,\" but pointing to specific sections and external models.

Therefore, it's not highly actionable. Maybe a 3 since it's somewhat actionable but vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer refers to Section 3 and mentions matrix norms approaching infinity. This is pretty specific because they're pointing to a particular part of the paper and a specific mathematical aspect.

The reviewer is suggesting a change for clarity, which is an explicit action. So that's good. Now, is the action concrete? The reviewer is proposing replacing 't' with the size of T, which is specific. They also explain why they think it's better for clarity, which gives the authors a clear idea of what to do. So this seems highly actionable because it's both explicit and concrete. I don't see any implicit parts here, so I think it's 5 on the actionable scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer is talking about the histogram intersection kernel and mentions replacing 't' with the size of T. They also explain that there's no added value in allowing 't' to be arbitrary. This clearly references a specific part of the paper\u2014the kernel method\u2014and explains what's wrong with the current notation. They're not just guessing; they're pointing out a specific element. So the grounding is full because they mention the kernel and the variable 't'. The specificity comes from explaining the issue with the notation, which is clear. So this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity as well.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is making a judgment that replacing 't' with the size of T would improve clarity. They're not claiming anything beyond that, just stating an opinion. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided. It's a subjective opinion, so it's a claim. However, since there's no justification or evidence, it's not very verifiable. Maybe it's borderline because they're making a judgment but not backed by anything. So I'd rate this a 2 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review point is asking about the adaptation capacity of a visual memory model. It mentions that image encoders need to produce meaningful embeddings for new concepts. For geometrically distinctive concepts, it's less of a concern because DINO representations have rich geometry. But for concepts where the class label correlates more with semantics than geometry, the reviewer is questioning if the model's adaptation capacity still holds.\n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a potential limitation and asking for clarification. It's a good question, but it's more of a probing question rather than a direct action. So, it's not explicitly stating what to do, just asking for more information. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. Maybe it's borderline because it does suggest an area for improvement but doesn't tell the author exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer is talking about the adaptation capacity, specifically regarding how image encoders handle new concepts. They mention DINO representations having rich geometric info and how class labels relate to semantics vs. geometry. This seems pretty specific because they're referencing DINO and the relationship between class labels and geometric vs. semantic features. So, the grounding is solid because they're pointing out a specific part of the model and what it entails.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is making a claim by questioning the adaptation capacity, suggesting that it might not hold for certain concepts. They're implying that the model's ability to adapt might be limited when class labels are more semantic. To support this, they could reference existing literature on model adaptability or provide examples where this might be an issue. However, the support here is vague. They're just wondering, not providing concrete evidence or references. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the depth needed for full verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out a potential limitation and asking for clarification. This is helpful because it identifies an area where the model might struggle. However, it's not providing a solution or a clear path forward. It's more of a constructive feedback but lacks the actionable steps that would guide the author on how to improve their model. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.\n\nPutting it all together, the review point is somewhat helpful because it identifies an issue, but it doesn't provide clear guidance. For actionability, it's borderline because it suggests an area for improvement but doesn't specify actions. Grounding is solid as it references specific parts of the model. Verifiability is somewhat because it lacks concrete support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review point suggests an area for improvement but does not explicitly state actions or provide concrete details on how to apply changes.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3: Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The reviewer references specific aspects of the model, such as DINO representations and the relationship between class labels and geometric vs. semantic features, providing clear grounding.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4: Mostly Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The claim is somewhat supported by general observations about model adaptability but lacks specific references or examples to back it up.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3: Somewhat Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The review point raises a valid concern and is helpful in identifying potential limitations, though it does not provide actionable suggestions for improvement.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4: Mostly Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

Also, line 264 has repeated words, which is a clear issue. The table entry in line 995-996 has a typo, and the DOI and link issues are also noted. Each of these is explicit and gives a clear action, like correcting typos or updating numbers. There's no ambiguity here, so it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review points to specific lines and table entries, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where the problems are. It's not just a general comment but directly addresses specific parts of the document.

Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"additional benchmarking tasks outside of AitW.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly these tasks should be included.

Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 3 because it's weakly grounded but specific in what it's suggesting.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it suggests adding benchmarking tasks. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the suggestion is to include more tasks, but it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's vague on why this is helpful or how it would improve the paper. So it's borderline verifiable because there's some suggestion but no solid evidence. Maybe a 2.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is suggesting adding benchmarking tasks, which is a clear improvement. It's actionable and provides a specific direction. However, it doesn't elaborate on why this is beneficial or how it would enhance the paper. So it's somewhat helpful because it gives a direction but lacks depth.

It also points out that while operator learning isn't as accurate as specialized solvers, it's more universal. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review does suggest that they should consider using a more universal approach with operator learning instead of FEniCS, which is specific. That's an explicit action. However, it doesn't tell them exactly how to implement this change, like whether to replace FEniCS entirely or integrate it with another framework. So it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear they should consider a different approach but doesn't give specifics on how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about basis functions, meshes, and stiffness matrices, which are specific parts of FEM. It also mentions operator learning methods. The grounding here is pretty solid because it references specific technical components of FEM and discusses alternative methods. It's clear which parts are being addressed.

The reviewer is asking a question but not providing any specific steps or changes the authors should make. So, it doesn't give clear instructions on what to do. I think this is borderline because it's asking a question, but it's not giving any concrete advice. So, maybe it's a 2 or 3. I'll go with 2 because it's not fully actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment is about DVP performance on videos of varying lengths. The reviewer is referring to the experimental setup, specifically the video length. They mention DVP, which I assume is a specific model or method, and the video length is a specific aspect. So, the grounding is pretty solid because they're pointing out a specific part of the paper. They're not just talking about videos in general but about their length, which is a clear and specific part. So, this should be a 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a question, so it's not making a claim. There's no suggestion or judgment, just a question. Since there's no claim, it doesn't need to be verifiable. So, this should be an X because there's no claim to verify.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer is asking a question about video length. While this could be helpful for the authors to consider, it's not providing any specific feedback or suggestions. It's more of a general observation without actionable steps.

It clarifies this in the conclusion but doesn't explicitly state it. So, the action is implied, but the reviewer doesn't tell the author exactly what to do. That makes it implicit. Since it's not explicit, it's not fully actionable.

For actionability, it's about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. The comment mentions a limited connection and a simplistic analysis but doesn't specify what changes should be made. It's vague on how to improve the connection or make the analysis more robust. So, it's not explicit, and it's not concrete. It's more of an implicit suggestion without clear steps.

The comment refers to Section 2 and mentions a theoretical analysis similar to [1]. It's specific about the sections and the comparison to an external work. The grounding is strong because it clearly points to Section 2 and references an external source. So, this should be a **Fully Grounded and Specific** score.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests that the analysis is simplistic and similar to [1].

Analyzing previous work does not constitute as a contribution.\" The first thing I notice is that it's pointing out a problem: the paper's contributions are unclear. But does it give the authors a clear action to take? It suggests that analyzing previous work isn't enough, but it doesn't specify what the authors should do instead. So, it's not giving an explicit action. It's more of a statement pointing out an issue without providing a solution. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it does hint at a problem but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. So, I'd rate this as 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions \"the major contributions\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where the issue lies. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or aspect of the paper.

The suggestion about code availability is clear, so that's explicit. Next, is it concrete? It tells the authors to make their code public, which is a specific action. So, it's both explicit and concrete. That should give it a high actionability score, maybe 5.\n\nMoving on to grounding_specificity. This aspect is about how specific the comment is regarding the paper. The review is asking about the code's availability, which is a separate issue from the paper's content. It doesn't directly reference any part of the paper, like a figure or a section. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's more about a tool (code) related to the research, which isn't part of the paper itself. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be low, maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nVerifiability is next.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review says, \"For Figure 1, are the figures generated by real experiments or artificially? If they are artificially generated, can authors conduct some real-world experiments to support the phenomenon occurred in these figures? This would be an important evaluation of the proposed method.\" \n\nFirst, is this an explicit action? The reviewer is asking a question, which is a common way to prompt an author to clarify. So it's explicit. Now, is the action clear? The reviewer is suggesting that if the figures are synthetic, the authors should do real experiments. But it's a bit vague on how to implement this. They don't specify what kind of real experiments or how to analyze the results. So it's not very detailed. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but lacks concrete steps. So I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer is asking about Figure 1 specifically. They mention \"Figure 1\" by name, so that's clear. They also suggest real experiments, which relates to the figure's content. So the grounding is strong because they pinpoint the figure and the issue. Then, they specify what needs to be done, which is conducting real experiments. That adds specificity. So this should be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nVerifiability. The claim here is that the figures are either real or synthetic. The reviewer is suggesting that if they're synthetic, the authors should do real experiments. This is a judgment about the paper's quality and suggests an improvement. The justification is that real experiments would better support the phenomenon. This is logical reasoning and a common-sense argument. So it's well-supported. Therefore, this is 5: Fully Verifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review is asking a question and providing a suggestion. It's helpful because it points out a potential weakness (synthetic figures) and offers a constructive improvement. It's clear and actionable, though maybe a bit brief. So it's 4: Mostly Helpful.\n\nI think that's a thorough evaluation. Each aspect was considered based on the definitions provided, and I tried to apply them accurately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review point is an explicit action but is vague on how to apply it.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review says that the assumption among classes is not practice. It mentions that the formulation is somewhat trivial but highlights optimization and theoretical analysis. I'm trying to see if this is actionable. The comment points out an issue but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. It's more of a statement pointing out a problem without providing clear steps. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit comment, which is borderline actionable because it suggests a problem but doesn't give a clear action. So, I think it's a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review talks about assumptions among classes not being in practice. It mentions the formulation's triviality and optimization. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to, like a particular section or table. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. The specificity is also low because it doesn't detail what's wrong. So, this would be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review states that the assumption is not in practice and mentions optimization and theoretical analysis. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up these claims. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1 on verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out that the assumption is not practical and mentions the formulation's triviality. It suggests looking into optimization and theoretical analysis. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide specific actionable steps. The authors might understand there's an issue but won't know exactly how to fix it. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says that the evaluation results are based on only three trials, which isn't significant. It suggests that statements like \"our performance is at least two standard deviations better\" don't make sense. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a limitation in the methodology. They're suggesting that the results shouldn't be reported because the sample size is too small. But does this give the authors a clear action? It seems more like a critique rather than a direct action. The authors might need to consider increasing the sample size or explaining the limitation, but the comment doesn't specify how to do that. So, it's not very actionable because it's more of a suggestion without a clear next step.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions three trials but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It talks about statistical significance but doesn't clearly identify the section or figure in the paper. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. They know it's about the evaluation results, but not the exact part. Therefore, it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the results are based on only three trials, which is not significant. The claim is that statements like the one mentioned don't make sense. Is this justified? Well, the reviewer is citing the lack of significance as a reason why such statements shouldn't be made. But is this supported by external references or logical reasoning? It seems like the reviewer is making a judgment based on their understanding of statistics, which is a common knowledge point. So, it's somewhat verifiable because they're using their knowledge to support the claim, but it's not very robust.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a methodological limitation but doesn't offer a clear solution or improvement suggestion. It's more of a critique than a helpful suggestion. The authors might need to address the issue, but the review doesn't provide actionable steps. So, it's not very helpful because it doesn't guide the authors on what to do next.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat helpful but lacks clear actionability, grounding, and verifiability.

The review mentions a shallow comparison and specifically points out two missing papers. It's explicit about the action, so that's good. It also gives concrete details about the missing papers, which makes it actionable. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review clearly references prior work by mentioning two specific papers. That's full grounding because it accurately points to the sections or aspects of the paper. It also specifies what's missing, so that's specific. Therefore, it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The claim here is that the comparison is shallow and two papers are missing. The justification is that prior work is relevant, but it doesn't provide specific references or examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it mentions the issue but lacks supporting evidence.\n\nHelpfulness. The review identifies a problem and suggests improvements, which is helpful.

It mentions that the paraphrase similarity view does better but lacks analysis on how other views differ. The reviewer suggests an example but doesn't go into more detail. So, the action here is pointing out a lack of understanding, but it's vague. It doesn't tell the author exactly what to do next. It's more of a question than a clear instruction. So, I think this is **Borderline Actionable** because it's pointing out an issue but not giving a direct action.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about the paraphrase similarity view performing better but doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. They mention an example but don't clearly identify the section or the unique aspect. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing exactly where the issue is. The specificity is also low because they don't explain what needs fixing in that part.

The review refers to a specific paper (Ni et al.) and mentions the need for detailed results on model size. It's not just a general statement; it's pointing to a particular part of the paper.

The review says that the motivation for the Newton algorithm is lacking because it's just a 1D line search on a convex function, comparing it to bisecting line search. It suggests experiments to measure impact on runtime. Explicitly, the reviewer is pointing out a specific area for improvement: adding experiments. So that's an explicit action. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer does suggest exactly what experiments to run, so it's not vague. Therefore, this should be **Highly Actionable** (5).\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions that the Newton algorithm is a 1D line search, which is a specific part of the paper. They also suggest experiments, which are directly related to the algorithm's analysis. So the grounding is clear and specific. This should be **Fully Grounded and Specific** (5).\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the Newton algorithm's motivation is lacking. They support this by pointing out that 1D line search is basic and suggesting experiments. The reasoning is logical, and the suggestion for experiments is a common justification. So this is **Mostly Verifiable** (4).\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer provides clear suggestions for improvement, specifically suggesting experiments to measure the impact.

It's pointing out a potential issue with the method. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is making a statement about a possible problem, but they're not giving a direct action for the authors. They're just pointing out a concern. So, it's implicit. Since it's not giving clear instructions, it's not actionable. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions \"Equation 8\" and talks about dynamic factors. They're referring to a specific part of the paper, which is Equation 8. So, they've identified the section, which is full grounding. Then, they explain what the issue is, which is specific. So, this should be 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is making a claim that subtracting s from dynamic information could cause loss of data.

It mentions that 21 event types were selected from Freebase and asks about the coverage of 33 event types in the ACE data. \n\nIs this an explicit action? The reviewer is pointing out a concern, which is an explicit statement. But is it actionable? They're asking about the selection criteria and coverage, which the authors can use to improve their understanding.

The grounding here is pretty explicit because they're directly referencing specific datasets. They're not making educated guesses; they're clearly stating what they're referring to. So, this has full grounding because the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue lies.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim about the generalizability concern. They're suggesting that the method's application is limited because only 21 out of 33 event types are used. This is a claim, and it's supported by the mention of Freebase and ACE datasets. They're providing some justification by referencing specific datasets, so this is somewhat verifiable. It's not fully verifiable because they don't explain why these specific datasets were chosen or how it affects generalizability beyond just stating the numbers.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is raising a concern, which is helpful because it makes the authors aware of a potential limitation. However, the suggestion is quite vague. They're asking about the selection criteria and coverage but don't provide concrete steps or explanations.

It says the model has 4 modules but doesn't specify how big each is. Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. \n\nLooking at the definitions, an explicit action would be if the reviewer told the authors exactly what to do. Here, the reviewer is asking a question, which is a common way to get the authors to think about it themselves. That's more of an implicit action. But is it actionable? Well, it's prompting the authors to consider the size, but it doesn't give a specific solution. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still have to figure out what to do next. Maybe they need to look up literature or adjust their model. So, this is borderline actionable because it's not giving a direct instruction but is still asking for a consideration.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer is talking about the number of hourglass modules, which is a specific part of the model. They mention the model consists of 4, so that's pretty grounded. However, they don't specify what's wrong with that number or how it compares to others. So, while they've identified the part, they haven't told the authors what to do about it. That means the grounding is specific but not fully because the issue isn't addressed.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The comment is a claim because it's making a judgment about the model's size. But is it supported? The reviewer is asking a question, which is more of a suggestion than a claim. They're not providing evidence or reasoning, just asking. So, this doesn't meet the criteria for verifiability because there's no justification given. It's more of a request than a claim that needs support.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is asking about the model size but doesn't provide any specific advice. It's a question that could be useful but doesn't give actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful because it does prompt the authors to think, but it's not fully helpful because it lacks concrete suggestions.

The review suggests changing the dimensions of the projection matrices from $A_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m_i \\times d_i}$ to $A_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_i \\times m_i}$. It's clear what the change is, so that's explicit. The rationale is that the dimensions must be $d_i \\times m_i$ to project a tensor of size $d_1 \\times d_2 \\times \\ldots \\times d_p$. The reviewer also mentions that they might be wrong, which adds a bit of uncertainty but still provides a clear direction. So, this is explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable. I'd give this a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer points out that the dimensions are necessary for projection, which directly relates to the specific part of the paper. They mention the tensor $T$ and how the matrices need to match its dimensions. This is fully grounded because they're pointing to a specific section of the paper and clearly state what's wrong. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer provides a logical explanation of why the dimensions must be $d_i \\times m_i$. They reference the tensor's structure, which is a well-known concept, so this is thoroughly supported. The reasoning is clear and robust, making it fully verifiable. I'll score this a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer's comment is very specific, pointing out a critical issue with the matrix dimensions that affects the projection of a tensor. They also acknowledge uncertainty, which adds value by encouraging the authors to double-check. This provides clear, actionable feedback, making it highly helpful.

The review says that the claim is misleading because it doesn't mention that prior work like ClimateBench or ClimateSet does similar things. It suggests PACE as a solution. So, the comment is pointing out a problem with the claim by providing context. But does it give the authors a clear action? It tells them that their approach is similar to existing work, which is an implicit suggestion that maybe they should consider those prior works. So, it's not explicitly telling them what to do, just pointing out a potential issue. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions specific prior works, which clearly identifies the part of the paper it's addressing. It also explains what's wrong with the claim by referencing those works. So, it's fully grounded because it's pointing to specific sections or elements, and it's specific because it explains the issue clearly. That would be a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is making a claim that the prior work exists and that their approach is similar. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just stating that these prior works exist without supporting it with data or citations. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or proof given. That would be a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a potential issue with the claim but doesn't suggest how to fix it. It doesn't provide actionable steps or solutions. It's more of a criticism without offering improvement guidance. So, it's not very helpful.

It also advises condensing the network architecture figures to two and using the space for visuals. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is giving a suggestion to condense figures and use space for visuals, which is clear. However, they don't specify exactly how to do this, like whether to remove certain figures or add specific ones. So, it's explicit in terms of the action but vague on the details.

It suggests using corpus residual value to detect this. I think the action here is clear: check if the test example is crucially different. But is it explicit? Yes, it's stating what to do. Is it concrete? It suggests using a method, which gives a clear action. So I'd say it's highly actionable because it's explicit and gives a direct method.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions Figure 8 and the patient's background. It's referring to a specific figure and a unique aspect (different background).

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review says that sparsity isn't desirable and mentions that a larger network without sparsity might perform better. It suggests that sparsity isn't useful because it can't be practically implemented. Hmm, this seems like it's making a point but doesn't give a clear action. The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't telling the authors what to do about it. So, it's not actionable because there's no specific change or suggestion. I think this would be a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about sparsity and FLOPs but doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper they're referring to. They mention the training process and computational efficiency but don't tie it directly to the work being reviewed. This makes it weakly grounded because it's a bit vague about the exact section or figure. So, I'd give this a 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim about sparsity being desirable and provides some reasoning about FLOPs and practical implementations. They do back up their argument with some logic and mention computational efficiency, which is a form of justification. This seems somewhat verifiable, so I'd rate it a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review raises valid points about the impracticality of sparsity but doesn't offer concrete suggestions on how to improve the model. It's more of a critique without actionable steps. This makes it somewhat helpful but not fully so. I'd rate this a 3.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything. The review is clear in its arguments but lacks specific instructions.

The design is not quite new, based on the fact that attention for motion learning has been widely used in video understanding.\" The comment is pointing out that the design isn't novel because motion attention is already used elsewhere. Now, is this actionable? It mentions the lack of novelty but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. They might need to explain how their work differs or how they improved upon existing methods. So, it's explicit that there's a problem but doesn't give a clear action. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear there's an issue, but the action isn't detailed.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment talks about motion learning being widely used, but does it specifically point to the part of the paper being discussed? It just mentions it generally, so the authors might not know exactly where to look or what to improve. That means the grounding is weak because it's not specific to the paper's sections or unique aspects.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment states a claim that the design isn't novel because motion attention is used elsewhere. It doesn't provide any evidence or justification for this claim. There's no reference to external works or logical reasoning, so it's unverifiable. The authors won't know if this is a valid criticism without more support.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a valid concern about novelty but doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements. It's clear and identifies an issue, but it lacks depth and actionable advice.

Yes, it tells them exactly how to reduce whitespace, but it doesn't specify how. So it's explicit but not very concrete.

So, it's explicit but not concrete. I think this would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable because it's clear what's wrong but lacks detailed steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific datasets like FlatCam Face and Head-pose detection, which are cited by their authors. It also suggests alternative datasets but doesn't tie them to the paper's content. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to the specific sections or aspects of the paper. It's more general, so I'd rate this a 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that the chosen datasets are poor choices and suggests alternatives. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up these claims. It's just an opinion without justification, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out weaknesses and suggesting improvements, which is helpful. It's clear and provides direction, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this a 3: Somewhat Helpful because it's clear but could be more comprehensive.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

Now, for actionability, it's about how clear and direct the suggestion is. The comment is explicit about the problem and suggests a fix, so that's good. It doesn't just say \"improve\" but specifically points out what's wrong and what should be there. So, it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly what to change.

It's asking for training methods and numerical illustrations. Explicitly, it's giving a clear action: check conservation properties. But does it tell exactly how to do it? Maybe not, so it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. So I'd rate it 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to Hamiltonian systems and conservation properties. It's specific about the type of systems and the properties, so it's well-grounded. It mentions numerical illustrations, which adds clarity, so I think it's fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim about whether F^\u2020 can conserve properties.

The point mentions expecting various tasks beyond link predict and the importance of PE. It doesn't specify what needs to be changed or how to implement it.

The review talks about tasks beyond link predict but doesn't mention the specific part of the paper or any particular issue. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where to focus. Therefore, it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part.

The reviewer is pointing out that 'OAA' isn't referenced, which is an explicit statement. So, the action is clear: check if 'OAA' is referenced. But is it vague? The reviewer doesn't tell the authors exactly where to look or what to do. They just mention that 'OAA' isn't referenced and suggest the appendix might have more content. So, it's not fully explicit because the authors still need to figure out where to start looking. Therefore, it's borderline actionable. \n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions Figure 3 and 'OAA' specifically. They point out that 'OAA' isn't referenced, which directly relates to the paper. They also talk about the appendix, which is a specific part of the document. So, the grounding is pretty solid because they're pinpointing a specific figure and a specific element within it. They're not making general comments, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is making a claim that 'OAA' isn't referenced. They're suggesting that the appendix might have more content or the caption is out of date. To verify this, they could refer to the methods or references section where 'OAA' should be listed. They might also check the appendix for additional content. So, they're providing some justification, but it's not very detailed.

The review says that L107-114 is speculative or overly opinionated and suggests it should be a remark, discussed in the Discussion, or removed. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment is pointing out a problem but doesn't specify what to do about it. It's vague because it doesn't give concrete steps or where exactly the issue is. So, it's not explicit because it's just stating a problem without a clear action. It's also not concrete because it doesn't tell the author how to fix it. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at an action but doesn't provide the details. So, I'd give it a 2 for actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment mentions L107-114 but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It's unclear because L107-114 is a range of lines, and without more context, the author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the section. It doesn't provide specific details about what's wrong either. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific, which would be a 2 for grounding specificity.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a judgment that the section is speculative or opinionated and suggests moving it elsewhere. This is a claim because it's an opinion or judgment about the content. Now, is this claim supported? The reviewer is stating their opinion but isn't providing evidence or references to back it up. There's no logical reasoning or external references, so it's not verifiable. It's borderline because it's a claim but lacks justification. So, verifiability would be a 2.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment is pointing out an issue but doesn't provide specific advice on how to fix it. It's vague and doesn't help the author improve the paper beyond just pointing out the problem. It's not actionable or specific, so it's not very helpful. It's more of a directive without guidance, so it's barely helpful. Therefore, helpfulness would be a 2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For actionability, the comment is explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give concrete steps. So, it's borderline actionable. For grounding, it's not specific about the part of the paper, so weakly grounded. Verifiability, since it's a claim without justification, is borderline.

It would be interesting to see development set trends with respect to these hyper-parameters.\" \n\nFirst, is this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is suggesting looking into development set trends, which is a clear instruction. So that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer isn't just saying to look into something; they're also pointing out that PM+CL behaves differently. That gives a specific direction. So it's both explicit and concrete. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions \"development set trends\" and refers to PM+CL. They're pointing out specific hyper-parameters, so they're clearly addressing a specific part of the paper. They're not vague or making educated guesses. So this is fully grounded. Also, they're specifying what needs to be addressed, which makes it specific. So this is a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is making a claim by suggesting looking into development set trends. They're providing a clear justification by pointing out the behavior of PM+CL. This justification is logical and specific, so it's well-supported. Therefore, this is a 5 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is providing a clear suggestion that's directly helpful to the authors. They're not vague; they're pointing out a specific area and offering a constructive improvement. This should be a 5 for helpfulness.\n\nI think all these aspects are 5 because the review is clear, specific, and provides actionable feedback.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review explicitly states an action to look into development set trends and provides a specific direction by highlighting PM+CL's behavior, making it concrete.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The review explicitly mentions 'development set trends' and refers to PM+CL, clearly identifying the specific part of the paper and what needs improvement.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The review contains a claim about the need to investigate development set trends, supported by pointing out PM+CL's distinct behavior, making it thoroughly justified.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The review provides a clear, specific suggestion to improve the paper by addressing hyper-parameter interactions, making it highly helpful.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests reporting flops or model size but doesn't specify how. For actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer mentions the issue with figure 5 but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They suggest adding more metrics but don't outline how, like whether to calculate flops or mention model size. So, this is implicit because the authors still need to figure out the actions themselves. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. Maybe a 3 since it's somewhat actionable but vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The comment points out a problem with figure 5 but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It just says \"the main metrics\" without clearly linking it to the figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint the exact section. It's not fully grounded. Maybe a 2 here because it's weakly grounded but mentions the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the figure is hard to understand and suggests adding specific metrics. This is a claim because it's an opinion or suggestion. The justification is that adding flops or model size would help, which is logical reasoning. They're providing examples of what to add, so it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe a 4 since it's mostly verifiable with minor gaps.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment addresses a clear issue with the figure and provides actionable suggestions, like adding specific metrics. It's not just a complaint but offers concrete ideas. The authors would find this helpful because it directly relates to the figure's clarity and suggests specific improvements.

It doesn't specify what exactly is missing or how to fix it. So, it's not explicit because it's unclear. It's also not concrete because it doesn't provide specific steps or examples. Therefore, it's borderline actionable. \n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to the \"questions section below\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or method is missing details.

It's more of a suggestion than an explicit action. So, it's not giving a clear step-by-step action. It's vague because it's just recommending an experiment without specifying how or where to apply it. So, I think this is borderline actionable because it's implying an action but not detailing it enough.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions \"standard setting on real-world datasets\" and \"variants focusing on dealing with over-smoothing.\" It's pretty specific about what part of the paper it's addressing\u2014evaluation under standard settings and comparison with specific variants. So, the grounding is solid because it clearly points to the evaluation part and the comparison with GCNII. The specificity is also good because it's not just mentioning something vague but pinning down the exact areas: real-world datasets and specific variants. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a suggestion about an evaluation but isn't claiming anything as a fact. It's just stating what they want to do. There's no claim here, so it's an X for verifiability. There's no justification or evidence provided, just a suggestion.\n\nFinally, Helpfulness. The review is suggesting an experiment but isn't providing any concrete feedback on how it would help or what the implications are. It's just pointing out a potential area for the authors to look into. So, it's somewhat helpful because it does suggest an area of improvement, but it's not detailed enough. It lacks depth and specifics on how this would benefit the authors or what the expected outcomes are.

I think this is an explicit action because it directly points out the missing part. But is it actionable? The reviewer is pointing out a problem, but does it tell the authors how to fix it? Not exactly. They need to know how to introduce the inference strategy, which is vague. So, it's explicit but not concrete. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions the absence of a subsection but doesn't specify where it should be added or what exactly should be included. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's more of a general comment without specifics, so I'd rate this as 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting the absence of a subsection. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's just a statement without support. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

The results are even lower than some simple early methods like f-CLSWGAN [4] and f-VAEGAN-D2 [5]. More explanations can be given.\" \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The comment here is more of a question and a comparison. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. It's asking for an explanation but doesn't provide concrete steps or actions. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe it's somewhat vague because it's prompting for more information rather than giving a clear fix.

The review mentions specific methods like f-CLSWGAN and f-VAEGAN-D2, which are cited. It's clear which papers are being compared, so the grounding is strong.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review says, \"It's not clear why the freezing is used in MLS selection. If adaptive is good, why not just use adaptive method to choose the subset?\" The actionability here is explicit because it directly suggests using the adaptive method. So the authors know exactly what to do. It's not just a question; it's a clear recommendation. So I think this is highly actionable because it provides a specific solution.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions \"freezing is used in MLS selection\" and \"adaptive method.\" It's clear which part of the paper it's referring to, so the grounding is fully grounded. It also specifies what's missing, which is the reason for using freezing instead of the adaptive method. So this aspect is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is a claim that suggests using the adaptive method instead. It provides a reason but doesn't cite any external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion. So it's somewhat verifiable because it's supported by the idea that adaptive is good, but it's not explicitly justified why freezing is needed. Maybe the authors would need to infer that since adaptive is good, freezing isn't necessary, but it's not fully supported.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review points out a clear issue and suggests a solution. It's helpful because it guides the authors to consider using a better method. It's somewhat detailed but could be expanded, so it's moderately helpful.

The comment is explicit about wanting to see if the knowledge-CLIP model can handle similar analyses by adding negation or changing entities. That's a clear action the authors should take. It's not vague; they know exactly what to do. So, this is explicit and concrete. Therefore, it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions a specific existing work and suggests a particular analysis. The authors can pinpoint the section of their paper where they should explain this comparison. They're not just making a general statement; they're referring to a specific part of the literature. So, this is fully grounded because they're addressing a specific external work and a specific methodological aspect.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting a specific analysis. The justification provided is that such an analysis would be interesting and beneficial. However, the reasoning is a bit vague.

Is this explicit? Yes, it's a direct suggestion. Now, is it concrete? The review doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done, like whether they should provide examples or a detailed explanation. So it's not very detailed. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable because the action is clear, but the specifics are missing. So I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"how novel values in the test set are handled.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a particular section or figure. So the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The specificity is also low because it's a general suggestion without details. So this would be a 2 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it suggests an improvement area. Now, is this claim supported? The review doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning. It just recommends explaining novel values. There's no reference to existing practices or literature, so it's not verifiable. This would be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest an improvement, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide specifics on what needs to be done.

It also mentions that the writing is too confusing. For actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions or suggestions. Here, the reviewer is suggesting a solution but doesn't specify how to implement it. They mention using an external knowledge base but don't provide concrete steps. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which is vague. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because the action is suggested but not clearly outlined.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review talks about using an external knowledge base and figure 3. It doesn't clearly reference a specific part of the paper or figure. It's more general, so the grounding is weak. The comment doesn't specify what needs to be addressed in that part, so it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim that points 1 and 2 can be avoided with an external knowledge base. They also say the writing is confusing. To verify, we need to see if the claim is supported. The claim is that using an external knowledge base can avoid points 1 and 2, but without specific references or examples, it's unclear. Also, the confusion about writing quality isn't backed by evidence. So, it's borderline verifiable because there's some support but it's vague.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

It also suggests trying other loss functions like mean or NDCG. The problem is that these are more questions than suggestions. They don't provide clear actions the authors should take. So, this isn't very actionable. It's more of a probing question, which doesn't help the authors improve their work directly. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific things like glove embeddings and loss functions. It's clear which parts of the paper it's referring to, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is also high because it's suggesting specific methods and metrics. So, this should be a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review points out specific parameters and suggests trying different loss functions. It doesn't provide much justification or references. The suggestions are vague, so it's not very verifiable. The authors would need to do more research to understand the impact of these changes.

It suggests ensuring the baseline is fully tuned with similar resources for a fair comparison. \n\nFor actionability, it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are.

It also mentions that Eq1 doesn't look like perplexity but like cross-entropy. The action here is pointing out that the definition is wrong and that Eq1 is cross-entropy. This is explicit because it directly states the issue. It's also concrete because it specifies that Eq1 is cross-entropy, so the authors know exactly what to check.

It's not just saying \"some details are missing\" but pinpoints the area. Then, it asks about probabilities and inference, which are specific aspects of the model.

The review says the LUQ is straightforward once the goal is clear and mentions that the approaches in Sec. 5 are standard and similar to previous literature. It claims the main contribution is showing a simple combination achieves good accuracy, not proposing new techniques. \n\nFor actionability, it needs to be explicit and concrete. The comment mentions standard approaches but doesn't suggest specific changes. It's vague on how to improve. So, it's not actionable because authors don't know what to do next. Maybe they should add more details on how to implement the combination or what specific techniques to use. So, this is borderline actionable because it hints at a problem but doesn't give clear steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to Sec. 5 as standard approaches but doesn't specify which parts of the paper or what exactly is missing. It's too vague about the issue. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the referenced part. It doesn't clearly identify what's wrong either. Therefore, this is weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The comment makes a claim that the main contribution is showing a simple combination works, but it doesn't support this with evidence or references. It's just a judgment without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing to prove the claim is valid.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out that the main contribution is showing existing techniques suffice, which is somewhat useful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps.

I wish to see some training losses.\" The first part is a question, which is an explicit action, so that's good. But the second part, \"I wish to see some training losses,\" is a request for information. It's not giving a direct action but rather a desire for evidence. So, it's not fully actionable because the user is asking for something rather than providing a solution or change. Therefore, it's borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions \"the differentiable Sinkhorn\" and \"training losses.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this refers to. The mention is vague, so the grounding is weak. The user is talking about a general desire for training losses without pointing to a specific section or figure. So, grounding is weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by asking if it's stable and wanting to see training losses.

It mentions that automatic scores aren't effective and human evaluation is too costly. It also points out that FFAEVAL and similar systems aren't suitable for evaluating a single dialogue system. \n\nHmm, so the comment is suggesting that the proposed method isn't applicable. But does it give a clear action for the authors? It says \"I don't think it can be used to evaluate a single dialogue system,\" which is a statement, not an action. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next or how to improve their system. So, it's not actionable because it's more of an opinion without providing a specific change.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about the relevance to the abstract and mentions specific systems like FFAEVAL. It seems like it's pinpointing the issue by referring to these systems, so it's grounded because it's specific about the part of the paper it's addressing. Then, it explains why these systems aren't suitable, which is specific to the problem. So, it's both grounded and specific because it clearly identifies the problem and the systems involved.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that these arena-based systems aren't suitable. It's suggesting that they can't evaluate a single system, which is a claim. Now, is this claim supported? The reviewer is pointing out that these systems are designed for comparing dialogue systems, not evaluating one. So, the reasoning is logical, but does it provide examples or references? It doesn't cite any external sources, so it's somewhat justified but lacks specific examples or references. Therefore, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a logical reasoning but no concrete evidence or examples.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is critical about the proposed method but doesn't offer any suggestions or improvements. It just states that the method isn't suitable. This means the authors don't get any actionable feedback or guidance on how to proceed.

It suggests that the authors should adjust their comparison. This is explicit, so it's actionable. It also gives a concrete reason for the slowdown, which is the number of samples. So, this should be highly actionable because it's clear and specific.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions 2x samples and running speed, which are specific parts of the paper. It doesn't make any vague claims about the impact of samples on speed. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the relevant section and explains the issue clearly.\n\nFor Verifiability, the review makes a claim that seeing 2x samples slows down the training, and that this could make comparisons unfair. It supports this with logical reasoning about the number of samples affecting speed. It doesn't cite external references, but the logic is solid.

So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment references a specific equation (lines 81-82) and clearly states what's unclear about it. The grounding is strong because it directly points to the section mentioned. The specificity is also high as it explains exactly what's wrong and what needs to be defined. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the paper's clarity and suggests a correction. It's a claim that needs justification.

Also, it's vague because it doesn't specify where exactly the change needs to happen or how to implement it. So, it's not very actionable. Maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions P in equations and the appendix. They point out where exactly the confusion arises. So, the grounding is pretty specific because they're pointing to exact sections. But the specificity of the comment is about what's wrong, not how to fix it. So, it's specific about the part being addressed but not clear on the fix. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim that P is inconsistently used. Is this claim verifiable? The reviewer is pointing out the issue but isn't providing evidence or justification. They're just stating that there's confusion. So, it's not really verifiable because there's no supporting reasoning or references. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment is clear about the issue but doesn't offer solutions. It's pointing out a problem without suggesting fixes. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nPutting it all together, I think Actionability is 2 because it's implicit and vague. Grounding Specificity is 3 because it's specific about the sections but not clear on the fix. Verifiability is 1 because it lacks justification. Helpfulness is 3 because it's clear but lacks solutions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review points out an inconsistency in the use of P but does not specify how to fix it, making the action vague.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The review identifies specific sections (Appendix, equations) where the issue occurs but does not clearly suggest fixes.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The review states a problem but lacks justification or evidence to support it.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The review highlights a problem but does not offer actionable solutions.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It also says that the authors addressed their weaknesses and raised their score because the authors explained why the chosen baseline makes sense. They also ask if there's a way to test beforehand. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The comment suggests adding other baselines but doesn't specify how or where. It also asks a question, which is a bit vague. So, it's not explicit because it's more of a suggestion without concrete steps. It's also not very concrete because it doesn't tell exactly how to implement this change. So, I think this is **Borderline Actionable** because it does hint at an action but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review talks about adding baselines from specific references. It mentions \"other works discussed in related work [29, 5, 6]\" and \"the authors' explained why the chosen baseline makes the most sense.\" It also asks a question about testing beforehand. \n\nHere, the review does identify the specific part of the paper related to the Related Work section. It's not weak grounding because it's clear which part is being addressed. However, it doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done, like suggesting a particular method or providing examples. So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it mentions the area but doesn't detail the action.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a suggestion to include other baselines, which is a claim. It's asking for a question, which is a bit vague. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's not well-supported. Therefore, it's **Unverifiable** because the claim is made without any supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review suggests adding baselines and asks for testing methods. It's helpful because it points out an improvement area, but it's vague. It doesn't provide detailed suggestions or ask for clarification.

It mentions that dynamic weighting is important. The comment suggests that the author should consider dynamic weighting. Is this explicit? Yes, it's directly telling them to consider something. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It tells them to consider dynamic weighting but doesn't specify how. So it's explicit but not concrete. Therefore, it's 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment refers to works in multimodal fusion and mentions dynamic weighting. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or section it's addressing. So the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part. But it does mention dynamic weighting, which is specific about the issue. So it's weakly grounded but specific. That would be 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim that dynamic weighting is important. It's suggesting a change, which is a claim. Now, is this claim verifiable? The comment doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states that dynamic weighting is important. So there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. So the score is 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a limitation and suggesting a solution. It's helpful because it guides the author to consider a better approach. It's somewhat helpful because it doesn't give detailed steps, but it's still useful. So the score is 3: Somewhat Helpful.\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The review is clear about the issue and the solution, so actionability is good but not fully concrete.

The review mentions that the task loss is named L_task, which is clear. It suggests renaming it to L_class. That's explicit, so it's not implicit. It's also concrete because it tells the authors exactly what to do. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review points out a specific part of the text where the task loss is referred to as L_task. It clearly identifies the issue in that section, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is good because it mentions the exact place and the problem with the naming. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim that the naming should be changed. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's not verifiable. It just states the issue without supporting evidence.\n\nHelpfulness. The review is pointing out a specific issue but doesn't suggest any solutions or improvements beyond renaming. It's clear and identifies a problem, so it's somewhat helpful.

The review says that Fig 1 is not consistent with Fig 2 because Fig 2 has one encoder-decoder per auxiliary task, while Fig 1 uses a single shared encoder-decoder for multiple tasks. The action here is pointing out a discrepancy between two figures. Is this explicit? Yes, it clearly states what's wrong. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how this affects the paper or what changes should be made. So, it's explicit but vague on the action needed.

The reviewer is pointing out that the connection isn't immediately obvious and is asking for a clearer explanation. This is an explicit action because the reviewer is directly pointing out the issue.

Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions Lemma 7 but doesn't specify which part of the paper it refers to. They just say \"Lemma 7\" without any context. This means the reviewer can't confidently pinpoint where Lemma 7 is located or what it refers to.

The reviewer suggests looking into the novel properties, but it's vague. They don't tell the authors exactly what to do, like specific changes or how to implement the overstated claims.

Again, this method is simple, but it is highly unclear why it is effective.\" The first part mentions that no 2-hop neighbors are included, which is an explicit action. But then it says the method is simple and why it's effective is unclear. That part is vague because it doesn't specify what needs to be done or how to apply this information.

It also suggests considering if the training was on a specific stimulus and whether changing the cycle duration would affect adaptation times, referencing another study. The action here is clear: the authors need to explain the training method and explore the effect of cycle duration. The rationale is explicit, so it's not implicit. It also provides concrete details about the stimulus and the reference, so it's not vague. Therefore, this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions Figure 7 and specifically asks about the training stimulus, which is a specific part of the paper. It also references another study, which is a unique element. The grounding is strong because it directly points to the figure and the stimulus, and the reference is specific. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting that changing the cycle duration might affect adaptation times, referencing Smirnakis et al.

It mentions specific examples like H->N and H->B using less data than H->N+B, and H->N->H using less than H->N+B->H. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The reviewer is pointing out a methodological issue but isn't suggesting how to fix it. They're asking for clarification on the data usage but not providing explicit steps on how to adjust the comparisons. So, it's not explicit because they're not telling the authors what to do. It's more of a question, which is implicit. Since it's implicit and vague, it's not highly actionable. Maybe a 3 or 4? But since it's not giving concrete steps, I think it's 3: Somewhat Actionable because it does suggest an action but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer is talking about the comparisons in Table 2, specifically pointing out that some comparisons use less data. They mention H->N vs H->N+B and H->N->H vs H->N+B->H. This means they're clearly identifying the specific part of the paper (Table 2) and what's wrong with it (using less data in comparisons). So, they're fully grounded because they're pointing to a specific section and the issue within it. The specificity is good because they're explaining what needs to be addressed in that part. So, this should be a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the comparisons should use the same amount of data. They're suggesting a methodological improvement but aren't providing external references or logical reasoning beyond their judgment. They're just stating their opinion. So, this is a claim without supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. Therefore, it's a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out a methodological issue in the paper but isn't providing concrete suggestions on how to adjust the comparisons. They're asking for clarification rather than giving actionable steps. This is helpful in that it identifies a problem, but it's not very detailed or actionable.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review point suggests adding something at the end, which is a bit counterintuitive. It then asks if the authors are applying Algorithm 1 with T=1 or T=2 and what happens for larger T. It also mentions that usually iterative algorithms run until a criterion is met with T >> 2, so this might be a point of interest. Then it points out that line 224 doesn't reference Laplacian eigenmaps and wasn't cited in the introduction. It also mentions Figure... but the figure reference is incomplete.\n\nSo, the review is making several suggestions. The first part is about the counterintuitive nature of adding something at the end, which is explicit. Then it asks questions about the algorithm's iterations, which is another explicit action. It also points out a missing citation, which is another explicit action. However, the part about the figure is incomplete, so the reviewer isn't clear on what exactly is missing there. \n\nLooking at the explicit vs. implicit criteria, all the points about the algorithm and the citation are explicit. The figure part is vague, so it's not fully actionable. Since most of the actions are explicit, but one is implicit, this might be considered **Somewhat Actionable** because the majority of the suggestions are clear, but not entirely.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions Algorithm 1, which is specific, and discusses iterations, which is also specific. They point out a missing citation, which is specific to that part of the paper. The figure reference is vague, though, as it just says \"Figure\" without specifying which one. So, the grounding is pretty good because they're pointing to specific sections and a specific issue with a citation. The figure part is a bit vague, but overall, it's grounded because they're referring to specific parts of the paper.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the algorithm's behavior with different T values and the missing citation. For the algorithm part, they're explaining why larger T is usual, which is logical reasoning. For the citation, they're implying that the absence of a reference is a problem, which could be justified by the importance of proper citations. The figure part is vague, so it's not well-supported. Therefore, the claims are somewhat verifiable because they have some justification, but the figure part lacks support, making it **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out specific issues the authors should care about: the algorithm's typical behavior and a missing citation. These are clear and actionable points. The figure part is unclear, so it's not as helpful. Overall, the review provides meaningful feedback on key aspects of the paper, so it's **Somewhat Helpful** because it addresses important points but could be clearer on the figure reference.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on how explicit, grounded, verifiable, and helpful the points are.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review point explicitly suggests adding something at the end, which is a clear action.

It's making a suggestion about moving content elsewhere. Is this explicit? Yes, it's stating that the section is included but doesn't explain why. So it's explicit. But is it concrete? The reviewer is suggesting where the content should go but doesn't specify how to do that. They're implying that the section is redundant or not necessary, but they don't provide a clear action on what to do. So it's not fully actionable because the author still needs to figure out what to do next. \n\nSo, on the actionability scale, it's probably **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but vague on how to apply the suggestion.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about Section 2.1, which is about Batch Normalization, and mentions CBN. It also talks about the ResNet architecture. The reviewer is pointing out that the section doesn't provide motivation for CBN and that the ResNet description could be better used elsewhere. \n\nIs the reviewer clearly identifying the section? Yes, they mention Section 2.1 and the ResNet part. So that's full grounding. But does it specify what needs to be addressed? The reviewer is saying that the section is included but not explaining why, so they're pointing out a lack of motivation. It's specific in pointing out the section but not exactly what's wrong with it. So it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's clear which part is being addressed but doesn't delve into the specifics of the issue.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review is making a judgment that the section lacks motivation and that the ResNet description should be elsewhere. It's not presenting a claim that needs evidence. It's more of an opinion or suggestion. So there's no claim here, which means it's an **X: No Claim**.

It suggests that the statement about initialization needs to be more carefully stated. So, the action here is pointing out that initialization should be pre-trained, but it doesn't give specific steps or how to implement it. That makes it somewhat vague. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't provide concrete details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions two specific lines, L200 and L303. At L200, it says \"for every arm a\" implies a single optimistic parameter. I think this is pointing out a potential issue with the method, but it's a bit vague. It doesn't explicitly tell the author what to do next, like suggesting an alternative or explaining why this is a problem. So, it's not giving a clear action. Then at L303, it suggests choosing T_0 = m Sqrt(T) and provides an improved condition. This part is more actionable because it gives a specific formula and an improvement. However, the first part is vague, so overall, it's somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nMoving on to **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to \"for every arm a\" at L200, which is specific to the method's parameters. That's good grounding because it clearly points to a specific part of the paper. At L303, it talks about choosing T_0 and improving the condition, which again refers to specific mathematical expressions. So both parts are grounded, but the first part is a bit vague in explaining the issue, while the second is more specific in suggesting an alternative approach.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains claims. At L200, it's suggesting that having a single optimistic parameter might be an issue, which is a claim. It's not supported by external references but is based on logical reasoning about the implications of having a single parameter. At L303, it proposes a specific formula and an improvement, which is another claim. This claim is supported by logical reasoning and provides a specific example, making it more verifiable. So overall, the claims are somewhat verifiable but could be improved by more detailed reasoning.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review does provide some helpful feedback by suggesting an alternative formula and an improvement, which is actionable. However, the first part is vague and doesn't clearly explain why having a single optimistic parameter is an issue. The second part is more helpful because it gives a specific suggestion.

These are clear actions, so that's explicit. The changes are also concrete, like replacing \"Despite of being compact\" with \"Despite being compact.\" So, this should be highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. Each correction targets a specific part of the paper. For example, line 2 refers to a typo, line 56 to a term, and so on. The changes are specific to each line, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is also clear because each fix is directly related to the line mentioned. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the review points are just suggestions without any justification. They don't provide any reasoning or references, so it's unclear how these changes would help. Therefore, it's unverifiable because there's no support for why these fixes are necessary or beneficial.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review suggests adding experiments comparing the proposed method with other non-linear blocks. It's an explicit action because it directly tells the authors what to do. But it's vague because it doesn't specify how to implement these experiments or what results to expect. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under Borderline Actionable because it's clear that experiments should be added, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions specific alternative non-linear blocks, which means it accurately points out which parts of the paper need to be addressed. It's fully grounded because it references specific models. However, it doesn't specify what exactly should be done with these experiments, like whether they should be compared in terms of performance or efficiency. So, it's Fully Grounded but not fully Specific.\n\nVerifiability. The review is making a claim by suggesting that such experiments would be beneficial. It's somewhat verifiable because it's a logical suggestion based on common knowledge in neural networks, but it doesn't provide specific references or examples. So, it's Somewhat Verifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review is pointing out a potential improvement area, which is helpful. It's clear and suggests a meaningful change, so it's Somewhat Helpful because it doesn't mention any negative aspects of the current method, just a suggestion for improvement.\n\nI think that's a good breakdown.

It's explicit about suggesting an area to improve, so that's explicit. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to change their work or what specific parts to focus on. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment talks about the algorithmic aspects but doesn't specify which part of the paper to focus on.

The comment mentions Fig. 5 and asks about the differences between 'valid' and 'orig'. It's explicit about the part of the paper, so that's full grounding. Then, it's specific because it's asking about the differences, which is a clear request.

The review suggests including a comparison to methods in computer vision but points out that loss-based sampling is more applicable. It says these aren't always applicable without a supervised setup but can be adapted. Is this explicit or implicit? It's making a suggestion but not giving a direct action. So, it's implicit. Is it concrete? It mentions specific methods and their applicability, so maybe it's somewhat actionable.

The review talks about methods in computer vision and loss-based sampling. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing, just mentions the comparison. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or issue. It's more general, so I'd give it a 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that loss-based sampling is more applicable but doesn't provide evidence or references. It's vague, so it's not well-supported. That would be a 2: Borderline Verifiable because it's making a statement but lacks justification.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is suggesting a comparison but doesn't provide detailed feedback or actionable steps. It's vague and doesn't really help the authors improve much.
