The review points out that the author didn't consider the AND operator or element-wise max, which are related to union and intersection. The reviewer is asking why the chosen options (OR and MIN) were better. The reviewer is suggesting that the author should have considered AND and MAX instead. \n\nIs this an explicit action? Yes, the reviewer is suggesting alternatives. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking why the author didn't use AND and MAX, but they don't specify how to apply this feedback. They just suggest alternatives without detailing how to implement it. So it's not very concrete. Therefore, this is borderline actionable because the action is implicit.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is talking about operators in a technical context, but they don't specify which part of the paper this refers to. They mention the operators but don't tie them to a particular section or figure. So the grounding is weak because the reviewer can't confidently pinpoint where the issue is. They mention the operators but don't clearly identify the part of the paper being addressed.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is making a claim that the author should have considered AND and MAX instead of OR and MIN. This is a claim. Now, is this claim supported? The reviewer is asking why the author didn't consider these operators, but they don't provide any justification or references. It's just a suggestion without backing. So it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nHelpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a potential improvement but is vague about why these operators were chosen.

It also mentions that line 242-244 says the data has syntactic information. The reviewer is pointing out that the description is vague and could be more precise. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit or implicit. The reviewer is making a suggestion to mention Li et al. (2019a) earlier, which is explicit. However, the comment doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this change. It just suggests revising the description. So, it's explicit in terms of the action but vague on the details. That would fall under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it's not fully actionable without more specifics.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer mentions Li et al. (2019a) but doesn't explicitly state which part of the paper they're referring to. They just say \"these already have syntactic information.\" So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint the specific section or data they're talking about. They might have to make educated guesses, which isn't ideal. So, this would be \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\"\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim that the data is a subset of Li et al. (2019a). They also suggest mentioning the source earlier, which implies a judgment about the clarity of the authors' description. This claim is supported by external references (Li et al. 2019a), so it's well-justified. Therefore, it's \"Fully Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer provides a clear point about the data being a subset and suggests a specific improvement. They also reference an external source, making the feedback actionable and well-supported. This should be \"Highly Helpful\" because it gives the authors a clear direction and cites a relevant source.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 2 (Weakly Grounded and Not Specific)\n- Verifiability: 5 (Fully Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 5 (Highly Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

(2020) and didn't use domain adaptation methods from Section 8. It also suggests improvements in line 277. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out specific missing comparisons, which is explicit. However, the suggestion to improve line 277 is a bit vague. It doesn't specify how to do that, like suggesting a particular method or providing more details. So, it's not fully actionable because the action isn't clearly defined. Maybe the reviewer should have mentioned, for example, adding a comparison analysis or citing a specific technique. So, this is probably a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but vague on the exact steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions Campos et al. (2020) and Section 8. That's pretty specific. They're not just saying \"they missed something,\" but rather pointing to exact references. So, the grounding is strong because it clearly identifies the sections or works being referred to.

These are clear claims. For verifiability, the reviewer references specific papers and sections, which are external references. They also suggest improvements, which can be logically inferred. So, the evidence is solid and well-supported.

However, it doesn't provide specific instructions on how to implement these changes. For example, it doesn't say whether to use mean, max, or another pooling method. So, while the action is clear, the details are vague. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.

It mentions the pooling method and the equation, which are specific parts of the paper. It also asks about the identity of E_i, which is a specific element within those sections. The grounding is strong because it clearly references the paper's content. The specificity is good because it's not just a general critique but targets particular issues.

That makes it somewhat actionable because the action is clear, but it's vague on the implementation. So, I think that's a 4 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review points to specific tables (5 and 3) and a figure (6). It's accurately pinpointing the sections, so that's full grounding.

But does it give specific steps? It doesn't mention exactly what kind of analysis to perform or how to implement it. So it's explicit in asking for more analysis but vague on the specifics. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nMoving to **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer refers to Figure 3 by name, which is good because it's a specific part of the paper.

They also claim that DeiT-B doesn't outperform DeiT-T and S in certain datasets, and that the 0.1% improvement isn't significant. \n\nAre these claims supported by evidence? The reviewer references specific figures and datasets, which provides some grounding. However, the claim about the 0.1% improvement being insignificant is a bit vague. It could be more specific about what constitutes significance. Also, the reasoning is a bit general, saying that 0.1% isn't significant without providing a threshold or context.

I think this is a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to Figure 3e, which is specific, so grounding is good. It also mentions the loss term from Equation 13, which is a specific part of the paper. The specificity is high because it clearly points to the relevant section and the exact issue. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that illustrating the loss term would be beneficial. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's not well-verified. It's more of a suggestion without justification, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment suggests an improvement but doesn't elaborate on why it's beneficial or how it helps the authors. It's vague, so it's not very helpful. I'd rate this as **2: Barely Helpful** because it points out an area for improvement but doesn't provide enough detail or reasoning to make it truly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 2\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

It also says the engineering is mostly good but doesn't provide clear instructions on what exactly needs to be changed or improved. So, the action is implicit because the reviewer is pointing out that the work builds on previous methods but doesn't specify how to improve upon them. Therefore, it's not explicit, making it borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to NCNet and Sparse NCNet by their names, which are specific models. However, it doesn't clearly state which part of the paper or figure it's addressing. The mention is general, so the grounding is weak because the reviewer isn't pinpointing a specific section or figure.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that the current work is a small contribution over previous methods.

It also points out that previous work considers multiple vulnerabilities. The reviewer is suggesting that the authors should argue if one-at-a-time is an intended use case. \n\nIs this explicit? The reviewer is making a suggestion about the authors' approach, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is pointing out that previous work considers multiple vulnerabilities, which gives the authors a clear direction to compare their method. So, I think this is actionable and concrete. Therefore, it should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about the authors considering a single vulnerability, mentions previous work with multiple, and questions ecological validity. The reviewer is clearly referring to specific parts of the paper, like the methodology section where the authors discuss their approach. They also mention previous work, which is a specific reference. So, the grounding is strong because the reviewer is pointing to specific sections and comparing to prior research. This should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the authors should consider multiple vulnerabilities. They provide a reason by referencing prior work, which is a logical justification. They also point out that their current approach might be limited, which is a clear explanation.

It then provides specific examples, like questions about converting a stacked LSTM to a sequential one and an unclear sentence about hierarchical layers. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does give specific questions, which are explicit. However, the questions are quite detailed and might require the author to infer how to address them.

It's explicit about the issue and the solution, so that's explicit. The action is clear: perform cross-dataset experiments. It's also concrete because it tells the authors exactly what to do. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to Figure 1 and specific datasets like SEMAINE and UNBC. It accurately points out the issue in these specific sections, so the grounding is full. It also clearly explains what's wrong in these parts, making it specific. So this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests cross-dataset experiments as a solution. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion. It's a bit vague because it doesn't explain why cross-dataset experiments are necessary or how they would be conducted. So it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out a significant issue and suggests a clear solution. It's helpful because it guides the authors on what to test, which is a meaningful improvement.

And it looks like an incremental engineering paper.\"\n\nStarting with **Actionability**:\n- The comment states that it's difficult to follow the motivation and describes the paper as incremental. These are explicit actions, so the reviewer is pointing out a clear issue.\n- However, the comment doesn't provide specific steps or suggestions on how to improve the motivation or structure. It's vague in terms of action.\n- Therefore, it's **Borderline Actionable** because it mentions an action but doesn't detail how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**:\n- The reviewer mentions \"the motivation of this paper\" and describes it as incremental. This is a specific part of the paper.\n- The comment clearly identifies the issue without needing further clarification, so it's **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**:\n- The claim here is that the paper is incremental. This is a subjective judgment, but it's based on the reviewer's observation without external references.\n- There's no supporting evidence or logical reasoning provided, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**:\n- The comment points out a clear weakness in the paper's structure and describes it as incremental, which is helpful for the authors.\n- However, it doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements, making it somewhat vague.\n- So, it's **Somewhat Helpful** because it identifies an issue but lacks detailed guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It also asks specific questions about model performance and accuracy. The explicit actions are clear: adding explanations and addressing the questions. However, the instructions are somewhat vague, like asking for accuracy numbers without specifying which task. So, while the actions are explicit, the details are a bit lacking. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear but not fully detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points to Figure 3 and asks about the correspondence between learning curves and M-PHATE. It also questions whether worse models cause structural collapse and asks for specific accuracy numbers. The mention of Figure 3 is explicit, so the grounding is strong. The questions are specific about the learning curves and model performance, which makes the specificity clear. Therefore, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review includes opinions and suggestions, which are claims. It mentions why more sentences are needed and what accuracy means, which requires justification. The reasoning is logical, and external references aren't cited, but the explanations are sufficient. So, this should be \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because it's justified but lacks some external support.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions and asks specific questions, which helps the authors improve. However, it's a bit vague about the accuracy numbers and doesn't specify which task. While it's helpful, it could be more detailed.

It's explicit about the action\u2014adding a specific visualization. But does it give clear instructions on how to do it? It says to plot sparsity vs. performance, which is specific. So, it's explicit and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The comment mentions a plot comparing sparsity and performance. It's specific about the parts of the paper, like sections 3.2 and 4.1. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is the comparison. So, it's fully grounded and specific. That's a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that PEFT methods are compute-constrained and that a plot would show SGC's benefits. It supports this with general knowledge about PEFT methods targeting compute constraints. It's logical and provides some justification, so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out a limitation of the paper and suggests a visualization to address it. It's clear and actionable, offering a specific improvement.

The review point is asking for an example of data type, specifically clarifying what \"support data\" and \"predicted training count data\" mean. It also suggests adding the model used in the appendix. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit or implicit. The reviewer is asking for definitions, which is a direct request, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer isn't just asking for definitions; they also want an example of \"support data\" and \"predicted training count data.\" So, they're not just asking what the terms mean but also to provide examples and suggest adding the model. That makes the action quite concrete because the reviewer is giving specific tasks the authors need to perform. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is asking about specific data types and model details. They mention \"support data\" and \"predicted training count data,\" which are specific terms from the paper. They're also suggesting adding the model to the appendix, which is a specific part of a paper. So, the reviewer is clearly pointing out specific sections or elements in the paper where the authors need to make changes. That means the grounding is strong because they're not just talking about the paper in general but about specific parts. Therefore, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that the authors should provide examples and add the model. Now, is this claim well-supported? The reviewer is asking for specific actions, which are common knowledge in academic writing\u2014providing examples and detailing methodology. They're not citing external references, but the suggestions are based on standard academic practices. So, while it's somewhat supported by common knowledge, it's not explicitly citing any external sources. Therefore, this might be a 3 for verifiability because it's somewhat justified but lacks specific references.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking for specific improvements, providing clear examples, and suggesting adding model details. This is very actionable and constructive. The authors will know exactly what to do, which is helpful. It's not just vague advice but specific and detailed.

So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details on how to implement the suggestion. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review references specific works (NN-based clustering algorithms) and mentions the paper's simplified settings. It also points out that findings are already reported elsewhere, which clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed. The grounding is strong because it references specific sections and external work. The specificity is also good because it explains why the contribution is lacking.

It's pointing out that the process of calculating \u03bb isn't clear. The reviewer is suggesting that the authors should explain how \u03bb is computed. \n\nIs this an explicit action? Yes, because the reviewer is directly asking the authors to explain a specific part of their work. So that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking for a detailed explanation of how \u03bb is computed, which would require the authors to provide specific steps or methods. So, it's not vague; it's asking for precise information. Therefore, this is highly actionable because it's clear what the authors need to do.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity.

It accurately references the relevant part of the paper, so it's fully grounded. It also clearly explains the specifics, so it's specific. That's a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment makes a claim that the sum should be 1/d, providing a logical reasoning about why it's incorrect. It references mathematical principles, so it's well-supported. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear and directly points out two specific issues, providing actionable steps.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that words like \"somewhat\" and \"good generative ability\" are used, but the author is concerned about whether replacing entities and relationships would lead to the right ones being plugged in. The review suggests that even with beam search, only 77% of results have ground truth logical forms. It then asks about the percentage of correct entities when there's no ground truth. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives a clear action or suggests something the author can do. The review does suggest checking the percentage of correct entities, which is an action. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to check or what steps to take. It's more of a question than a directive, so it's not very actionable. Therefore, it's probably **Borderline Actionable** because it does hint at an action but doesn't provide much detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to section 4.3 and 4.4 but doesn't explicitly name which part of the paper it's talking about. It mentions entities and relationships but doesn't clearly identify where they are in the document. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint the referenced part. It's not fully grounded since it doesn't clearly specify what needs fixing.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review makes a claim by questioning the reliability of replaced entities and suggesting a need for checking percentages. It provides some reasoning by mentioning beam search and 77% accuracy, which is logical. However, it doesn't cite external references or provide specific examples, so it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. It's probably **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but not enough to be fully robust.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking a question about the accuracy of entity replacement and suggests checking percentages. While it provides some insight, it's more of a query than a constructive suggestion. It doesn't offer clear guidance or actionable steps beyond asking a question. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very detailed or specific.

Well, the reviewer is pointing out that if a graph has repeated vertex or edge labels, a multiset would be necessary to represent it accurately. This is a logical reasoning point, as it's based on the structure of graphs and the need to account for repeated elements. Therefore, the claim is well-supported, making it fully verifiable. So, verifiability is a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is providing a clear suggestion to use multisets in section 4.

The comment is telling the authors what to do, which is averaging results, but it's not giving specific instructions on how to do that. It's more of a directive without details. So, it's explicit in terms of the action but vague on the implementation. That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity.

The specificity is also good because it clearly states what needs to be addressed. I'd give this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review points are making claims that require justification. For example, suggesting to report averages implies that it's a good idea, which is a claim. The justification would come from explaining why averaging is beneficial, maybe due to noise reduction. Similarly, discussing decision boundaries adds value by pointing out an interesting aspect. The figure explanation is also a claim that needs to be supported by the figure's content. The verifiability here is solid because it's backed by logical reasoning and references to the figure's data.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the theoretical discussions need improvement and points out that the theorems follow from existing properties. It also suggests looking for sample complexity results. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The review does suggest specific areas for improvement and provides some direction, like looking for sample complexity results. However, it's quite vague on how to implement these suggestions. For example, it doesn't specify which parts of the algorithm to modify or how to conduct the analysis. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for improvement but lacks concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to theoretical discussions needing improvement and mentions specific properties like mutual information and DP. It also suggests looking for sample complexity results. The grounding here is pretty good because it's pointing to specific parts of the paper, like the theorems and properties related to mutual information and DP. It doesn't just say \"the paper needs improvement\" but specifically mentions sections. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the current theorems follow from existing properties and suggests looking for sample complexity results. The justification is that mutual information relates to DP, which is a well-known property. It also mentions expecting sample complexity-type results, which provides a logical reasoning. The references to mutual information and DP are external and well-established, so the claim is thoroughly supported. This should be a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides specific suggestions for improvement, mentions relevant properties, and offers a clear direction to look for sample complexity results. It's helpful because it guides the authors to focus on specific areas and provides a rationale for why those areas need improvement. While it could be more detailed, it's still quite helpful. So, I'd rate this as 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 5\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It's suggesting that the difference isn't significant and is asking for clarification. Is this an explicit action? The reviewer is making a request for clarification, which is an explicit action. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify exactly what part needs clarification. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is pointing out a difference between two methods but isn't clearly pinpointing which part of the paper they're referring to. They mention RetinaNet and ATSS but don't specify sections or tables. So, their grounding is weak because they can't exactly identify the referenced part. Maybe a 2 here.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim about the methods not having a significant difference. They're suggesting that RepPoints regresses distance to feature maps, while anchor-based regresses [w, h] to the center. They're asking for clarification. The claim is that the difference is not significant, but the reviewer doesn't provide evidence or justification for this claim. It's more of an opinion without support. So, maybe a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking for clarification on a point they're unsure about. They're pointing out a potential difference but are vague on what exactly needs clarification. This could be helpful, but it's not very detailed. It might help the authors if they can clarify, but as it stands, it's somewhat helpful.

The review says, \"When talking about the Fourier modes as numbers, perhaps clarify if these are reals or complex.\" The action here is suggesting clarification. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies that the Fourier modes should be clarified as real or complex numbers. There's no ambiguity here, so it's highly actionable. So, I'd give this a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions Fourier modes as numbers but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It's a general suggestion, so the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded, so this would be a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a claim because it suggests a change (clarifying Fourier modes). It's well-supported by common knowledge about mathematical definitions. It doesn't require external references, so it's thoroughly justified. Therefore, verifiability is 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is clear and directly points out a specific area for improvement. It's actionable and provides a clear direction for the authors. It doesn't seem vague or lacking in guidance.

The action is explicit because it tells the author exactly which figure to correct. Additionally, it provides concrete instructions on how to fix the LaTeX, so it's not just a suggestion but a clear step-by-step action. This makes it highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment specifically mentions \"Fig. 1\" and \"Fig. 5.1,\" which are exact references in the paper. It doesn't make any general statements or guesses about which figure is problematic. Therefore, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the specific parts of the paper being addressed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests a change in LaTeX formatting. While this is a claim (a suggestion), the justification provided is vague. It mentions that putting the label after the caption will fix the bug but doesn't explain why this is the case or reference any external sources. So, the verifiability is somewhat lacking, but it's better than nothing. It's not fully verifiable because the reasoning isn't detailed enough.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment provides a clear and specific correction, which is helpful. It guides the author on exactly what to change and how, which is beneficial. However, it doesn't address other potential issues or suggest improvements beyond this fix, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive.

It doesn't specify what changes to make, like suggesting which method is better or why. So, the action is implicit because the reviewer is pointing out a need for more information but not giving explicit instructions on how to improve it. Therefore, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because the action is implied but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions supplementing the comparison but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model structure. It's vague about where exactly the supplement should be or what aspects to focus on. So, the grounding is weak because the reviewer isn't pinpointing the exact section or issue. It's not fully grounded since it's too general.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a suggestion to supplement the results but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is necessary. It's a claim that needs more support, but there's no backing provided. So, this is \"Unverifiable\" because there's no logical reasoning or references to back it up.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The suggestion to supplement the comparison is clear and provides a direction for the authors to improve their work.

For actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The first part about adding a reference is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. The second part about \u03a9 not being defined is also explicit because it clearly states an issue. Now, is it concrete? The first part suggests adding a reference, but it doesn't specify where or how. The second part mentions \u03a9 but doesn't explain what it is, so the authors still need to infer. So, the first part is somewhat vague, and the second is vague as well. Therefore, the overall actionability isn't fully actionable because some parts are implicit.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review talks about adding a reference next to baseline names, which is specific because it refers to a particular part of the paper (tables). It also mentions \u03a9 in Corollary 1, which is specific because it refers to a particular section. So, both parts are grounded and specific. The authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is, so grounding specificity is high here.\n\nFor verifiability, the review provides some justification. It explains why adding a reference is helpful (improves clarity) and why defining \u03a9 is important (prevents confusion). However, it doesn't cite any external references or provide logical reasoning beyond the obvious benefits. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's some justification, but it's not as robust as it could be.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review offers clear suggestions on how to improve the paper by adding references and clarifying \u03a9. It's actionable and provides meaningful feedback.

So this is highly actionable. I think it's a 5 here.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions Figure 7, which is specific. It's not just a general statement; it's about a particular figure. So the grounding is full because it accurately points to the section. Then, it specifies what's wrong and what should be done.

The review mentions the Lipschitz Hessian assumption but doesn't specify which part of the paper or method this refers to. It's just a general statement without pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the reviewer can't confidently identify the referenced part.

The comment is explicit about the improvement but lacks details on the methods used. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to ODA and mentions the improvements without pinpointing the exact part of the paper. It's a bit vague, so it's not fully grounded. That would be a 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that ODA improved performance and speed but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's a claim without support, so it's Unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out the improvements but doesn't explain how or why, making it somewhat helpful.

It mentions that the lines \"No adapt\" or \"Finetune\" are covered by others without extra explanation. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is directly pointing out the issue, so that's explicit. But does it give a clear action? It suggests the authors should explain those lines, which is a clear action. So, it's explicit and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions Figure 4 and points out specific lines. They're not just saying the figure isn't clear but are specific about which parts are covered. So, they've grounded it by referring to a specific part of the paper. They also clearly state what's wrong, which adds specificity. So, this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the figure lacks explanation. They're suggesting the authors add more detail. Is this supported by external references or logical reasoning? Well, the reviewer is relying on their own judgment and understanding of what makes figures self-explanatory. It's logical but doesn't cite external sources. However, it's still verifiable because the reasoning is clear.

It's explicit about the action (providing analysis) but doesn't specify how to do it. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the impact of additional parameters and computational effort, which is specific.

This seems like **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests the authors should provide an analysis, which implies they need to back it up. However, it doesn't specify how they should do this, like with experiments or references. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. That would be a **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a significant issue (the lack of discussion on impact) and suggests a solution.

It suggests providing a mathematical characterization. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The comment here is pointing out a problem (ambiguity in definition) and suggesting a solution (mathematical characterization). It's explicit in pointing out the issue and suggests a fix, so that's good. But does it give clear instructions on how to do that? The suggestion is to provide a mathematical characterization, but it doesn't specify how, like a formula or method. So it's explicit about the action but vague on the details. That would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about approximation error being ambiguous unless one has seen the table. It doesn't mention any specific part of the paper, like a particular section or figure. It's making a general comment about the definition needing clarification. So the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part. It's not fully grounded since it's not clearly identifying where the issue is. Therefore, this would be **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because it doesn't pinpoint the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the definition is ambiguous. It's a claim that needs to be supported. The justification is that without seeing the table, the definition is ambiguous. This is a logical reasoning justification, so it's somewhat verifiable. It's not fully verifiable because it's not citing external references or providing examples, but it's better than nothing. So the score here would be **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out a clear weakness in the definition and suggests a solution.

It also says the model is simplistic because only certain edges are changed. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The comment explicitly states the limitation of the model (only 1 node per time step) and mentions that it's simplistic.

It gives an example about recent chunks having temporary high utility leading to premature evictions. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with the approach, which is an explicit action. But does it give clear guidance on what the authors should do? It suggests that they should consider other factors beyond utility, but it doesn't specify what those factors are.

The comment is explicit in pointing out the missing description, so that's an explicit action. However, it doesn't specify how to describe 'p'\u2014like whether it's a Gaussian, its parameters, or any other details. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions line 135 but doesn't specify what exactly needs to be changed about 'p'. It's a general suggestion without pinpointing the specific part of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's an educated guess rather than a clear reference.

It says the regret cannot be sublinear but the proof shows T^{1/2} regret. The reviewer is asking if the prediction error over T cannot be sublinear. This is a clear question that the authors can address by looking at the proof. So, it's an explicit action, and the authors know exactly what to check. That should be highly actionable, so a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper, the proof, so they're clearly addressing a specific section.

It's explicit about the actions, like trying different models and comparing representations. It also gives concrete steps, such as fixing the generative model and optimizing only the inference part. So, this is explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific methods like SIG-VAE and VGAE, which are clearly mentioned. It also talks about optimizing the inference part, which is a specific part of the model. The grounding is strong because it points to exact sections or methods, so this is fully grounded and specific. That's a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests trying these specific models and comparing results. It's making a claim by suggesting these methods and providing some justification through the mention of different inference techniques. The evidence is there, though it's not super detailed.

It suggests that without it, predictions might depend on image size. This is a clear action, so it's explicit. The action is also concrete because it tells the authors exactly what to consider. So, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out a specific part, table 3, and mentions visualizations.

It talks about exponential dependence on M, the impact on the constant factor, and mentions that the performance is worse than standard random features. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to see if the review gives explicit and concrete actions for the authors. The review does suggest looking at Eq. (3) and Figure 1, which are specific parts of the paper. It also points out that the performance is worse than standard methods, which is a clear issue. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly what changes to make. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to adjust their methods based on this feedback. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific parts of the paper like Eq. (3) and Figure 1, which is good. It also mentions the performance being worse than standard random features, which is a specific comparison. So, the grounding is strong because it clearly points to specific sections and provides a specific comparison. The authors can easily identify where to focus their improvements.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review makes a claim that the dependence on M affects the constant factor and that the performance is worse than standard methods. It supports these claims by stating that this is a weakness of the proposed approaches. The reasoning is clear and logical, and it references the figures and equations mentioned. There's no need for external references, as the explanations are sufficient. So, this is fully verifiable because the claims are well-supported with logical reasoning and clear examples.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues in the paper and provides a clear analysis of the weaknesses.

The review does state an action\u2014comparing with other methods\u2014but it's a bit vague. It doesn't tell exactly how to do the comparison, like whether it's a figure, discussion, or something else. So, it's not fully actionable because the method of comparison isn't specified.

They also ask a question about the model's lack of sequentiality and temporal dynamics, which should be grounded because it's about the paper's specific aspects. The specificity comes from the reference and the direct questions about the paper's features. So this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific** because the part of the paper is clearly identified, and the issue is specific to the model's structure.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the model isn't sequential and doesn't capture temporal dynamics, which is a claim.

So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not pinpointing a part but does clarify the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains claims about the quantization method causing information distortion and loss of precision. It supports these claims by comparing variances and citing other works. The references are external, which adds verifiability.

At L384, it says \"Could mention that you mean |Y_t - Y_{t-1}| \\leq c_t almost surely.\" This is an explicit action suggesting the authors clarify the notation. It's clear and specific, so it's actionable. At L431, it says \"\\mu_t should be \\tilde \\mu_t, yes?\" This is a suggestion but phrased as a question, which might require the authors to infer the correction.

It's unclear if their methods can be practically useful for high dimensions. Their algorithm requires solving several LPs in high dimensions, which is a problem because the parameter isn't easily calculable, and their experiments are on small datasets.\n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives explicit instructions on what the authors should do. The review mentions that the authors need to discuss computational aspects more, but it's vague. It doesn't specify how or where to add this discussion. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's vague about how to implement this, it's not concrete.

It's more general.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review makes a claim that the authors didn't discuss computational aspects in detail and that their methods might not be useful for high dimensions. It supports this by stating that their algorithm requires solving LPs in high dimensions with an uncalculable parameter and that their experiments are on small datasets.

They mention the exact sentence they're having trouble understanding. So, the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the part of the paper, which is full grounding. They also explain what the issue is, which adds specificity. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is asking the author to rewrite a sentence but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this change is necessary. It's just a request without supporting reasoning. So, this is **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing for the suggestion.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking the author to rewrite a sentence they don't understand.

They're pointing out a lack of motivation, which is a bit vague. So, the grounding isn't fully there because they're not pinpointing exactly where the issue is. It's more of a general comment, so I'd rate this a 2 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is making a claim that the paper lacks motivation and suggests improvements.

It also mentions not providing limitations or societal impact. These are all explicit actions the authors should take. However, each of these points is a bit broad. For example, saying \"why the dimensionality remains the same after upsampling in Figure 2\" is a bit vague. The authors might need to explain this more clearly, which makes the action somewhat vague. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because the actions are clear but not entirely detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review does mention specific parts like Figure 4 and the Pixel-shuffle operation. It also refers to upsampling in Figure 2. So, the authors can identify these sections. Additionally, it talks about limitations and societal impact, which are specific aspects of the work. Therefore, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it clearly points to specific parts and issues within them.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes claims about the output-side layers, Figure 4, Pixel-shuffle, and upsampling. It also suggests the absence of limitations and impact. These claims are supported by general knowledge about research processes and the importance of these aspects.

It doesn't specify what needs to be done, so it's implicit. Is it concrete or vague? It's vague because it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to fix. So, it's borderline actionable because it's implicit and vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment doesn't mention any specific part of the paper.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point suggests the reviewer isn't familiar with DMM and DVBF in detail but understands their differences from KVAE. They ask for a more detailed presentation of the models and specifically mention that KVAE is simpler with linear state space transitions but requires time-dependent LGSSM parameters \u03b3. The reviewer is asking for a comment on the computation requirements of the three methods compared in Table 1.\n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is asking for a comparison of computation requirements, which is a clear action. However, the suggestion is quite vague. They don't specify how the computation requirements differ or what aspects (like time efficiency, computational resources needed) they want to know. So, while the action is explicit, the details are lacking. That makes it somewhat vague.\n\nSo, on the actionability scale, it's probably a 3 because it's explicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is asking about the computation requirements of the three methods. They mention KVAE's simplicity and the need for time-dependent parameters. This clearly references specific parts of the paper, like Table 1, which contains the comparison. The comment is specific about which methods are being compared and what aspect (computation requirements) they want to discuss. \n\nTherefore, the grounding is full because the reviewer can accurately pinpoint the section and the specific issue they want addressed.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that KVAE is simpler but requires time-dependent parameters. This is a judgment about the models' characteristics. The justification provided is that the state space transitions are linear for KVAE, which is a logical explanation. They also reference the need for \u03b3 parameters, which is a specific point from the paper. \n\nThis claim is well-supported with clear reasoning and specific references, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking for a detailed comparison of computation requirements, which is a significant improvement over a vague suggestion. They want enough detail to understand how each method's computational demands compare, which could help them decide which model to use. This is quite helpful because it addresses a specific need for understanding model complexities. \n\nSo, the helpfulness score is a 5 because it's clear, actionable, and provides detailed suggestions that would empower the authors to improve their work.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 5\n- Helpfulness: 5\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"No empirical validation\" and \"some experiments.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or where the experiments should be conducted. It's a bit vague. So the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly point to a specific section or figure. I'll rate this a 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting that experiments should be done. It's a subjective opinion, so it's a claim. Now, is this claim well-supported? The review doesn't provide any reasoning or references. It just recommends experiments, which is a common-sense suggestion. So it's somewhat verifiable because it's based on common knowledge, but it lacks specific justification. I'll give it a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear and suggests a specific improvement. It's helpful because it guides the authors to add experiments. It's somewhat helpful but not the highest. I'll rate this a 4.\n\nSo putting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 5\n- Grounding_specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 4\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests that the patches are just masked versions with most pixels black, which might be misleading. The reviewer also recommends using bilinear sampling for zooming. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer does mention a specific issue with the description of the patches and provides a suggestion for improvement. However, the suggestion is quite vague\u2014just recommending bilinear sampling without explaining why it's better or how to implement it. So, it's explicit about the issue but lacks detail on the fix. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer refers to equation 9 and Figure 1, which are both specific parts of the paper. They clearly point out what's wrong with the figure and suggest an improvement. So, the grounding is strong because they accurately reference the sections. The specificity is also good because they explain the issue in detail and suggest a method to fix it.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer makes a claim that the patches are incorrectly described and suggests an alternative method. They back up their claim by pointing out the discrepancy and the potential benefits of bilinear sampling. This is logical reasoning and provides a clear justification, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is clear and directly addresses a potential issue in the paper. They provide a suggestion for improvement, which is helpful. While the suggestion is vague on implementation, it's still actionable enough to guide the authors.

The review says that the training time reduction is less drastic than the parameter reduction because most gradients are still computed for early down-sampling layers. It mentions revisiting the discussion but says it's fine to delete that part. I think the action here is suggesting to delete the discussion. Is that explicit? Yes, it's clear. So it's explicit. Is it concrete? It tells the authors exactly what to do, which is to delete the discussion. So I'd rate this as 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to the Discussion section but says it's fine to delete. It doesn't specify which part of the Discussion, just that it's okay. So the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part. It's more of a general statement. So grounding_specificity would be 2 because it's not fully grounded but mentions the section.\n\nVerifiability. The claim here is that it's fine to delete the discussion. Is there any justification? The review doesn't provide any reasoning or references, just a statement. So it's not verifiable. It's more of a directive without backing. So verifiability would be 1.\n\nHelpfulness.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review mentions that the font size is small, which is an explicit action. The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue, so that's clear. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly where to look (Figure 6) and what the problem is (font size too small). There's no ambiguity here, so it's definitely actionable. So, this should be a 5 for actionability because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment refers to Figure 6, which is a specific part of the paper. The reviewer is accurately pinpointing the section, so that's full grounding. It also clearly states what's wrong with that figure, which is the font size. There's no mention of external work or vague suggestions, so it's fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to Verifiability. The comment is a claim because it's suggesting a change (improving the font size). Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a problem, but there's no justification or reasoning provided. They're just stating that the font is too small. Without any supporting evidence or explanation, it's hard to verify. So, this would be unverifiable, which is a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a specific issue in Figure 6, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague. The reviewer is suggesting to improve the font size but doesn't specify how. They might want to know if increasing the font size is feasible or if there are other considerations. Also, there's no suggestion for an alternative font or size. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully detailed. Maybe a 3 for helpfulness because it's clear but lacks depth in suggestions.\n\nWait, but the helpfulness scale goes from 1 to 5.

They suggest focusing on specific problems. The comment is explicit about the need to focus on non-decomposable loss functions and other distributed algorithms. It doesn't specify exactly how to implement this, but it's clear what needs to be done. So, it's explicit and gives a direction, but lacks concrete steps. I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what to do but doesn't tell exactly how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer points out issues in the introduction, specifically about the examples not convincing. They mention the second paragraph with Bayesian methods. The comment clearly references specific parts of the paper (like the second paragraph and ERM methods) and explains why they're problematic. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the relevant sections and explains the issues clearly. I'd rate this as **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the examples aren't convincing and suggests alternatives. The justification is logical\u2014pointing out that the loss function decomposition is a common issue and suggesting other algorithms as alternatives.

It explicitly states the action of comparing with another pre-trained model, which is clear. The action is explicit, so that's good. Now, is it concrete? The review mentions ExpertBert specifically, so the authors know exactly who to compare with. There's no ambiguity here. So, this should be highly actionable because the action is both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions ExpertBert, which is a specific model, and clearly states why the comparison is needed. The grounding is explicit because it refers to a well-known model, and the specificity is clear as it points out the advantage of CPEF's pre-training. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review presents a claim that PMEF lacks a pre-training module, which is a valid point.

It supports this claim by explaining why it's important (to avoid bias towards longer trajectories) and mentions that the current method might not be suitable for all domains.

{"generated_text": "Alright, I need to evaluate the given review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out several technical issues and suggests corrections. For example, it points out typos, incorrect abbreviations, and formatting issues. Each of these is explicit and clear, so the authors can directly apply these changes. Additionally, the suggestions are concrete, like changing \"as it a\" to \"as in a\" and fixing \"PLN\" to \"NLP.\" There's no ambiguity here, so the actionability is quite high.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific sections and tables, like Table 3, row 2, column 3, and line numbers. It also points out formatting issues in the text. The mention of the DOI number being the same as another reference and the link pointing to the next paper in the list are explicit references to parts of the paper. Therefore, the grounding is strong because it clearly identifies the sections being discussed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides clear justifications for each correction. For instance, explaining that \"as it a\" should be \"as in a\" is a logical correction. The suggestion to fix \"PLN\" to \"NLP\" is based on standard terminology. The repetition of words in a sentence is a clear issue, and the DOI and link issues are well-explained. There are no vague claims or unsupported suggestions, so the verifiability is high.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers multiple specific suggestions across different sections of the paper. Each point is actionable and directly addresses issues without being too broad. While there are several points, they are all constructive and provide clear guidance, making the review highly helpful for the authors.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores highly, with the review being very actionable, well-grounded, verifiable, and helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It also asks about iteration-wise convergence and downstream tasks like SST-2. The suggestions are specific but not explicit on how to implement the comparison. So, it's somewhat actionable because it tells the authors what to do, but it's vague on the details. I think this would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to Figure 4 by name, which is specific. It also mentions downstream tasks like SST-2, which is a clear reference.

It suggests an implicit action: the authors should avoid referencing [15] as PointNet and instead provide a proper citation. However, it doesn't specify how to implement this change, like suggesting an alternative name or where to find the correct citation. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but vague on the exact action. That makes it borderline actionable because the action is implicit and lacks detail.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review clearly mentions Figure 1 and references [15], so it's fully grounded. It also specifies what's wrong with the reference, which is the confusion caused by another PointNet paper. So, it's both grounded and specific.\n\nFor Verifiability, the review provides a claim that referencing [15] as PointNet is confusing.

It's explicit about the actions needed, so that's good. Now, are these actions clear and concrete? The reviewer is pointing out specific lines where the authors should make changes, which means the authors know exactly where to focus their edits. So, this is explicit and concrete. Therefore, the actionability is highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions specific line numbers, which means they are accurately pinpointing the sections of the paper. This is full grounding because they're not just guessing but directly referencing the text. Additionally, they're being specific about what needs clarification, so the specificity is high. This makes the grounding fully specific, so a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the clarity of certain lines and the issues with the matrix.

So, it's explicit but not very detailed on how to implement the change. That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points to Figure 2 and specific lines, 433 and 468. It accurately references these parts, so the grounding is strong. It also clearly states what needs to be fixed, which is the punctuation. That makes it fully grounded and specific, so a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests checking specific lines and figures and making the punctuation consistent. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the observation that punctuation should be consistent. It's somewhat supported but lacks depth. So, a 4 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points to specific issues and provides clear suggestions. It's helpful because it guides the authors on where to look and what to fix. It's not the most detailed, but it's still useful. So, a 4 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding 5, verifiability 4, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

The action here is clear: check if figures are real, and if not, do experiments. But is it explicit? Yes, it tells them what to do. Is it concrete? It gives a specific action, not just a suggestion. So I think this is highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment asks about the figures specifically, so it's grounded. It mentions Figure 1, which is specific. It also suggests an action related to that figure, so it's clear what part is being addressed. I think this is fully grounded and specific, so a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that the figures are artificial and recommending real experiments. It's supported by logical reasoning\u2014real experiments are a standard practice. So it's fully verifiable, maybe a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential weakness (artificial figures) and offers a constructive suggestion.

It's not asking the authors to do something, but rather giving a direct suggestion. So, it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The comment doesn't specify how to add the example or figure, like where to place them or how to create them. So, it's not very detailed on the implementation. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable because it's explicit, but not fully concrete. So, I'd rate it as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is talking about adding examples and figures to explain a concept. It doesn't mention a specific part of the paper, like a particular section or figure number. It's a general suggestion. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where to add these elements. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 2.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a suggestion, which is a claim. It's saying that adding examples would help explain the concept. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, logically, adding examples usually helps in understanding complex definitions, so there's some reasoning. However, it's a general statement without specific references or external sources. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a logical basis, but it's not well-supported. Therefore, verifiability would be 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is suggesting adding examples and figures to explain a concept. This is clear and actionable for the authors. It provides a specific direction on what to improve, which is helpful. It's not vague or too broad. So, this should be highly helpful.

It suggests comparing test accuracy but doesn't specify how. So, the action is implicit because the authors need to infer where to make the comparison. It's vague because it doesn't tell them exactly what to do. So, this is borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to Sections 3.4 and 3.5, which are specific parts of the paper.

It doesn't mention any particular section, table, or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it can't confidently identify the referenced part. It's just a general comment without pinpointing the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that zero-shot results are strange and might satisfy curiosity. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a subjective opinion without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue (zero-shot results) and suggests it's strange, which is helpful. It gives the authors something to consider, even if it's vague.

It looks like there's more content in the appendix that is missing here, or the caption is out of date.\" The comment is asking the authors to look at Figure 3 and mentions that 'OAA' isn't referenced. It suggests that something is missing or outdated. This is an explicit action because the reviewer is directly pointing out the issue. However, the comment doesn't provide specific guidance on what to do next, like suggesting a reference or explaining the missing content. So, it's explicit but vague. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer refers to Figure 3 by name, which is specific. They also mention 'OAA' not being referenced, which is a specific element. The comment clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, so the grounding is strong. Additionally, they explain what's wrong, which adds specificity. Therefore, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that 'OAA' isn't referenced and that Figure 3 might be missing content or the caption is outdated. They don't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support these claims. It's a subjective judgment without justification, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out an issue with Figure 3 and mentions missing content.

It gives an explicit instruction to mention [12] in the introduction. That seems clear and direct, so it's explicit. Also, it tells the authors exactly what to do, which is concrete. So I think this is highly actionable, which would be a 5.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions lines 29-30 and specifically points out that the authors must mention [12]. It's explicit about which part to address, so that's full grounding. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is specific. So this should be fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is a claim that the authors' framework is a fix of [12], which is supported by pointing to lines 29-30. It references specific literature, making it verifiable. The reasoning is clear, so this is fully verifiable, scoring a 5.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review provides clear feedback, mentions a specific reference, and tells the authors exactly what to do. This is very helpful because it guides them on where to add the citation.

However, it doesn't specify how to implement these comparisons, like suggesting particular metrics or providing detailed guidance. So, it's not fully actionable. It's more of a suggestion without concrete steps, so I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to specific methods like Zero-1-to-3 and point-e, which grounds the comment. It also mentions the occlusion experiment but doesn't clearly explain its relevance, just questioning its relevance. So, while it's grounded in specific references, the part about occlusion isn't clearly specified. I think this falls under **4: Fully Grounded and Under-Specific** because it mentions the methods but doesn't elaborate on the occlusion aspect.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains claims about the need for comparisons and the irrelevance of the occlusion experiment.

It doesn't specify exactly how to do this, just mentions that an explanation would be helpful. So, it's giving a general suggestion without concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I think it's a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review points out specific issues in the text and the figure. It mentions line 14 and 47, which are specific parts of the paper. It also refers to Figure 1 by name and mentions the subscripts s and t. This shows that the reviewer can pinpoint exactly where the problems are, so it's fully grounded. Also, it's specific about the issues, so grounding_specificity is 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a judgment that the explanation and figure clarification are needed. It's not suggesting a specific reason why, just stating that an explanation would be helpful. There's no supporting evidence or references, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does provide clear suggestions for improvement, pointing out specific areas and what needs to be done.

It clearly references these techniques, so the grounding is strong. It's not just a general statement but points to particular areas, making it well-grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests methods that are well-known in the field.

It also mentions describing the size and elements of G. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. It doesn't ask them to infer, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies exactly what needs to be added: dimensions and elements. So this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions adding specific details about G, X, and W. It doesn't just refer to the section but actually names the parts, so that's full grounding. It also clearly specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the size and elements. So this is both grounded and specific. That should be a 5 here too.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting additions and changes. It's supported by logical reasoning because adding these details would make the model's operations clearer. There's no external reference needed here, but the reasoning is solid. So this is fully verifiable, scoring a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions on what to add and how to describe G. It's directly pointing out areas for improvement without being vague.

It also mentions that the peak in Figure 5 isn't described. The hints are specific, so the authors know exactly where to add more details. That seems pretty actionable. It's not vague; they have clear directions. So I think this is highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points to Section 5.2 and Figure 5. It's specific about where to add content and what exactly to explain. They're not just saying \"refresh the concept,\" but rather how to interpret it in a certain way and describe the peak. So the grounding is solid because they're pinning down the sections and details.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the current explanation is enough in Section 3.1 and suggests improvements. It provides logical reasoning by stating that more detail is needed elsewhere. It doesn't cite external references, but the reasoning is clear. So it's somewhat verifiable because the reasoning is there, even if there's no external source.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions on where to add content and how to interpret it. It's specific and actionable, which means the authors will find it very helpful. They can directly apply these changes to improve their work.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect seems to be at least a 4 or 5.

It also asks about probabilities and hypothesis space. The explicitness here is high because it directly points out missing information and suggests specific actions like explaining grammar, probabilities, and inference. The concreteness is also good because it doesn't just say something is missing but asks for specifics on how to address it. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"grammar over kernels\" and mentions \"hypothesis space of kernels.\" It's pretty specific about which part of the paper is missing information. It doesn't just say \"details are missing\" but pinpoints the exact elements. So, this is fully grounded because it accurately identifies the sections and concepts that need clarification.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by stating that the details are missing and suggesting specific areas to look into. It provides some reasoning by asking about grammar, probabilities, and inference. However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't cite any external references or provide concrete examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear and directly points out specific issues and asks for detailed explanations.

The comment suggests adding a citation. Is this explicit? Yes, it's telling the authors to do something. Is it concrete? It says to add a citation, so authors know exactly what to do. So this should be Highly Actionable, which is 5.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment mentions Ren et al.'s work by name, which is specific. It's not just a general statement; it's pointing to a particular reference. So the grounding is strong, and it's specific about what needs to be addressed. That would be Fully Grounded and Specific, which is 5.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim by suggesting that Ren et al.'s work should be cited. It's supported by pointing out that previous works aren't cited, which is a logical reason. There's no external reference needed here, but the reasoning is clear. So this is Somewhat Verifiable, but since it's well-supported, maybe it's 4. Wait, the definitions say if it's thoroughly supported, it's 5. But the comment doesn't cite Ren et al., so maybe it's not fully verifiable. Hmm, perhaps it's 3 because it's somewhat justified but lacks a specific reference.\n\nWait, no, the comment does mention Ren et al., so it's specific. So maybe it's 4 because it's well-supported but could be clearer. Or maybe 5 because it's specific and the reasoning is logical. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The claim is to cite Ren et al., and the reasoning is that previous works aren't cited. That's logical and specific. So maybe it's 5.\n\nFinally, Helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a deficiency and suggesting a solution. It's clear and actionable. It helps the authors by directing them to add a citation, which is a specific improvement. So this should be Highly Helpful, which is 5.\n\nWait, but in the initial evaluation, I thought verifiability might be 3, but now I'm reconsidering. Since the comment cites a specific work, it's well-supported, so maybe 5. But the instruction said to score based on how well the claim is justified.

The action here is suggesting a clarification, which is explicit. But does it give a clear action? It tells the authors to clarify the title, but it doesn't specify how. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions clarifying the title but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper.

It's explicit because it directly asks about the correct notation. Then, it suggests defining t_R^m, which gives a clear action for the author. So, it's not just a question but also provides a specific fix. I think this is quite actionable because the author knows exactly what to check and what to define.

Similarly, lines 129-130 mention previous work but don't pin down the exact section. Lines 156-158 talk about computational efficiency but don't name the specific part of the paper. Lines 217-218 discuss samplers but don't reference a particular section. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't precisely identify the referenced part. The score here is **2: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because while they mention specific areas, they don't clearly specify what needs fixing in those areas.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, each claim in the review is supported by the need for citations. However, the justification is vague. The comments state that citations are needed but don't provide specific references or reasoning why those citations are necessary. This makes the verifiability somewhat lacking. The score is **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some support but not enough details.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out several areas where citations are needed but don't provide specific examples or references. This leaves the authors with a general suggestion without concrete guidance. The helpfulness is moderate because the feedback is clear but lacks depth. So, the score is **3: Somewhat Helpful** as it provides some direction but isn't comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the clarity and concreteness of the suggestions and how well they pinpoint specific parts of the paper.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3: Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2: Weakly Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3: Somewhat Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3: Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests adding a reference to a specific paper and proposes an evaluation on a standard dataset. The comment is explicit about the action, like \"It will be nice to include it in the tables\" and \"evaluate the performance... on the standard MS coco dataset.\" These are clear actions the authors can take. Additionally, the suggestions are concrete, such as including the ResNet-50 model and specifying the datasets. So, this seems highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do and how to apply the suggestions.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific papers and datasets. It refers to the ResNet-50 model and the MS COCO dataset, which are well-known and specific. The authors can easily identify where these are mentioned in the paper. Therefore, the grounding is strong because it clearly points to the relevant sections without ambiguity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests including a reference and evaluating performance, which are logical and common-sense actions. There's no claim made, just suggestions, so it's a factual statement. However, since it's a suggestion, it's not a claim, so verifiability isn't an issue here. But since there's no claim, it might not score high in verifiability. Wait, the comment doesn't contain a claim, so it's an X for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out specific areas for improvement\u2014adding a reference and evaluating performance on a standard dataset. These are clear and actionable suggestions. The authors would find this helpful as it directly addresses their work and provides clear directions for enhancement. So, it's highly helpful because it gives meaningful feedback that's easy to act upon.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect high actionability, strong grounding, no claim (so X for verifiability), and high helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests comparing the experimental section to methods like TFN or SchNet, which are coordinate-aware. The comment is explicit about the need for such a comparison but doesn't specify exactly how to implement it. It tells the authors what to do but doesn't give detailed steps or examples. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but doesn't provide specifics on how to apply it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific methods (TFN, SchNet) and clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is a comparison. It doesn't make any vague claims about the experimental section's unawareness. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the relevant methods and the issue. The specificity is good because it tells the authors exactly what to compare. Therefore, this would be a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests a comparison to established methods. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning beyond naming the methods. It's clear that comparing to these methods is a good idea, but there's no justification or evidence provided. So, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no supporting evidence or reasoning.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is clear about suggesting a relevant comparison but doesn't elaborate on why this comparison is beneficial or how it would improve the work. It's vague in terms of providing depth or context. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks the depth needed to be fully helpful. Therefore, it's a **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

The review says that ProtPainter provides an empirical confirmation estimation for binder design and suggests further optimization and validation are needed. The action here is \"further optimization and validation are required.\" That's pretty explicit, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The comment tells the authors exactly what needs to be done, which is to optimize and validate. So it's concrete because it's not just a suggestion but a clear action plan. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"binder design\" and talks about \"further optimization and validation.\" It's pretty specific about the part of the paper, so the grounding is strong. It's not just a vague comment about the paper but specifically points to a part, so grounding_specificity is 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment suggests further optimization and validation are needed. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement that something should be done. So there's no justification or examples given, which makes it unverifiable. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out that ProtPainter only provides an empirical estimation and suggests improvements. It gives a clear direction for the authors to take, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into detail about how to optimize or validate, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. So I'd rate this as 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 5, grounding_specificity: 5, verifiability: 1, helpfulness: 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It also suggests considering the stimulus duration and its effect. The comment is explicit in asking for clarification, which is a direct action. It doesn't just say \"clarify,\" it specifies what to look into, so that's explicit. Then, it goes on to suggest an experiment, which is a clear action. It also references external work, which provides a concrete example of how the model's time scale is handled. So, this is both explicit and concrete. I think this is highly actionable because it gives the authors exactly what to do and how to apply it.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment mentions Figure 7, which is specific. It also references Smirnakis et al. (Nature 1997), which is a well-known external work. The part about the stimulus duration is tied to the model's training details, so it's clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. The specificity is high because it's not just a vague suggestion but points to exact sections and external references. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim by suggesting an experiment and referencing external literature. The suggestion is clear and provides a logical reasoning by citing a similar study. The external reference is specific, so the claim is well-supported. Therefore, this is fully verifiable because it's backed by both logical reasoning and external evidence.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review point is asking for clarification on a specific part of the model training and suggests an experiment. It also references another study, which is helpful for the authors to understand the broader context. The suggestions are clear and actionable, providing the authors with meaningful feedback. It's not just a vague comment but actually guides them on what to do next.

So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions plotting a figure about accuracy decline over time. It's specific about the figure and the metric (accuracy), so the authors can pinpoint exactly where to focus.

It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify how to calculate it in practice. So, it's not fully actionable but gives a clear direction. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's explicit but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points to Figure 3 and 7 for excessive risk values and asks about their comparability across groups. It mentions the optimal solution \u03b8* and its relation to the loss function. The comment clearly references specific parts of the paper (the figures) and discusses a specific aspect (excessive risk values). It also implies the need to compare these values across groups, which is a specific issue. So, this is \"Fully Grounded and Specific\" because it accurately identifies the sections and clearly states what needs addressing.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that excessive risk values are positive in the figures and asks if they're comparable across groups.

It clearly states that they should include experiments with this model, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where to focus. There's no ambiguity here, so this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion, which is a claim.

It's explicit because it's directly telling the author to look for examples. But is it concrete? The author needs to know exactly where to look, which is a bit vague. So I think this is borderline actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper \"unreliable neighbors\" refers to. It's too vague, so the grounding is weak.

The action here is pointing out an expected result, but it's more of an implicit suggestion. The comment doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do, just states that the result is expected. So, it's not explicit. Since it's implicit, the authors might not know how to adjust their work. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about task-specific fine-tuning and generalizability but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section it's referring to. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly point to a specific part. Maybe a 2 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment makes a claim that the novelty is limited and that tighter CIs are expected.
