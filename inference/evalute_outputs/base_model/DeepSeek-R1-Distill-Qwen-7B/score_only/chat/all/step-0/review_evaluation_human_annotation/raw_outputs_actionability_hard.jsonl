It suggests this might introduce noise. The comment is explicit about the issue and provides a clear explanation of why it's a problem. It also gives a concrete example of how this could introduce noise. So, this is both explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review explicitly mentions the specific part of the paper being discussed, which is the HIERENC description. It also clearly explains what the issue is, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is high because it details the problem and how it could introduce noise.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that averaging all possible instantiations introduces noise. It provides a logical explanation and an example, so this is thoroughly supported. Therefore, it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear, points out a clear issue, and provides a specific example. It helps the authors understand a problem and how it might affect their work, which is very helpful.

But does it give explicit instructions on how to perform the study? The comment says \"I think an ablation study may be needed,\" which is a bit vague. It doesn't specify what to do, like what controls to change or how to measure the impact. So, it's explicit in suggesting the action but lacks detail on how to implement it. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions \"post-processing steps to filter out the 'false-positive' neurons\" and suggests an ablation study. It does reference specific parts of the paper, like the post-processing steps, so that's good. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is the importance of these steps.

It suggests the setting is only on extremely low-resource, which is a good point. It also points out that sentence classification is an easier task and that the augmentation method could be used on more NLP tasks. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does suggest improvements, like using more NLP tasks, but it's a bit vague. They don't specify exactly what changes to make, just that the method has potential. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to apply these suggestions. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about the low-resource setting and mentions sentence classification. They don't explicitly name the section of the paper, but they do point out that it's a limitation. So, they have some grounding because they're referring to specific issues in the paper. However, they don't clearly specify what needs fixing in that part, like which figures or tables. So, it's weak grounding because they could have been more precise.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer makes claims about the experiments being too limited to low-resource settings and that the method could be applied to more tasks. They don't provide external references or logical reasoning to back these claims up. It's just opinions and suggestions without much justification. So, it's not very verifiable. It's more of a borderline case because they do make claims, but without support.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides some good points about the limitations and potential applications. It does suggest areas for improvement, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are a bit vague, and the reviewer doesn't elaborate on how to implement them.

It also questions the term \"knowledge\" and provides alternatives. This is pretty explicit, so it's actionable. The reviewer gives clear directions on what to do, so I think this is a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions using a sequence of words and questions the term \"knowledge\". They don't explicitly name a section or figure, but they're pointing out a specific issue in the methodology. So, it's grounded because they're referring to a part of the paper, even if it's not a specific section. I'd rate this a 4 because it's clear but not the most precise.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer provides specific suggestions and examples, like constituent parse and AMR parsing. They also explain why the current approach is misleading. This is well-supported with examples and reasoning, so it's fully verifiable.

It also talks about the oracle GAP and the contradiction with the generalizability claim. The suggestions here are about understanding the gap and the generalizability issue. However, the review doesn't specify how to address these points. It just states the issues without providing clear actions or solutions. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of a commentary than a directive, which makes it borderline actionable because it does hint at areas for improvement but doesn't give detailed steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to nouns specifically, which is good because it's pointing out a particular part of the paper. It mentions TWSI's expected performance, which is a specific section, and the contradiction with the generalizability claim, which is a specific part of the methodology. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the sections being discussed. It's not just a vague comment but clearly addresses specific elements of the paper.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the clustering approach isn't generalizable because performance isn't uniform. It supports this with the mention of the oracle GAP being higher than most approaches and the specific section of the paper that contradicts the claim. This provides logical reasoning and references to specific parts of the paper, making it fairly verifiable. It's not fully verifiable because it doesn't cite external literature, but it's better than just a vague claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out specific issues and contradictions, which is helpful for the authors. It guides them to look into the noun performance and the generalizability of their approach. However, it doesn't offer detailed solutions or expand on these points, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. It's better than nothing but could be more comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat helpful because it points out specific issues, but it's not fully actionable or verifiable without more details.

It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a figure, table, or section. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is.

It tells the authors to improve their captions, which is an action. But does it give specific instructions on how to do that? The review doesn't specify whether they should add more details, use better terminology, or something else. So, it's an explicit action but lacks concrete details. That would make it **Borderline Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but doesn't tell exactly how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions \"figures\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or how to improve them. It just says \"explain the scramble network better.\" It doesn't reference a specific section or figure, so the grounding is weak. The authors might have to guess where to focus, which isn't helpful. So, this would be **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because it doesn't clearly identify the part of the paper being addressed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review doesn't contain any claims or opinions.

It says this choice isn't well motivated and asks why this dimension of difficulty is interesting. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue (using CIFAR images as backgrounds) and suggests that this choice isn't well motivated. However, the comment doesn't provide a clear action or specific steps the authors should take. It's more of a question than a suggestion, so it's not very actionable. Maybe the authors could be prompted to explain why this choice is made or how it affects their results, but the reviewer doesn't specify that. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it does mention the issue but doesn't give a clear direction on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to \"CIFAR images\" as the background. It's pretty specific about the type of images used. The reviewer is also asking a general question about why this particular difficulty is interesting, which might not be grounded because it's a broad question. However, the mention of CIFAR images is specific. So, I think this is **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it clearly identifies the part of the paper being discussed and asks a specific question about it.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the choice isn't well motivated. They're asking a question that could be supported by evidence, like citing previous studies on background complexity. However, the comment doesn't provide any justification or references. It's more of an opinion without backing, so it's **Unverifiable** because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a flaw in the methodology but isn't providing a clear solution or additional information.

It suggests adding periodicity to the spectral kernel to see if it captures results similarly to an explicitly compositional model. This is a clear question, so it's explicit. Then, it provides a specific action: trying adding periodicity to the spectral kernel. It also gives a concrete method for implementation, which is testing it. So, this is both explicit and concrete. Therefore, it's highly actionable, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review points to specific experiments (all except 1b) and mentions periodicity. It's clear which part of the paper it's referring to, so that's full grounding. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, which is adding periodicity to the spectral kernel. So, it's both grounded and specific, making it 5.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that adding periodicity would allow capturing all results at a similar level. The justification is the reasoning about the models' capabilities. It's logical and provides a clear explanation, so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review is asking a question and suggesting a specific experiment. It's helpful because it guides the authors to test a particular modification. While it's somewhat open-ended, it's still very actionable and constructive.

This is pretty grounded because they're pointing to a specific aspect of the dataset. They also clearly specify what's wrong, which is the dataset's size being insufficient. So this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that 44k dialogues isn't enough. They back this up by mentioning that LLMs are trained on trillions of tokens and that the dataset needs to be massive. This is supported by common knowledge about training data sizes, so it's thoroughly justified. That makes it fully verifiable, so a 5 here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a critical issue about dataset sufficiency, which is very helpful for the authors. They're providing a clear suggestion and backing it up with reasoning about typical training data sizes. This should be highly helpful, so a 5.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 5 because the review is clear, specific, well-supported, and directly helpful to the authors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

The review doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It just says some points are unclear. Without more details, the author can't pinpoint where the issues are. So, the grounding is weak because it's not specific. It's not fully grounded either since it's not just a guess but a general statement. But since it's not specific, I'd rate this a 2 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is a claim that writing needs improvement.

It's an explicit action because it directly tells the authors to consider alternative evaluation methods. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to implement this change or what other metrics to use. So, it's not fully actionable but still provides a clear direction. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is explicit but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The suggestion is quite general. It doesn't mention any specific part of the paper or provide examples. The authors can't pinpoint where the current metrics might fall short. So, this is \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific\" because it doesn't clearly identify the issue or reference any specific section.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting alternative metrics.

It's pointing out missing information. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The comment is directly stating what's missing, so that's explicit. Is it concrete? Yes, it mentions specific areas like upper limits, memory, and computational complexity. So it's both explicit and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions scalability bounds, memory, and computational complexity. It's not just a vague statement; it's pointing to specific parts of the paper. So the grounding is full because it accurately identifies the sections. The specificity is also good because it clearly states what's missing.

It's a claim that needs to be supported. However, the review doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's just a statement of what's missing without justification. So this is unverifiable.

So, this aspect would be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a judgment that abbreviations lack definition and cause confusion. It's a claim because it's an opinion or judgment about the paper. The justification provided is that 'AR' is explained but others aren't.

It's not asking the author to do something, just pointing out that the method isn't unsupervised. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The comment explains why it's not unsupervised by referring to the training set needing annotations. It gives a clear reason, so it's concrete.

However, the suggestion to \"give more explanations\" is vague. The reviewer also references another work (ref[15]) but doesn't specify how to apply it. So, while some actions are clear, others are vague. This seems to fall under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the explicit actions are there, but some details are missing.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer refers to Figure 5a and mentions energy consumption analysis similar to reference [15]. They don't explicitly state which part of the paper they're addressing, which makes it a bit unclear. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. However, they do mention specific elements like energy consumption, which adds some specificity. So, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer suggests using reference [15] but doesn't provide enough justification or examples. They also ask for more explanations, which is a good suggestion but lacks supporting evidence. This makes the claim somewhat verifiable but not fully. So, it's \"Somewhat Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides several suggestions, which is helpful. However, some of the suggestions are vague, like asking for more explanations without specifics. The reference to another work is good but not detailed.

It also asks about redundancy and interference in the discretization process. The action here is pointing out ambiguity and unclear explanations, which is explicit. However, the suggestion to ask about redundancy and interference is a bit vague. It doesn't tell the author exactly what to do next, just asks a question. So, it's explicit but not very detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the authors assumed the spectrum of a kernel is sub-gaussian, which is fine because Gaussian kernels are in that class. However, Matern kernels, which are more commonly used, have spectra that decay polynomially, so the authors' results might be restrictive. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the comment is pointing out a limitation, but it's more of an observation rather than a direct action. The authors might need to consider alternative kernels or adjust their analysis. So, it's not entirely explicit because it's more of an implication rather than a direct suggestion. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest a limitation but doesn't explicitly tell them how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about Matern kernels and their polynomial decay. It specifically mentions that these kernels aren't included because their spectrum decays polynomially. This clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, like a specific section or figure if mentioned. It also specifies what's wrong with the current kernels. So, this has strong grounding because it accurately points to the issue without needing further clarification. I'd give this a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** score.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment states that Matern kernels have polynomial decay. This is a claim because it's making a judgment about the kernels' properties. The justification is that they decay polynomially, which is a well-known characteristic. So, the claim is supported by common knowledge, making it **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation that the authors might not have considered. It's clear and provides a specific area for improvement. While it doesn't suggest a fix, it does highlight a potential area where the authors can enhance their work. This is helpful because it guides them to think about alternative kernels or methods. So, I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful** because it's clear and prompts further action, though it could be expanded for more detailed guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 5\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests that most findings have been reported before. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the review provides explicit and clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review does suggest that the paper's contributions are not novel, which is an explicit action. However, it doesn't specify exactly what changes the authors should make, like proposing a more complex model or providing new evidence. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details on how to implement the changes. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review references specific works (NN-based clustering algorithms) and mentions the findings are in Sec 5. It accurately points out where the issues are, so the grounding is strong. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, which is Sec 5. Additionally, it explains why the findings are not novel, which adds specificity. Therefore, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that the findings are not novel and that the settings are too simplified. It references external work, which is a form of external reference. However, the justification is a bit vague, as it doesn't provide detailed reasoning or examples. It mentions previous works but doesn't cite specific studies or data to support the claim. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out that the paper's findings are not novel and suggests that the settings are too simplified.

Hmm, since it's an implicit suggestion, I think 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions inverse triples and other models but doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. They're talking about other embedding models, which is a general statement. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or figure. Maybe a 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that introducing inverse triples in other models could be beneficial. They're suggesting a change but don't provide evidence or reasoning. It's a claim without support, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment suggests a possible improvement but doesn't explain why or how it would help. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable advice. So, it's barely helpful. Maybe a 2.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For actionability, it's an implicit suggestion, so 3 makes sense. Grounding is weak because it's general, so 2. Verifiability is low because no justification, so 1. Helpfulness is low because it's vague, so 2. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the number of parameters doesn't change, but if kernel dimensions stay the same, depth increases, leading to more parameters. It also suggests that efficiency could be improved because FLOPs are quadratic on activation size. However, it doesn't specify how to implement this. So, the action is implicit because the reviewer is pointing out an issue but not giving explicit steps on how to fix it. Therefore, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it does hint at a solution but doesn't detail it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about the S2D structure, kernel height/width, and activation side length. They mention FLOPs and parameters but don't explicitly name the section or part of the paper they're referring to. It's a bit vague, so they aren't fully pinpointing the issue. This means the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the exact part of the paper being discussed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim about why the number of parameters doesn't change when kernel size remains the same. They provide some reasoning about FLOPs being quadratic on activation size, which is logical. However, they don't cite external references or specific examples, so it's somewhat justified but lacks depth. This would be \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because there's some support but not enough to be fully convincing.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential improvement in efficiency but doesn't provide detailed actionable steps. It's clear that more parameters could be an issue, but without specific guidance on how to adjust them, the helpfulness is limited. It's not completely unhelpful, but it's not fully detailed either.

I think this is an explicit statement, so it's clear what the issue is. But does it give any specific actions? It suggests the authors should consider more games and baselines, which is a bit vague.

It's not giving a direct action or suggestion. It's more of an observation rather than a directive. So, it's not actionable because the author isn't told what to do; they're just informed that they don't understand it. Therefore, this is borderline actionable because it hints at a problem but doesn't specify how to fix it.\n\n**Grounding Specificity:** The comment refers to Figure 5 but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a general statement about the figure, so the grounding is weak. The author isn't told exactly where the issue is, just that they don't understand it.

For the figures, it suggests making them larger. For equation 5, it asks how it follows from 4. For \u03b8, it wants an explanation. For S* and S~, it points out the cyclic definition. These are all clear and direct actions the authors can take. So, each part is explicit and concrete. That should be a high score on actionability, probably 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific parts of the paper: figures, equations, and parameters. It refers to equation 5, \u03b8^{t+1/2}, and S* and S~.

So, grounding_specificity should be 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains claims. It's suggesting improvements, which are opinions, and it's making judgments about clarity and proper definition. Now, for each claim, it's asking for explanations or pointing out issues. For example, asking how equation 5 follows from 4 is a claim that needs justification. Similarly, questioning the definition of \u03b8^{t+1/2} is a claim that could be supported by references or logical reasoning. The parts about S* and S~ being important but not defined are also claims that could be better justified with more context or references.

It's not just vague; it's asking for explanations that could be provided. So, verifiability should be 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review provides several specific points, each suggesting clear actions. It's not just vague comments; it's actionable. The suggestions are detailed enough that the authors can understand what needs to be done. For example, explaining how equation 5 follows from 4 would help the authors check their work or understand the flow. Similarly, pointing out the cyclic definition of S~ gives a clear direction for improvement. The review is comprehensive and directly addresses multiple issues, making it highly helpful. So, helpfulness should be 5.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is highly actionable, well-grounded, verifiable, and helpful. So, all scores are 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests that this isn't a VAD because it's just discarding zero bins and causing division by zero. The reviewer is pointing out a potential misunderstanding of VAD. The comment is explicit about the issue and provides a clear explanation, so it's actionable. It tells the author to reconsider their approach, which is helpful. I think this is **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's clear but maybe doesn't specify exactly how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions VAD, which is a specific algorithm, and points out the issue with the method. They also explain why it's not a proper VAD, which is specific to the paper's context. So the grounding is solid because it clearly references the section and explains the problem. This should be **4: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the author's method isn't a VAD. They back this up by explaining what VAD typically does and why the author's approach is flawed. This is logical and supported by common knowledge, so it's **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a clear issue and suggests improvements, which is directly helpful for the author.

Is this an explicit action? Yes, it's telling the authors to consider using ImageNet. But is it concrete? It doesn't specify how to apply this change, like suggesting a particular analysis or modification. So it's explicit but not concrete. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The comment mentions ImageNet, which is a specific dataset. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, so that's full grounding. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the results section. So this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that ImageNet results would be more convincing. It's supported by common knowledge that using established datasets like ImageNet can validate results. So it's thoroughly justified with common knowledge, making it **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment is clear and suggests a specific improvement. It provides a meaningful feedback point for the authors to consider their results. It's actionable and well-supported, so it's **5: Highly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects.

It provides a specific example about handling corrupted modalities. This is explicit and gives a clear action, so it's actionable. The action is also concrete because it specifies how to improve robustness. So, this should be a high score.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to the connection between complementary and robustness but doesn't mention specific sections or tables. It's a bit vague, so grounding is weak. However, it does identify the issue clearly, so it's not completely weak either.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the contribution being insufficient and suggests specific solutions. It provides some reasoning, like the conclusion being intuitive, but it's not fully supported by external references or clear examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

It suggests the method uses self-attention like transformers but doesn't explain the connection to the theoretical analysis. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a missing link but isn't giving a direct action like suggesting a modification. So, it's implicit. How concrete is the action? The reviewer isn't providing specific steps or details on how the method improves generalization. It's vague. So, this is **Borderline Actionable** because it hints at an issue but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer refers to the authors' PAC-Bayesian bound and the self-attention mechanism. They mention the transductive setting and distant nodes but don't specify exactly which part of the paper or method is being discussed. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pinpointing the exact section or issue. The specificity about what needs improvement is also lacking. Therefore, this is **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the proposed method doesn't connect the theory well and that it's just using self-attention. They're suggesting that the method doesn't enhance generalization for distant nodes. To verify this, they need to provide evidence or reasoning. However, the review doesn't offer specific references or logical justification.

It says the heads are active at S2 but not the primary focus. The comment is explicit about the correction, so that's good. It also provides a clear direction for the authors to check their model against the literature, which is a concrete action. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions a specific section of the paper (Section 3) and clearly states what's wrong with the authors' claim. It doesn't just refer to the section but goes into detail about the primary focus. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the relevant part of the paper, and the specificity is high as it explains why the heads don't primarily attend to S2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment references an external source (Wang et al., 2023) and explains why the authors' statement is incorrect. It provides logical reasoning by explaining that the heads are active but not primary. This is well-supported, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific error in the authors' analysis. It's clear, provides a correction, and guides the authors on where to look for more information.

It doesn't give an explicit action or how to fix it. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to improve the draft based on this comment. I think this is borderline actionable because it does point out an issue, but it's vague.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to the \"eta_ri term\" and mentions the \"non-central chi-squared distribution.\" It's specific about the part of the paper being discussed, so that's good grounding. It clearly identifies the issue without needing more context. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's making a judgment about why the term is a non-central chi-squared distribution. It needs justification, but the review doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning. So, it's not fully verifiable. It's more like somewhat verifiable because it's a claim, but without support, it's borderline.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a problem but doesn't suggest a solution.

It suggests that inference speed improvement is more interesting than FLOPs reduction. The action here is clear: compare inference speed. It's explicit, so that's good. Then, it provides concrete details on what to compare, which is specific. So, this should be highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to do and how to apply it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review specifically mentions comparing inference speed between the proposed network and prior work. It's not just a general statement; it's pointing out a specific part of the paper. So, the grounding is full because it accurately identifies the section being addressed. Additionally, it's clear what needs to be addressed, so specificity is also high. Therefore, this review is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that inference speed improvement is more interesting than FLOPs reduction.

It's just a suggestion without supporting reasoning or references, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review offers a suggestion but doesn't elaborate on why it's beneficial or how it helps the authors improve.

It's explicit because it directly tells the authors where to add content. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to implement this, like whether it should be a section, appendix, or something else. So, it's not fully actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions an appendix but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's related to. It's not clear if it's for a specific section or a general reference. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint the exact area.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion without any supporting evidence or references. It's not a claim that needs justification, so it's unclear if this is a claim or just a suggestion. Since it's more of a suggestion, it doesn't require verifiability, so it's not applicable here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and provides a specific area for improvement. It's actionable in the sense that it tells the authors where to add content, even though it's vague on the specifics.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the explicit methods perform better than implicit ones and points out that the pseudo-code is missing. It suggests that the authors should provide the pseudo-code. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The comment is clear about the recommendation, so that's explicit. But does it give a clear action? It says to provide the pseudo-code, which is a direct action. So, it's explicit and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review talks about explicit vs. implicit methods and mentions the missing pseudo-code. It doesn't specify which part of the paper is being addressed beyond that. The mention of the pseudo-code is general, not pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that explicit methods perform better and recommends providing the pseudo-code. It doesn't give any justification or references for why explicit methods are better. It just states the claim without supporting evidence. So, this is unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out a weakness (missing pseudo-code) and suggests an improvement. It's clear and provides a specific area for the authors to focus on. While it doesn't go into detail about why the pseudo-code is missing or how to provide it, it's still helpful because it guides the authors to take an action. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests looking at a related study and checking the figures. The comment is explicit about the need to check the figures, so that's a clear action. It also mentions specific papers, which gives a direct reference. Since it tells the authors exactly what to do, it's explicit and concrete. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific papers and refers to figures by name. It's not just a general statement; it's pointing to particular sections of the literature. This means the authors can pinpoint where to look, so it's fully grounded. Additionally, it explains why checking the figures is important, which adds specificity. Therefore, this is both grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review cites two external papers. These are well-known sources, and the suggestions are based on established research. The references are clear and provide a solid foundation for the claims made. So, the verifiability is high because the claims are well-supported by external evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers specific suggestions about related work and the importance of checking figures. It's not just a criticism but also provides constructive alternatives. The references are credible, and the advice is actionable. This makes the review highly helpful as it guides the authors in improving their work.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores highly. The review is explicit and concrete, grounded and specific, well-supported, and very helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that experimental validation isn't convincing because only shallow networks (2 or 3 layers) are considered. It also points out that the optimization strategy, including the grid search for hyperparameters, isn't described. Additionally, the positioning relative to related work is limited, mentioning layer redundancy but not how it compares to existing methods.\n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review does suggest looking into deeper networks and mentions a specific paper for the optimization strategy, which is helpful. However, it's a bit vague about how exactly to implement these changes. So, it's not fully actionable because some parts are still unclear.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"Experimental validation are not convincing\" which is a bit vague. It mentions \"shallow networks\" but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper they're referring to. The hyperparameter grid search isn't detailed, and the related work section's limitations are only partially addressed. So, the grounding isn't fully specific because the exact sections or aspects aren't clearly identified.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review contains a claim that experimental validation isn't convincing and lists specific issues. It also references a specific paper, which adds verifiability. However, the justification for why deeper networks aren't considered is a bit vague. The reference is provided, but the reasoning behind the recommendation isn't fully explained. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully robust.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out several issues, provides references, and suggests areas for improvement. It does give the authors direction on where to look for more information, which is helpful. However, some of the suggestions are quite broad, and the depth of the feedback could be improved. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the highest level.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its pros and cons.

This is a specific action the authors should take, which is to test the model on other tasks. The comment is explicit about the action, so it's not implicit. It also provides clear guidance on what to do, making it concrete. So, this should be a high actionable score, probably 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Task 1 specifically, which means it's fully grounded because it clearly identifies the part of the paper (the bAbI tasks). It doesn't just refer to the dataset but specifies which task, so this is well-grounded and specific. Therefore, the grounding_specificity score should be 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the model was only tested on one task. It doesn't provide evidence or references, so it's not verifiable.

The author may improve it and give more illustrations and examples.\" The first thing I notice is that it points out a problem in a specific section, which is good. But then it suggests improvements by giving more examples. The action here is to improve and give more illustrations. Is this explicit or implicit? It seems like the reviewer is making a suggestion but not exactly stating how to do it. They mention \"give more illustrations and examples,\" which is a clear action, but they don't specify how to implement it, like whether to add more figures, tables, or detailed paragraphs. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for improvement but vague on the exact steps. That would make it somewhat actionable because the reviewer knows what needs to be done, but it's not fully explicit.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"Sec. 3.2\" which is specific. So the reviewer is accurately pinpointing a section, which is full grounding. Then, the suggestion is to give more illustrations and examples. Since it's about a specific section, the specificity is clear. The reviewer is not just talking about the paper in general but about a particular part, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review contains a claim that the section is hard to follow and suggests improvements. The claim is that the author should improve by adding more illustrations and examples. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the suggestion is a recommendation, not a fact. It's more of a suggestion than a claim that needs evidence. So, I think this falls under \"X: No Claim\" because it's not making a judgment or a claim that requires verification. It's more of a directive.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem in a specific section and suggests improvements. The suggestion is clear and actionable, telling the author what needs to be done. It's not vague; it's specific about the area and the type of improvement.

But it points out that choosing convex or concave, or increasing/decreasing is a hyperparameter that needs tuning. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is directly pointing out the hyperparameter aspect, so that's explicit. Is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly which choices are hyperparameters and need tuning. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific types of constraints like convex or concave, and increasing or decreasing.

It suggests the paragraph provides little value. Is this explicit? Yes, it mentions DNNs and states it's not central. But is it concrete? It tells the authors to focus on other parts but doesn't specify how. So it's explicit but vague. I think this would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions DNNs and says it's not central. It accurately points out the paragraph's lack of relevance. So it's fully grounded because it correctly identifies the section. But it's specific in pointing out the absence of focus. So this should be a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim that the DNN intro is not central. It doesn't provide evidence or reasoning, so it's unverifiable. It's just a statement without justification. So this would be a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review clearly points out the issue and suggests improvement. It's helpful because it guides the authors to focus on other parts. It's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed.

Yes, because they're specifying that the comparison should be more comprehensive, not just zero-shot. So, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about Pix3D and zero-shot models. They clearly mention the specific models and the type of comparison. So, they're fully grounding the specific part of the paper being discussed. They also specify what's wrong with the current comparison. That's a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the comparison is unfair. They support this by stating that zero-shot models are \"even more unfair.\" They're using common knowledge about the limitations of zero-shot models, which is a form of external reference. So, this is fully verifiable, scoring a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer provides clear feedback about the unfair comparison and suggests a better approach. This is actionable and constructive, so it's highly helpful.

However, it doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs improvement. It's a general question, so the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint the exact section or issue being addressed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about computational efficiency but isn't providing any justification or references. It's a subjective opinion without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking a question about computational aspects but doesn't offer any suggestions or solutions. It doesn't provide meaningful feedback to the authors, so it's not helpful at all.\n\nPutting it all together, the review point is borderline actionable, weakly grounded, unverifiable, and not helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}

It also notes that many papers have developed similar tasks. The comment suggests improvements but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's vague about the actions the authors should take, like whether they need to add baselines or compare against codesearch. So, it's not explicit, and the actions are not concrete. Therefore, it's borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about functionality similarity, which is a broad area. It mentions that many papers have done similar tasks but doesn't pin down exactly which part of the paper or what specific issue needs addressing. The grounding is weak because it's too vague and doesn't clearly identify the referenced part or issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests improvements but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification. It doesn't cite any external references or logical reasoning to back up why the suggestions are valid. So, it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out important areas for improvement but lacks clarity and depth. It doesn't provide specific actionable steps or detailed suggestions. This makes it somewhat helpful but not fully so.

The comment is explicit about pointing out the mistake, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify how to fix it. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on the correction. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it tells them there's a problem but doesn't tell them how to address it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions the abstract specifically, which is a clear reference. It also points out that the authors clarified elsewhere, so it's not just a vague statement. This means the comment is both grounded (it refers to a specific part) and specific (it explains what's wrong). So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the abstract's claim is incorrect. It references the authors' clarification in the text, which is a form of justification. This provides enough support, so it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because it's not perfect but better than just a claim without backing.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out an error in the abstract and suggests the authors check their clarification. It's clear and provides a specific improvement area. However, it doesn't offer a solution, so it's helpful but not the most comprehensive.

Is this explicit or implicit? Well, it's just a question, so the authors would need to infer what to do. That makes it implicit. Now, is it concrete? The authors might not know exactly how to improve the section without more guidance. So, it's not very concrete. It's more of a general question, so I'd rate this as 2: Borderline Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is pointing out a specific section, so the authors can identify it. That's full grounding. But then, it's just asking about the intent, which is a general question. So, they don't specify what needs to be addressed. That makes it under-specific. So, this would be 4: Fully Grounded and Under-Specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a question, not a claim. So, it doesn't require evidence. It's more of a request for clarification, which is a normal statement. Therefore, it's not verifiable, so it's an X.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

It mentions the paper goes too deep into technical details without explaining the overall approach. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They suggest clarifying parts but don't provide clear steps. So, it's not explicit. It's more of a suggestion without concrete actions, so it's not actionable. Maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the approach's interaction between objects and verbs but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It's vague about the exact section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. Maybe a 2 or 3 here.\n\n**Verifiability**: The reviewer is making a judgment that the paper lacks clarity on a key point. They're suggesting improvements but not providing evidence or references.

However, the suggestion about adding discourse relations is vague\u2014how exactly should they be included? There's no detailed guidance on that. So, it's not fully actionable because the method isn't clearly defined. I think this falls under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does mention an action but doesn't provide specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about the GPT baseline and few-shot approaches but doesn't specify which part of the paper these issues pertain to. It's unclear whether it's referring to the methodology, results, or something else. Also, when suggesting adding discourse relations, it's vague about which part that would affect.

It seems like it's an explicit statement because it directly mentions the issue. But is it concrete? The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a specific action. They might want the author to explain where the numbers are or how to find them. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"numbers of parameters\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where to look. It's not pointing to a specific section or table.

It suggests that statements like \"our performance is at least two standard deviations better\" don't make sense. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the review is pointing out a limitation in the methodology but isn't suggesting any specific changes. It's more of a critique without actionable steps. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit comment, which might be considered somewhat actionable but not fully.

It suggests this could break acceleration techniques like quantization and sparsification. \n\nFor actionability, it's about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. The review explicitly states the issue (not mentioning global Q values) and suggests a problem with acceleration techniques. However, it doesn't provide concrete steps on what the authors should do next. They might need to look into global Q values or compare with average gradients. So, it's explicit but lacks specific guidance on how to implement the fix.

It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a general statement about the existence of multiple entities. It doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That gives it a score of 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem but doesn't offer any specific suggestions or solutions. It's just stating that the issue exists without providing actionable steps. So, it's not helpful at all. The helpfulness score is 1.\n\nPutting it all together, all four aspects are scored 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}

It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next, like suggesting specific changes or improvements. It's more of a general question, so it's not providing actionable steps. Therefore, it's not highly actionable or even somewhat actionable. It might be borderline because it's asking a question, but without a clear direction, it's probably unactionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review point mentions prior art but doesn't specify which part of the paper or which specific prior work is being compared to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint exactly where the comparison is needed, so it's not fully grounded. It might be weakly grounded because it's referring to prior art in general, but without specifics, it's not fully grounded.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review point is making a judgment about comparing with prior art, which is a claim. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating that the method should be compared with prior work, but there's no supporting evidence or logical reasoning. So, it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is asking about the comparison with prior art, which is a valid concern. However, it's a general question without specific suggestions or justifications. It doesn't provide enough guidance for the authors to improve their work.

It says the CLT guarantees Gaussianity in a non-asymptotic regime and applies to any finite linear combination. The reviewer explains that this is incorrect. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out specific errors in the authors' claim. It's clear what the mistake is, so the authors can directly address it.

It says that automatic scores aren't effective and human evaluation is too costly. It also points out that FFAEVAL and similar systems, like Chatbot Arena, are used for comparing dialogue systems but can't evaluate a single system's fluency. The reviewer suggests that these arena-based systems won't solve the problems with current score-based systems.\n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a limitation, but it's more of a critique rather than a clear action. They're suggesting that these systems aren't suitable, but they don't provide a specific action or improvement. So, it's not explicit or direct. It's more of an opinion without a clear solution. Therefore, I think it's borderline actionable because it's vague on how to apply the suggestion.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer talks about the abstract section and mentions that the proposed method isn't relevant to the authors' motivations. They also compare arena-based systems to score-based ones. But does this clearly identify which part of the paper they're referring to? They mention the abstract section but don't specify exactly which part or how it's relevant.

They mention it's in the abstract, but it's not fully grounded since they don't explain why it's a problem or how it affects the paper.\n\nMoving on to Verifiability. The reviewer makes several claims here. They claim that automatic scores aren't effective, which is a subjective judgment. They also claim that human evaluation is costly, which is a judgment based on their opinion. Additionally, they claim that arena-based systems can't solve the problems with score-based systems, which is another judgment. Now, are these claims verifiable? The first two are opinions, so they don't require evidence. The third is a general statement about the limitations of arena-based systems, which could be supported by common knowledge about evaluation methods. However, the claim that they can't solve the problems is a bit vague and lacks specific references or examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a basis for the claim, but it's not fully supported.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer's comments are critical about the proposed method and suggest that existing evaluation systems aren't suitable. They provide some opinions and judgments but don't offer concrete suggestions or solutions. They don't elaborate on why automatic scores are ineffective or how human evaluation can be improved.

The comment suggests using RoBERTa-base instead of BERT, which is an explicit action. However, it doesn't provide concrete details on how to implement this change, like specific modifications or steps. So it's explicit but vague.

It mentions showing how to use the method, which is a clear action. But it doesn't specify how to do that. So, it's explicit in stating the action but vague on the details. That would fall under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it's explicit but lacks concrete steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about \"how to use the proposed method\" and \"without severely damaging the performance.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be shown. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or element. It's more general, hence \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion to show a method but doesn't provide any justification or references.

It suggests that the authors should avoid this phrasing. That's an explicit action, so it's clear what needs to be done. It's not just a suggestion; it's a direct instruction. So, this is actionable. It's not vague or missing details. So, I think this is highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions a specific line where \"to meet\" is used. It's not just a general comment but points to a particular part of the paper. So, the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is. That's full grounding because it's specific and clear. There's no weakness in grounding here, so it's probably a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that using \"to meet\" is difficult to understand. It's a subjective judgment. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is stating their opinion, but there's no external reference or logical reasoning provided. They just say it's difficult without backing it up. So, it's a claim without support, making it unverifiable. Maybe a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a specific issue and suggests improvement. It's clear and directly actionable. The authors can easily understand what needs to be changed. So, this is highly helpful. It's not just a vague comment; it's specific and useful. So, a 5.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, maybe it's a bit tricky. If the reviewer had provided examples or references, it would be better. But since they didn't, it's unverifiable.

The action here is suggesting a specific change in how the figure should be connected. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what needs to be done. Then, it's concrete because it specifies the exact parts of the figure that should be connected and which should not. So, this is highly actionable. I think it should be a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 2 and specifically talks about connecting certain images. It accurately refers to the figure and the specific images without making any educated guesses. So, the grounding is full because it clearly points to the figure and the parts within it. The specificity is also high because it explains exactly which connections are needed. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about which connections are appropriate. It's not just stating a fact; it's giving an opinion on how the figure should be interpreted. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's a subjective opinion without supporting evidence. So, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable if we consider the judgment, but without justification, it's unclear.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment suggests a specific change but doesn't explain why that change is necessary or how it improves the figure. It's clear that the authors need to connect these images, but there's no reasoning provided. Without justification, the helpfulness is limited. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth.

The action here is pointing out a discrepancy between two figures. However, it doesn't specify what needs to be done next. The reviewer doesn't suggest any changes or improvements, just points out the difference. So, this is an explicit action but lacks detail on how to fix it.

It doesn't make general comments, just points to the figures, so it's **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the two figures should be consistent. They're suggesting a change in the model structure. This is a claim because it's an opinion or judgment about the paper's methodology. The justification is that having a shared encoder-decoder might not be standard, so it's supported by common knowledge or practices in the field.

For example, it says \"improve the experiments\" but doesn't specify how, like adding more architectures or including recent methods.

The review mentions \"teacher architectures\" and \"methods proposed before 2019\" and refers to a table. It's pretty specific about which parts of the paper are problematic. It doesn't just say \"the paper is bad,\" but points to exact sections. So, the grounding is solid because it clearly identifies the sections being discussed. Therefore, grounding specificity should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the review claims that the experiments are insufficient and that most methods are old.
