But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It says these abbreviations aren't defined, but it doesn't specify how the authors should address this. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but lacks concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know the problem, but they don't know how to fix it. So, I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about LLH, OOD, and ECE without specifying which part of the paper these metrics relate to. It's not pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. They know there's a problem with these abbreviations but not where exactly. Therefore, this is weakly grounded and not specific, so a score of 2.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment mentions that these abbreviations aren't defined and that OOD and ECE were explicitly defined elsewhere. It's pointing out that LLH isn't defined, but it's not clear why this is a problem or how it affects the paper. It references another work but doesn't provide enough justification.

It asks the authors to justify the stability and explain what happens with more layers. The comment is explicit about the issue and suggests the authors provide justification, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement this justification, like with examples or references. So, it's explicit but not very detailed.

It's not bad, and the author is fine with derivatives if they work. Hmm, so the comment is pointing out that the approach is derivative. Is that an explicit action? Well, it's making a statement about the approach, but it's not giving a specific action the author should take. It's more of a general comment.

To support this, they need to provide evidence or reasoning. However, the review doesn't offer any justification or references. It's just a statement without backing, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a significant gap in the paper by not comparing to state-of-the-art methods. This is clear and actionable for the authors, suggesting they need to include such comparisons.

Is this explicit? Yes, it's directly pointing out an issue. But is it concrete? It mentions the cyclical learning rate and the perturbation, so it does give a specific action. So I think this is **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's explicit but maybe lacks some detail on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the first part of the paper, which is about explaining why FGE work. It mentions the cyclical learning rate and the weight perturbation. So the grounding is explicit because it's referring to a specific section. It's also specific because it's talking about what's wrong with that part. So this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the first part doesn't explain well why FGE work. It's suggesting that the cyclical learning rate's perturbation doesn't guarantee following the curve.

So, this should be **4: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points out the issue without needing more details.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that specifying certain elements complicates the process and restricts usability. Is this a claim? Yes, it's making a judgment about the system's practical usability. Is there supporting evidence? It mentions the complexity and the need for specific inputs, which are logical reasons. So, this should be **4: Mostly Verifiable** because it's well-supported but maybe lacks some references or examples.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out practical limitations but doesn't offer specific solutions or how to improve the system. It's pointing out a problem but not how to fix it. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully constructive. Therefore, this should be **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does inform the authors of issues but doesn't provide actionable steps.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 4\n- Grounding Specificity: 4\n- Verifiability: 4\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It also mentions not contrasting with traditional methods. For actionability, I'm looking for explicit actions or clear suggestions. The comment points out a lack of significance and suggests a comparison, but it's vague on how to do that. So it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to contrast the methods. Maybe it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the technique being novel and contributions not being significant. It doesn't specify which part of the paper is lacking. It's too general, so the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. Also, it doesn't mention specific sections or examples, so it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the contributions aren't significant and suggesting a comparison. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back these claims. So it's not verifiable because there's no justification or support given. It's more of an opinion without backing.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review does point out some issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful.

It cites two papers. Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. The comment explicitly states the need for a discussion, which is clear. However, it doesn't specify what changes should be made, like suggesting alternative methods or providing guidelines. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** (3).\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific papers, which is a good sign. It's not just a general statement but points to external work. It also clearly states the trade-off between dataset size and computation time, which helps pinpoint the issue. So, it's **Fully Grounded and Specific** (5).\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review includes references to two papers, which adds credibility. It explains the trade-off between accuracy and computation time, which is logical reasoning. So, it's well-supported and **Fully Verifiable** (5).\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment suggests a discussion and cites relevant papers, which is helpful.

The review says the authors didn't explain why keeping representations in the same hidden space is better and hasn't experimentally verified it. It's explicit about the issue but doesn't give concrete steps on how to fix it. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. Maybe they need more guidance on why this is important or how to verify it.

The review mentions the same hidden space but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's vague about the exact section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded since it's not clearly pointing to a specific part.\n\nFor verifiability, the review suggests an experiment hasn't been done but doesn't provide any justification or references. It's a claim that an experiment should be done, but there's no support or examples given. So, it's borderline because it's a claim without enough backing, making it unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem and suggests an improvement but doesn't elaborate on why it's important or how to proceed. It's vague and lacks depth, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

It points out that this doesn't offer a significant advancement. The comment suggests that the approach is not novel enough. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a lack of novelty but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done. So, it's implicit because the reviewer is implying that the method isn't novel, but they don't tell the authors how to make it more novel. Therefore, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know what changes to make. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions Karwande et al. (2022) and Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015). It's clear which sections of the paper are being referenced\u2014related work and the methods section. The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue in these areas. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the relevant sections. The specificity is also good because it clearly states what's lacking: the lack of significant novelty. So, this would be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is making a claim that the approach doesn't offer significant advancement. The reviewer is suggesting that this is a judgment based on their understanding of the existing literature. However, they don't provide external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's a subjective opinion without strong justification. So, this is borderline verifiable, which would be a 2.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review points out a valid concern about lack of novelty but doesn't provide specific actionable steps or examples of how to improve the method.

It suggests looking at S5 as an example. This is explicit, so it's clear what the reviewer is pointing out. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to modify their approach. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because the action is clear, but the implementation isn't detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to SSM-based approaches and specifically mentions S5. It's clear which part of the paper is being discussed, so the grounding is strong. It also explains how S5 works, which helps the authors understand why their approach is problematic. So, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately identifies the section and explains the issue clearly.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that S5 avoids keeping \u0394t fixed by using a parallel scan.

It mentions that it's more standard to talk about causal graphs, not label inference. It also points out that definition 4 is hard to read because the graph isn't specified. \n\nHmm, so the review is suggesting changes to how the underlying mechanism is described. It's giving a specific action by pointing out inaccuracies and suggesting a better terminology. That seems explicit. Now, is the action clear? The reviewer is recommending using causal graphs instead of label inference, which is a specific action. They also mention that definition 4 is unclear, which is a concrete action. So, this is explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable.

It's explicit about the action, which is moving the results. But it doesn't specify how to do that, like suggesting a change in the table or providing a link. So it's explicit but lacks detail.

It mentions that human evaluations are more important. Now, is this an explicit action? It's more of a statement about the limitations of metrics and the importance of human judgment. It doesn't directly tell the authors what to do or how to improve. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an observation, so I think it's not actionable.

It doesn't specify which part of the paper or results it's referring to. It's a general statement, so the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the issue. It's not fully grounded. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that human evaluations are more important. It's a claim that human evaluations are more important, but does it provide any justification? It doesn't cite any external references or logical reasoning. It's just a statement without support.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the CT experiment has only one subject in the test set, which is a clear issue. It suggests discussing limitations, like theoretical assumptions and implementation considerations. It also asks about training time when comparing ODER with other methods. The comment is explicit about the issue and provides specific areas for improvement, so that's actionable. It doesn't seem vague or unclear, so I think it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review points out a specific limitation in the test set size, which is directly referencing the paper's Section 6. It also suggests discussing other aspects like assumptions and training time, which are specific parts of the work. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the relevant sections and provides clear suggestions.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment makes a claim by suggesting improvements and asking for comparisons. It provides logical reasoning, like discussing overfitting and the need for more subjects. It also references external knowledge about model limitations and training times. The evidence is solid, so this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is very helpful because it directly addresses specific weaknesses, suggests meaningful improvements, and provides clear questions. It's comprehensive and guides the authors effectively, so it's highly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 5 because they all meet the highest criteria in each category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

The review says that between lines 216 and 217, the bound on the 2-Wasserstein is O(\u03b5\u00b2), but that's the bound on the squared 2-Wasserstein. The action here is pointing out a mistake in the statement. It's explicit because it clearly states the issue. It's also concrete because it specifies that the bound is on the squared Wasserstein, not the Wasserstein itself. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions a specific part of the paper between lines 216 and 217. It's not just a general statement; it's pointing to a particular location. So the grounding is full because it accurately identifies the section being addressed. The specificity is also high because it clearly explains what's wrong\u2014the bound is on the squared Wasserstein. So this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the bound is on the squared Wasserstein. It's supported by the fact that the reviewer knows the correct statement and can explain why the original statement was incorrect. So this is fully verifiable because it's backed by logical reasoning and common knowledge in the field.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

It's a good question, but does it give clear instructions on what the authors should do next? It mentions specific methods like IEConv, CDConv, etc., but it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to improve their model. So, it's not explicit enough. It's more of a question than a directive, so I think it's borderline actionable because it's vague on how to apply the differences.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review refers to several methods by their names and briefly describes their features. It doesn't point to specific sections of the paper or provide detailed explanations of what makes each method different. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the parts being discussed. It's more general and doesn't pin down the exact areas of comparison.\n\nFor verifiability, the review makes a claim by stating that the proposed method is different from the others. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just mentions the previous works without explaining why they are different or how the proposed method overcomes those differences. So, it's not well-supported, making it borderline verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is asking a question about differences without giving concrete suggestions or context. It doesn't help the authors by guiding them on how to improve their work or by providing clear feedback. It's more of a descriptive comment rather than a helpful one.

This is a general statement without specific actions. It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to fix or how to improve. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of a suggestion without details, making it borderline actionable because it's vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions the paper not reading well but doesn't specify which part or what exactly is wrong. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint the issue. This means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the problematic section.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the paper doesn't read well, which is a claim. However, there's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's just an opinion without justification, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment advises proofreading but doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements.

The comments are explicit about the need for analysis but don't specify exactly what to do, like calculating means or variances. So it's explicit but vague on the actions. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to Beta coefficients and Theta, which are specific model parameters. It also mentions a synthetic task where each question depends on the previous answer set. This makes it clear which part of the paper is being addressed, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is good because it's about a specific method and a particular application scenario.

It's suggesting improvements and asking about baselines, which are claims. The justification is vague, just stating the need for analysis without providing specific references or reasoning. So it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review is quite detailed, pointing out specific areas for improvement and asking about Theta and baselines.

It mentions that it's a standard regression problem and that applying standard concentration inequalities is obvious. The reviewer also thinks the math is decorative and that the proposition doesn't contribute to NC as a complexity measure. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out that the proposition is unnecessary and that the math isn't adding value. They're suggesting that the authors should remove it. So, the action is clear: remove the proposition. But the reviewer doesn't explain how to do this or why it's unnecessary in detail. It's more of an implicit suggestion. So, it's not fully actionable because the author still needs to figure out exactly what to do. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions that the proposition is a standard regression problem and that applying standard inequalities is obvious. They also states that the math is decorative and doesn't contribute to NC. The reviewer is referring to the specific part of the paper, which is the proposition and the math around it. So, the grounding is clear because they're pointing out a specific part. Additionally, they explain what's wrong with it, which adds specificity. Therefore, it's **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the proposition is unnecessary and that standard inequalities apply. They're not providing external references or logical reasoning beyond their opinion. This is a subjective judgment without supporting evidence, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is critical of the proposition, suggesting it's decorative and unnecessary.

It doesn't specify how to implement this evaluation, so it's implicit. Since it's not explicit, it's not fully actionable.

It accurately points out the relevant literature, so that's fully grounded. It also clearly specifies what needs to be addressed, which is evaluating the proposed method.

It also mentions that the related work's context and evidence-based methods are shallow. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out specific areas to improve, like adding a focused section and datasets. That's explicit. Now, are the actions clear? The reviewer suggests adding a section, which is direct. But they also mention that the current related work is shallow, which gives a clear direction on what needs to be done. So, it's not just a suggestion but a clear indication of what changes are needed. \n\nI think this is **4: Mostly Actionable** because while the actions are clear, maybe the depth of how to implement them isn't specified. Like, do they mean adding a section, or also including specific datasets? It's a bit vague on the implementation details, so it's mostly actionable but not fully concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about related work, similar datasets, and evidence-based methods.

The claim that the related work is shallow is a judgment, but is there justification? The reviewer doesn't provide specific examples or references to back up their claim that the related work is shallow. Similarly, suggesting adding datasets doesn't provide evidence or references. \n\nSo, the claims are made without sufficient support or justification.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that learning to defer is preferable in certain scenarios and explains how the model is expected to behave. It points out that the practicability is hindered by strong assumptions like ground truth availability and DM's decisions. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is making a statement about the limitations, which implies an action\u2014maybe suggesting that the authors should consider these limitations. But it's not giving a direct action, like suggesting a change or a method. It's more of an observation. So, I think it's **Implicit**. Since it's implicit, it might be **Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest considering these issues, but it's vague on how to proceed. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about ground truth and DM's decisions. It mentions specific elements like biases, uncertainties, and behaviors. The reviewer is accurately pinpointing the referenced parts, so that's **Full Grounding**. Then, it clearly specifies what's wrong with these parts, so it's also **Specific**. Therefore, this should be a **5**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the model's practicability is impaired by strong assumptions. It provides some reasoning about the need for ground truth and DM decisions but doesn't cite external references or logical reasoning in depth. It's somewhat justified but lacks robust evidence. So, I'd rate this as **Somewhat Verifiable**, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out significant limitations of the model's approach, which is helpful for the authors to know. It provides clear feedback on areas that need improvement. While it's not the most detailed, it's still quite useful.

I think this would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the theorem and experiment but doesn't clearly identify which part. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not specific enough. Maybe a 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific? Wait, no. If it's not clearly pinpointing, it's weakly grounded. But since it does mention the theorem and experiment, maybe it's weakly grounded but not specific. So, perhaps 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If it doesn't clearly identify the part, it's weakly grounded. But it does mention specific sections, so maybe it's weakly grounded and specific. I'll go with 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests the paper misses communication costs but doesn't provide any justification or references.

That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a significant issue but doesn't offer any suggestions or solutions. It just criticizes the paper's lack of discussion. This is not helpful because authors need guidance on how to improve, not just a critique.

It suggests that different densities cause semantic conflicts and should be justified experimentally or theoretically. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a problem (motivation unclear) and giving a direction (justify with experiments or theory). That seems explicit because they're directly telling the authors what to do. Now, is it concrete? They're not just saying \"justify,\" but they're specifying how to do it\u2014either experimentally or theoretically. So that's concrete because it tells the authors exactly what methods to use. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability since it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions different densities causing semantic conflicts but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It just says \"this should be justified experimentally or theoretically.\" So the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. They know the problem exists but don't know where to focus their justification. Therefore, grounding specificity is weak, so it should be a 3.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment contains a claim that the motivation is unclear and that justification is needed. It also suggests methods (experiments or theory) to address this. The justification is logical\u2014without justification, the motivation isn't convincing. They're providing a clear reasoning why the justification is needed. So this is fully verifiable because the reasoning is solid and logical.

It also mentions that Figure 5 has similar flaws to Figure 1. The action here is clear: the authors need to clarify the training method. It's explicit, so that's good. Then, the reviewer suggests that Figure 5 doesn't add new information, which implies the authors should avoid redundancy. The action is explicit, and the details are clear, so this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer refers to Figure 5 by name, which is specific. They also mention that the figure has similar flaws to Figure 1, which is a clear reference. The comment is specific about the figures, so the grounding is strong. They also suggest avoiding redundancy, which is a clear point about the paper's content, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that Figure 5's visualization is redundant. They're suggesting that if there's no new point, there's no need to repeat it. This is a claim because it's an opinion or judgment about the paper's redundancy. The justification is that Figure 5 doesn't add new information, which is a logical reasoning. They reference Figure 1 as an example, which is an external reference. So, this is fully verifiable because it's supported by logical reasoning and an external reference.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a redundancy issue, which is a weakness.

It mentions parameters of BFNs versus BFN-produced distributions and that ParamReL is similar to infoDiffusion but applied to BFNs.

But does it give a direct instruction on what to do? It seems more like a question rather than a directive action. So, maybe it's not fully actionable because the author still needs to figure out the benefit themselves.

So, it's explicit in pointing out the need but lacks concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know the issue, but they don't know how to address it. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions hallucinations but doesn't reference a specific part of the paper. It's a general statement without pinpointing where the problem lies. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the section or issue.

It's explicit about the terms and clearly states the null hypothesis, so that's direct. It doesn't leave much for the author to infer. The action is to recognize these terms and understand the null hypothesis, which is concrete. So I think this is highly actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to specific statistical terms without making educated guesses. It's literal in mentioning Type-1 and Type-2 errors, so the grounding is full. It also clearly states what's wrong with the null hypothesis, so specificity is high. Therefore, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim by pointing out the use of these terms and the null hypothesis.

The reviewer does suggest improvements but doesn't specify exactly what changes should be made. They mention the method is incremental, which is a bit vague.

But the suggestion is vague because it doesn't specify how to improve motion guidance or what changes to make. So, it's not explicit, and the action isn't concrete. It's more of an implicit suggestion without details. So, this should be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does state an action but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the section on data preprocessing and mentions motion guidance. It's clear which part it's talking about, so the grounding is full. It also explains why the current approach isn't effective, which adds specificity. So, this should be a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the current approach doesn't significantly simplify complexity and suggests exploring another method. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up these claims. The justification is vague, so it's **2: Borderline Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers suggestions but doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to implement them. It's clear that the authors need to explore another method, but without specifics, it's somewhat helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review point is asking whether the results are due to the method or the kernel function. It's suggesting a possible improvement by changing the kernel. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. They might need to figure out how to test different kernels themselves. So, it's not giving a clear action, which makes it borderline actionable. I think it's a 2 because it's implicit and vague.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is pointing out a specific issue with the kernel choice, so the authors can identify exactly where the problem is. It's not just a general critique but specifically about the kernel function. That means it's fully grounded because it clearly references a specific part of the paper.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim that the results could be due to the kernel. To verify this, the authors would need to conduct experiments with different kernels, which is logical reasoning. There's no external reference provided, but the reasoning is solid. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it has logical reasoning but lacks an external citation.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a specific concern and asking for an experiment. It's clear and constructive, guiding the authors to test their hypothesis. It's helpful because it's specific and actionable, even though it doesn't provide the exact experiment. So, it's a 4 because it's mostly helpful with a clear suggestion but could be expanded.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are: actionability 2, grounding 5, verifiability 4, helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

Hence, **1: Not Grounded**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is pointing out a missing description. It's a claim that something is missing. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. It's just stating that the description is missing without explaining why it's a problem or how it affects the algorithm. So, it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out a deficiency but doesn't offer any suggestions or explanations. It's just stating the problem without providing any guidance on how to address it. So, it's not helpful at all. Therefore, **1: Not Helpful at All**.\n\nI think that's all.

It also points out that while some aspects are analyzed, a discussion on training costs is missing. Now, looking at the definitions, an action is explicit if it's direct. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a potential issue but doesn't specify how to address it. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's vague about how to implement the improvement, it's not concrete. So, this is borderline actionable because it does hint at an action but doesn't provide clear steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about computational costs but doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to. They mention the method's complexity but don't tie it to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. They also don't provide specific examples or mention external work, so specificity is lacking. Therefore, this is weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer suggests that training costs should be discussed but doesn't provide any justification or references. They're making a judgment about the importance of this discussion but lack supporting evidence. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a suggestion, but no backing, making it borderline.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review does point out a potential improvement area and suggests discussing training costs, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or references. It's clear that the authors need to address this, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.

It doesn't clearly explain the unique contributions. I think the comment is explicit about the lack of groundbreakingness, which is an action. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to improve or what specific changes to make. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about contrastive decoding techniques but doesn't specify which ones. It's a bit vague, so the grounding isn't fully there. It's not weakly grounded because it's not clear which part is addressed. But it's not fully grounded either. Maybe a 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific? Wait, no. The grounding is weak because it's not clearly pinpointing the issue. So, maybe 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests the method isn't groundbreaking but doesn't provide evidence or references. It's making a judgment that it's not groundbreaking, which is a claim. But there's no justification or references, so it's unverifiable.

It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do, like suggesting a change or a specific fix. It's more of a general statement pointing out a problem without providing actionable steps. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what to do next. Maybe they should be told to reorganize the table or use a different format. Therefore, this is **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 4 but doesn't specify what part of the figure is problematic. It refers to the figure in general without pointing to a specific section or element. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded since it's too vague. Hence, this is **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment states that the figure's representation is not intuitive. It doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is an issue. There's no reference to standards, practices, or external literature supporting this claim. Therefore, it's **Unverifiable** because there's no backing to validate the statement.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out that Figure 4 is not intuitive.

It's explicit about the action, like exploring other baselines and evaluating uncertainty estimation. It also provides some direction on how to assess calibration. So, this is explicit and gives clear steps, making it actionable. I think this is a 5 because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions specific frameworks and the impact on calibration, which are clear parts of the paper. It doesn't just refer to a general area but points to specific sections or concepts. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately identifies the parts being discussed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting other baselines and questioning the impact. It's supported by logical reasoning about different loss functions and their implications on calibration. It references common knowledge in machine learning, so it's well-justified. This should be a 5 because it's thoroughly supported.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is very specific, suggesting alternative approaches and asking about calibration.

They explain that TL is a broader term and that standard MTL is parallel, not sequential. The review suggests that the original text is misleading. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out that the original statement is incorrect. So, the action is clear: the authors should correct the characterization of TL and MTL. But does the reviewer give enough detail on how to do this? They mention that TL is broader and that standard MTL is parallel, but they don't specify exactly where the original text is or what changes should be made. So, it's explicit that the authors need to fix something, but it's vague on the specifics. That makes it borderline actionable because the action is clear, but the implementation details aren't provided.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about TL being a broader term and standard MTL being parallel. They don't reference a specific part of the paper, so they can't point to an exact section or figure. They make a general comment, which means the grounding is weak. They do, however, clearly specify what's wrong with the original statement, which adds some specificity.

Then it talks about CLIP guidance using two losses, which is also explicit. The last part is a bit vague: \"Captions of figures are often not explanatory of what they are illustrating.\" It suggests a problem but doesn't specify how to fix it, so that's more implicit.

It's a clear question, so it's explicit. But does it give enough detail? The reviewer is asking about the method, so the author needs to explain how it's done. It's not vague; it's specific about the exhaustiveness. So, this should be actionable because the author can look into whether the selection is exhaustive or not. I think this is 4: Mostly Actionable because it's explicit but might need more detail on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is asking about the CAL-MIR selection, which is a specific method. They're asking about m', which is a parameter, so the reviewer is pinpointing a specific part of the method. The comment is clear about what's being addressed, so it's fully grounded. Then, they're asking about exhaustiveness, which is specific about the approach. So, this should be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific because it accurately identifies the part and clearly specifies the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is asking a question about whether the selection is exhaustive. This is a claim because it's making a judgment about the method. The justification is just a question, which isn't very detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the problem setup is over black box optimization, so optimality gap is the right metric. It points out that this isn't part of their proposal and suggests focusing on regression for prediction accuracy. It also says the optimization is a downstream task and should be consistent regardless of the regression mechanism. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions. It does suggest looking at regression accuracy and comparing to strong baselines, which is explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to implement this? It says \"I would like to see the accuracy...\" which is a clear action, but it doesn't specify how to measure it or what baselines to use. So it's explicit but not very detailed on the implementation steps. That would make it somewhat actionable but maybe not fully.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the problem setup, regression, and strong baselines. It mentions specific parts like prediction accuracy and downstream tasks. It doesn't just say \"the paper\" but specifically points out these sections. So the grounding is pretty solid because it clearly identifies the parts the authors need to focus on.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review contains a claim that the contribution is about regression, not optimization. It supports this by stating that the optimization is a downstream task. The reasoning is logical, explaining that the focus is on prediction rather than optimization. It doesn't cite external references, but the logic is clear and sufficient. So this is thoroughly supported, making it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a specific area for improvement by suggesting comparing their method's accuracy to strong baselines.

It's unclear which part needs improvement. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the exact area. The specificity is also low since it doesn't clearly explain what's wrong or how to fix it. This would be a **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clear where the issue is, but it does mention the need for more extensive work.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests a bigger-scale experiment but doesn't provide any evidence or references to support this claim. It's just a suggestion without justification, so it's not verifiable. This would be a **1: Unverifiable** because there's no supporting reasoning or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out the need for a bigger experiment but doesn't offer specific suggestions or examples. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. This would be a **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify an area for improvement but doesn't fully address the authors' needs.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

The action here is suggesting improvements, but it's vague. It doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done, like adding a method section or explaining algorithms. So, it's not explicit. Since it's vague, it's not actionable enough. I think this is borderline actionable because it does suggest an action but doesn't give specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions Equation (13) but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's unclear whether it's a specific section, figure, or another element. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the exact issue. It's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the equation lacks a closed-form solution and suggests providing experimental details. It's a claim that needs support. The suggestion about experiments and computational complexity is somewhat justified but lacks specific references or examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a logical reasoning but not enough evidence or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a clear weakness in the paper and provides suggestions for improvement. It's helpful because it addresses a specific issue and offers actionable advice. However, the suggestions are quite vague, so while it's helpful, it's not the most helpful because it doesn't go into much detail.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 2 (Weakly Grounded and Not Specific)\n- Verifiability: 3 (Somewhat Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It points out that while proximity in Cartesian positions is correlated with solution space proximity, this doesn't hold for certain tasks like mazes or robotic ones with obstacles. The comment suggests analyzing which tasks have good proximity metrics and demonstrating failure on those that don't. \n\nThis is explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. It's not just a vague suggestion but a clear action. Also, it's concrete because it tells them exactly where to focus their analysis. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review talks about the nature of the tasks, specifically mentioning robotic tasks with obstacles and mazes. It clearly identifies the specific areas the paper should address. So, the grounding is strong because it pinpoints exactly where the issue lies. It's not just a general statement but specifically addresses the paper's sections.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests analyzing tasks and demonstrating failure. It doesn't provide specific references or examples, but it's clear what needs to be done. There's logical reasoning that the paper should delve into these aspects, but without external citations, it's somewhat supported.

The review suggests two possible improvements for SSUL: using Mask2Former for region proposals or generating proposals unsupervised. It's pretty explicit about these suggestions, so that's good. But does it tell the authors exactly how to implement these changes? It says \"adopt Mask2Former\" or \"generate proposals unsupervised,\" which are clear actions. So, it's explicit and gives concrete steps. That should be a high score on actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions specific models like Mask2Former and references a citation [b]. It's clear which parts are being addressed\u2014SSUL's current method versus using a different detector. The grounding is solid because it points to specific components and references an external source, making it easy for the authors to understand the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides logical reasoning by comparing the use of different detectors and their impact on the comparison's fairness. It also cites external literature, which adds credibility. The justification is thorough, so this should score high on verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review offers clear, actionable suggestions and references external work, which is very helpful for the authors. It guides them on potential improvements without being vague.

It gives examples like style accuracy relying on a classifier and the transfer results being hard to verify. The comment suggests improvements but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done. It's a bit vague. So, it's not explicit, but it's pointing out areas that need attention. I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest actions but doesn't detail how to implement them.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about style accuracy and transfer results but doesn't clearly point to specific sections or tables in the paper. It's making general comments without pinpointing exactly where the issues are.

It suggests the authors might have interpreted \"preference\" as rules or policies. This is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors where the issue lies and what they need to clarify. It doesn't ask them to infer, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly where the problem is and what to look into. So, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions how preferences are generated but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It's a bit vague because it doesn't point to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The specificity about the problem is clear, though, as it's about the generation of individual preferences.

The reviewer is pointing out specific issues, so that's explicit. But they're also asking for clarification on terms like \"action repeat,\" which might require the authors to infer how to fix it. So it's a bit implicit. Since the comment is clear about the issues, it's somewhat actionable, but the need for clarification makes it a bit vague. So I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment is about Figure 4, so the reviewer is trying to identify which part of the paper is affected. They mention \"1-200 frames\" but don't specify exactly which figure or section. They also ask about trajectory length and action repeats, which are general topics. So the grounding isn't very specific because they can't pinpoint the exact issue.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the loss functions aren't new and points out specific losses like JS divergence, masked CE, and masked spherical loss. It suggests the attacks are white-box and that there's no black-box evaluation, which is a limitation. It also recommends extending the analysis to targeted attacks. \n\nLooking at explicitness, the reviewer is making clear suggestions, so that's explicit. For concreteness, they specify which loss functions and mention the type of attacks and the need for targeted evaluations. So, it's both explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5 for actionability because the suggestions are clear and detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer refers to specific loss functions and mentions white-box and targeted attacks. They don't just say \"the paper,\" but rather points out particular aspects. So, they're fully grounded because they clearly identify the sections or parts being discussed. The specificity is good because they outline what needs improvement. So, this should also be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the novelty of the loss functions and the limitations of the attacks. They provide some reasoning, like explaining that the attacks are white-box and suggesting targeted attacks. However, they don't cite external references or provide detailed justification beyond their reasoning. It's somewhat supported but not fully verifiable. So, I'd rate this a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer offers several specific points: pointing out the lack of novelty, suggesting limitations, and recommending extensions. These are clear and actionable for the authors. While it's not the most detailed, it's still very helpful. I think a 4 here is appropriate because while the suggestions are good, they could be expanded a bit more.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect is a 5 except for verifiability and helpfulness, which are 4s.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

Then it mentions that a smaller training set could be avoided by training on the complete train+val set. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions. The first part is a bit vague, saying \"I do agree that proper hyperparameter tuning is essential in ML, but the wording is a bit hard in my opinion.\" That's more of a critique than an actionable suggestion. The second part, however, does give a specific action: \"train the network with optimal parameters on the complete train+val set.\" That's explicit and concrete. So, the review is partially actionable because it provides a clear instruction but also has a vague part about the wording. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the explicit action is there, but the vague critique isn't helpful for the authors to make changes.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions \"243 is rather surprising\" and refers to a specific line (245) about the training set. It clearly points to a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is strong. It also explains why the issue is problematic by mentioning that a smaller training set might be avoided by using the complete train+val set. This specificity helps the authors understand exactly where the problem lies and what needs to be fixed.

They're referring to different levels of expertise between Alice and Bob. However, they don't specify which part of the paper or task they're addressing. They're making a general statement about the assumption, not pinpointing a specific section or issue. So, the grounding is weak because they can't accurately identify which part is being discussed. They're not providing specific details about the task or where the issue lies, just a general observation.\n\nTherefore, **Grounding Specificity** is **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because they can't confidently determine the specific part and don't provide specific details.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the assumption might not hold in real-world tasks. They're suggesting that there could be non-linear interactions due to varying expertise. Is this claim supported by evidence? The reviewer doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back up their claim. They're just stating an observation without justification. So, it's not fully supported, making it **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue with the assumption but doesn't provide actionable steps or specific advice on how to address it. They're making a general caution without offering concrete solutions. This makes the feedback somewhat helpful but not very detailed or useful. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does provide some insight but lacks depth and direction.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It's an explicit action because the reviewer is pointing out a specific data point they want the authors to analyze. However, the action is quite vague. The reviewer doesn't specify how to analyze the distribution or what changes should be made. So, it's not very actionable. I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable because it's clear what needs to be done, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions ACL, EMNLP, and Arxiv explicitly, so that's good grounding.

It seems like the reviewer is giving a suggestion, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer isn't just saying to focus more; they're giving a direction. So, the action is clear: focus on the problem and framework. That makes it actionable. So, I think this is highly actionable, which would be a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity.

It mentions the advantages over alternatives are unclear. I think this is **Implicit** because it's giving a problem but not telling the authors exactly what to do. It's more about pointing out issues without clear solutions. So, it's not explicit, hence probably a lower score.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about mixed-integer programming but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's vague about what needs fixing. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or issue. It's more general, so I'd give it a lower score.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review mentions the choice isn't justified and advantages are unclear.

The second is that Pedersen et al 2007 is missing. For actionability, I need to check if these comments are explicit and concrete. The first point suggests a change, which is clear, but the second is about missing a reference, which also needs a specific action. Both are explicit and provide clear instructions on what to do, so they should be actionable. Therefore, this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The first comment refers to Equation 1, which is specific. The second comment mentions a missing reference, which is also specific. Both are grounded because they point to exact sections or references. So, this should be a high score, perhaps 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the first comment is a suggestion to change notation, which is a claim. It doesn't provide evidence or references, so it's unverifiable. The second comment is about a missing reference, which is a claim that needs justification. Since there's no justification provided, it's also unverifiable. So both points are unverifiable, giving a score of 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The first comment is clear and actionable, which helps the author. The second comment points out a missing reference, which is useful but doesn't specify how to fix it. It's somewhat helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review mentions that the second contribution is combining SSMs with Attention, which isn't new and points to MEGA and Block-state Transformer. It also says the architecture in Figure 5 is similar to Mega. The reviewer suggests discussing similarities and differences and doing ablation studies. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, the reviewer is directly telling the authors to discuss these points. So that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is giving specific areas to discuss, like the architecture in Figure 5 and comparing it to Mega. They also mention ablation studies, which are clear steps. So, this seems highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions specific works (MEGA and Block-state Transformer) and a specific figure (Figure 5). They also suggest comparing to Mega, which is a concrete part of the paper. So, the reviewer is accurately pointing out specific sections and what needs to be addressed there. That means the grounding is fully specific because it's clear which part of the paper is being referred to and what exactly needs improvement.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is making a claim here by pointing out that the architecture is similar to Mega and suggesting ablation studies. They provide references, which are external sources, and logical reasoning about the need for discussion. So, the claim is well-supported with references and clear explanations, making it fully verifiable.\n\nHelpfulness. The reviewer is providing clear feedback on the contribution's novelty, pointing to specific prior work, suggesting a detailed comparison, and recommending ablation studies. This is very helpful because it guides the authors to address specific issues and provides a clear structure for their response. It's thorough and actionable, so it's highly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at the highest level: 5 for all.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review point is asking if there's a specific reason for reporting results on a few select environments. It's a yes/no question, but it's more of a clarification. The reviewer is seeking information, so the action here is implicit. They're asking for clarification, but they're not providing a direct action like suggesting a change or providing data. So, it's not explicit. Since it's implicit, the actionability is low. I think it's borderline actionable because it's asking for clarification, which is a form of implicit action, but it's vague because the reviewer isn't specifying what they need.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review point is asking about a specific part of the paper, which is section 4.3. The reviewer is pointing out that they're only reporting results on a few environments. So, they're clearly identifying a specific section, which is section 4.3. They're also implying that this is a limitation or reason for only reporting on those environments. So, the grounding is full because they're accurately pinpointing the section and explaining why it's limited. The specificity is also high because they're not just mentioning the section but also explaining the reason, which adds clarity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review point is a claim because it's making a judgment about why results are limited to specific environments. The reviewer is stating an opinion that the results are only on a few environments, which is a claim. Now, is this claim verifiable? The reviewer is providing an explanation that it's a limitation, but they don't back it up with external references or logical reasoning. They're just stating it as a fact. So, the verifiability is low. It's borderline because they're making a claim but not supporting it with evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review point is asking for clarification on why only a few environments were tested. It's a straightforward question, but it's not providing much direction for the authors. They're not suggesting any changes or offering solutions, just asking for an explanation. So, while it's helpful in that it's seeking information, it's not very actionable. It's somewhat helpful because it does provide a reason for the limitation, but it's not constructive enough to guide the authors on how to improve their work.

It's a major concern, especially for texts with evolving vocabularies. Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are.

It also questions why one can't measure probability differences. The response would need to explain both why the original statement is true and why measuring probabilities isn't feasible.

It mentions laying out alternatives and experiments to discriminate between them. This is an explicit action, so it's clear what needs to be done. The action is also concrete because it specifies what experiments should be conducted. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review talks about alternative hypotheses and experiments, which are specific parts of the paper. It's not just a general statement but points to specific areas, so the grounding is full. It also clearly specifies what needs to be addressed, making it specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the current analysis is confirmatory and suggests additional experiments. It provides some reasoning about why more work is needed, which is logical. It doesn't cite external references, but the reasoning is clear and based on common knowledge.

Third, the constraints are written as C(A, x), which is unusual. Each of these points is explicit and gives clear actions for the authors to take. For example, they need to clarify the purpose, adjust the variable, and explain the constraints. So, the review is explicit and provides actionable steps. It's not vague or implicit. Therefore, this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions Equation (1) and points out specific issues without making general comments. It clearly references the equation and the problems with the loss function, variable, and constraints. There's no mention of other parts of the paper, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is high because it explains exactly what's wrong with the equation. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides clear justifications. It explains why each issue is a problem and suggests possible fixes. For example, it mentions that the loss function is unclear, which can be verified by the authors. The variable issue is a common point of confusion, and the unusual constraint notation is non-standard. These justifications are logical and well-supported, so this should be **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is very helpful because it directly addresses potential issues the authors might face.

So, this seems to have good grounding because it's specific about the part of the paper being discussed.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review states that the dependency on LLMs introduces biases or inconsistencies. Verifiability is about whether the claims are supported. The claim here is that there's a reliance on LLMs, which is a valid concern. The support provided is a bit vague, though\u2014it mentions potential biases but doesn't provide specific examples or references. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it does make a claim and provides some reasoning, but it's not as robust as it could be.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue with the evaluation method but doesn't offer concrete solutions or suggest improvements. It's more of a critique than a constructive suggestion. Without clear guidance on how to address the reliance on LLMs, the authors might not know what changes to make. Therefore, this review isn't very helpful. I'd rate it as **2: Barely Helpful** because it identifies a problem but doesn't provide actionable steps.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding_specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 3\n- Helpfulness: 2\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests looking at more empirical examples and comparing to SOTA performance using Eq 12, but it's unclear. I think the action here is to look at Eq 12, but it's vague. They don't specify how to use it or where to find the empirical examples. So, it's not explicit, and the details are lacking. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions SOTA performance and Eq 12 but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where to find these references. It's too vague about the exact section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the exact part being addressed. I'd give this a 2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests looking at Eq 12 and comparing to SOTA, but it's unclear how. There's no clear justification or references provided. It seems like the claim is that Eq 12 is effective, but without supporting evidence, it's hard to verify. So, this is borderline verifiable, maybe a 2.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential improvement but doesn't specify how to implement it. It's vague and lacks concrete suggestions. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very.

Assumption 1 literally enforces that the adversary cannot pick arbitrary S, but only those such that a constant alpha-fraction of the observations are hidden/removed.\" It mentions that after removal, there are alpha * m pairs, which is sufficient for recovery if m = O(k log n). \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out what the assumption does, but they don't explicitly tell the author how to fix the problem or what changes to make. So, it's implicit. Since it's not giving a direct action, it's not actionable. So, I'd give it a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about the adversary's limitations but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're addressing. They mention the assumption but don't clearly identify the section or table. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint the referenced part. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 1.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim about the adversary's limitations and the sufficiency of the remaining data. They provide some reasoning but it's vague. They don't cite external references or give a clear justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd rate it a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer raises a concern but doesn't offer specific suggestions or clarify the implications. They mention the assumption but don't explain how it affects the problem or what changes the author should make. This is helpful but not very detailed.

It's not just a vague statement; it's pointing to exact sections. So this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that Figure 1 contradicts Table 1. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. It just states it. So this is unverifiable, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out a contradiction but doesn't suggest fixes or improvements.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests looking into the extensibility of the method across many tasks and asks about the impact on shared parameters. It also provides experiments for up to 20 tasks. The action here is clear: authors should address how the number of tasks affects the approach. The comment is explicit about the need to explore this, so that's explicit. It also gives some direction by mentioning experiments, which is concrete. So, this seems highly actionable because it tells authors exactly what to do and how to apply it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions tasks and shared parameters, which are specific parts of the paper. It doesn't just say \"many tasks\" but refers to the number of tasks and their impact. It also points out that experiments are limited, which helps authors pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. So, this is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the sections and aspects being discussed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the method's extensibility is a concern, specifically about shared parameters. It suggests looking into multitask learning and provides some experimental results. The reasoning is logical, and the references to existing challenges in multitask learning are clear. The verifiability is high because it's supported by logical reasoning and examples, making it easy for authors to understand and verify.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking a specific question about the method's scalability and providing some context. It's clear and directly addresses a potential concern authors might have. While it doesn't go into every possible concern, it's comprehensive enough to be helpful. The suggestions are actionable, so it's highly helpful as it guides authors on where to focus their improvements.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at the highest level: 5 for all.

The action here is pointing out that the analysis is extensive. Is this explicit or implicit? It seems explicit because it's directly stating what was done. Now, is it concrete? It mentions regressions and exclusions, so the authors know exactly what was done. So this should be 5: Highly Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions eyetracking data but doesn't specify which part of the paper or data set. It's just a general critique without pinpointing the exact issue. So the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. Therefore, this would be 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about the analysis being extensive, which is a subjective opinion.

It mentions that while InitNO improved text-image alignment on StableDiffusion-v1-4, Table 6 shows a lower alignment than the baseline. \n\nIs this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is pointing out a discrepancy in the results, which implies that the authors should investigate the Appendix. So, it's explicit because they're directly telling the authors where to look. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how to fix it or what exactly is wrong, just that the results are questionable. So, it's somewhat actionable because the authors know where to check, but they don't know how to proceed next. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions the Appendix results specifically. They refer to Table 6, which is a unique part of the paper. So, the grounding is full because they're accurately pinpointing the section. The specificity is also high because they clearly state what's wrong with the results. So, this would be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the results are questionable and that the alignment is lower.

It also mentions considering dropping some sub/superscripts. The action here is clear: editing and possibly simplifying notation. The comment provides specific actions, so it's explicit. Additionally, it gives concrete details on where to make changes, so it's not vague.

It also mentions two questions on Line 79 and asks for clarification on Line 263. The comments are explicit about needing more details, so they provide clear actions for the authors. However, they don't specify exactly how to collect the data or what constitutes \"politically sensitive.\" So, while the actions are clear, the details are vague. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific sections like Line 263, which is about \"regulatory requirements\" and \"politically sensitive\" content. It accurately points to a specific part of the paper, so grounding is strong. The specificity comes from asking about what's considered politically sensitive, which is a clear request for more information. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting the authors need to explain certain aspects. It provides some reasoning, like pointing out that the dataset's size and cost are issues, but it doesn't cite external references or provide examples. It's somewhat supported but lacks depth.

But the specificity is low because the reviewer is just asking why it's named, not what the implications are or how it affects the work. So, it's fully grounded but not specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim? Well, the reviewer is asking a question, not making a judgment. So, it's a normal statement, which means verifiability isn't applicable here. So, it's an X for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking why the method is named a certain way. While it's a good question, it doesn't provide specific actionable feedback. The authors still don't know how to improve their work based on this. So, it's somewhat helpful because it does address a potential weakness (the naming convention), but it's vague and doesn't offer concrete suggestions. Therefore, it's a 3 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Borderline Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Not Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, I need to evaluate the given review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point says that on page 5, when referring to the \"best\" candidate, the author should explicitly define what \"best\" means. It clarifies that \"best\" refers to candidates relevant for prediction, confidence scores, etc. \n\nThis is explicit because it directly tells the author where to make the definition. It's not just a suggestion but a clear instruction. So, it's actionable. It also provides concrete details about what \"best\" means, so it's not vague. Therefore, this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions page 5 and specifies that \"best\" refers to candidates relevant for prediction or confidence. It doesn't just point to a section but explains what aspect of that section is being discussed. It's clear and specific, so this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about what \"best\" means and suggesting where to define it. It's a claim that needs to be supported. The justification is logical\u2014explaining that defining \"best\" is necessary for clarity. It doesn't reference external sources, but the reasoning is clear. So, it's **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear feedback on where to define \"best\" and explains the criteria. It's helpful because it guides the author to improve clarity. It's somewhat detailed but could be expanded, so it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think each aspect is evaluated based on the definitions provided.

Explicitly, it points out the omission of feed-forward, which is an action the authors can take. However, the mention of considering all transformer components is vague and not clear on how to apply it. So, it's explicit but not concrete. I think this is a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"transformer networks\" generally, not pointing to a specific part of the paper. It doesn't clearly identify which section or unique aspect is being discussed. So, the grounding is weak because it's not specific enough. I'd rate this a 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the method doesn't consider feed-forward layers. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so there's no support for the claim.

So, it's not giving explicit actions. It's more of a statement pointing out a problem without suggesting fixes. That makes it borderline actionable because it hints at an issue but doesn't provide clear steps. So, I'd rate it a 2.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions specific methods but doesn't tell the authors where exactly these methods are in the paper. It's vague about which part of the paper needs improvement.

It's a general statement about a model property. There's no mention of a section, figure, or unique aspect of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint where the issue is. It's just a broad statement, so I'd rate this as **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim about identifiability being data-dependent. It needs to be supported. However, the justification is vague.

The reviewer is pointing out that this is a bold assumption. Now, is this actionable? The reviewer is making a judgment about the manuscript's claim but isn't providing a specific action or suggestion. They're critiquing the statement but not guiding how to improve it. So, this isn't explicit or concrete. It's more of a general critique without a clear next step. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. Maybe it's borderline because it's pointing out a problem, but without a solution, it's not actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions Section 3.7, which is specific. So, they've identified the part of the paper they're talking about. That's good grounding. Now, they're critiquing the assumption but don't specify what needs to be addressed in that section. They're saying it's a bold assumption, but not what to do about it. So, the grounding is there, but the specificity is lacking because they're not explaining what to change. It's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the assumption is bold. Is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out that the manuscript made a statement, but they're not providing evidence or justification for why that assumption is bold. They're just stating an opinion. There's no supporting reasoning or references, so it's not verifiable. It's more of a judgment without backing.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a critique but isn't providing any suggestions or justification. They're leaving the authors with just a negative statement without any guidance. This isn't helpful because the authors don't know what to do next.

It doesn't provide explicit instructions on what the authors should do. So, it's not giving clear actions like suggesting specific edits or improvements. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. It's more of a statement pointing out gaps without guiding the authors on how to address them. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable because it does explicitly state the issue but lacks detail on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions specific works [A], [18], and [B], and references their performance on specific datasets like SUN and CUB. It clearly identifies the parts of the paper being addressed, like related work sections and tables. It also specifies what's missing, which adds clarity. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the paper misses discussing certain related work and recent advancements. It supports this with references to [A], [18], and [B], which are cited in the literature. The evidence is there, so it's thoroughly supported. This should be a 5: Fully Verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out specific gaps in the paper's discussion of related work and suggests areas for improvement.

It points out specific metrics in the tables. I think this is explicit because it directly states the issue. But is it concrete? The review tells the authors where the problem is but doesn't explain how to fix it. So, it's explicit but not concrete. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review references specific tables and metrics. It's clear which parts of the paper are being discussed, so the grounding is strong. It's fully grounded because it points to exact sections, and it's specific because it mentions the exact metrics. So, that's a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that UnKE's performance is worse than the baseline. It supports this with references to specific tables and metrics. The justification is clear and provides enough evidence, so this should be a 5. There's a claim made, and it's well-supported.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a clear weakness and provides specific metrics.

It suggests including it in the revision, maybe as supplementary material or in the main paper. Is this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors exactly what to do. But is it concrete? It says to include it, but doesn't specify how. So it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this would be a 3 for Actionability because it's explicit but vague on the implementation.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions including the proof in the revision, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly. It just says \"include it.\" So the authors have to guess where it was omitted. That's weak grounding because it's not precise.

It's a clear question, but does it give any specific action? The user is being asked to consider this relationship, but there's no explicit instruction on what to do next. So, it's more of a question than a directive. Therefore, it's not providing actionable feedback. It's borderline because it could be expanded into a suggestion, but as it stands, it's not actionable.

It doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is being discussed. The mention of $m$ and $G_m$ is too general and doesn't pinpoint the issue. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 1.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review point is a question, which doesn't present a claim that needs verification. It's more of a probing question rather than a statement that requires justification. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiability. So, this would be an \"X\" for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review point is a question that doesn't provide any specific feedback or suggestions. It's asking about a relationship without offering any guidance on how to improve or what changes might be necessary. Without any actionable items, it's not helpful at all.

It's a yes/no question, but it doesn't provide any specific actions or suggestions on how to apply it. So, it's not giving the authors a clear direction on what to do next. Therefore, it's not actionable because it's vague and doesn't specify how to implement the idea.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is asking about applying the technique to generation tasks in general. It doesn't mention a specific part of the paper or any particular aspect of generation tasks. So, the grounding is weak because it's too broad and doesn't pinpoint where the issue lies. The authors can't tell exactly what part they need to focus on.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment is a question, which is a normal statement. It doesn't contain a claim that needs justification. Since it's just a question without supporting evidence, it's not verifiable. There's no logical reasoning, references, or examples provided to back it up.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is asking a question but doesn't provide any meaningful feedback or suggestions. It doesn't help the authors understand what needs to be done or why it's important.

The comment is explicit about the issue and provides a clear action: explaining the undefined term. It doesn't leave much to the authors to infer, so it's explicit. Also, it gives a concrete action, so it's not vague. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment mentions $N_d$ but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It just says \"different number of observations per task,\" which is a bit vague. So the grounding isn't fully explicit. It's not weakly grounded because it doesn't clearly point to the section or variable. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that $N_d$ needs clarification. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or reasoning. It just states that it's good to explain it. So there's no justification or references, making it unverifiable. That's a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a clear issue and suggests a specific improvement. It's direct and provides actionable feedback.

It's pretty explicit about asking for this information, so that's an explicit action. But it's quite vague on how to implement this. The authors would need to look into each method mentioned, identify if they use data augmentations, note the architecture, and check the objective. So, it's explicit but not very detailed.

It suggests comparing LSH with more recent models and using newer benchmarks. The action here is clear: evaluate LSH against newer architectures and datasets. It's explicit, so that's good. But does it give enough detail? It tells the authors what to do but doesn't specify how to implement it, like exact models or datasets. So it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this is a 3: Somewhat Actionable because it's clear but lacks specifics on how to apply the changes.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to LSTM and LSH, which are specific models, and mentions the PTB benchmark, which is a well-known dataset. It also suggests newer benchmarks, which are specific.

The action here is clear: evaluate scalability and compare with others. But the instructions say that explicit actions are better.

It doesn't just say \"there are some problems\" but points to exact spots in the paper. This means the authors can easily identify where the changes are needed. Additionally, each issue is clearly defined, so the grounding is strong. It's not just a vague comment; it's specific about the parts of the paper being addressed. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides clear justifications for each suggestion. It explains why each correction is needed, like explaining that using max in Line 345 makes sense because it's an optimization step. It also references mathematical concepts, such as the i-th objective function and time steps, which are well-known in the field. The use of the hypervolume formula and uniform distribution is also explained, providing logical reasoning and references.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review says the authors didn't include codes during the review, making claims less transparent. Is this an explicit action? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a specific action for the authors to take. They're just stating that codes weren't included. So, it's not explicit because the authors aren't told exactly what to do. It's more of an implicit comment, so I'd rate this as 2: Borderline Actionable because it's vague on how to improve transparency.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It just says the authors didn't include codes. Without pointing to a specific section or figure, the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. So, the grounding is weak because they can't identify the referenced part. Therefore, this is 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting that not including codes makes claims less transparent. But is this claim supported? Well, it's a general statement about transparency, which is a common knowledge point. However, it's not tied to a specific example or reference, so the justification is lacking. It's somewhat verifiable but not fully, so I'd give it a 3: Somewhat Verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a problem but doesn't offer specific solutions. It tells the authors that codes were missing but doesn't say what they should do next. Without concrete suggestions, the feedback is limited. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully, which would be a 3: Somewhat Helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets a score based on how well the review point provides actionable feedback, grounds the issue specifically, supports the claim with evidence, and offers meaningful suggestions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

I encourage the authors to validate the proposed approach in Waymax in the future, which provides more traffic scenarios (> 100k) compared to just using 4 scenarios in the current version.\" \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review provides clear instructions for the authors. The comment here is encouraging the authors to do something but doesn't specify exactly what they should do. It mentions that Waymax provides more scenarios but doesn't outline steps or how to implement this. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's vague about how to apply this, it's not actionable. So, on a scale of 1 to 5, this would be a 2 because it's borderline actionable\u2014it gives a suggestion but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about validating the approach in Waymax and mentions more traffic scenarios. It does reference a specific tool (Waymax) and a specific metric (more than 100k scenarios). This means the authors can identify exactly where the issue lies, so the grounding is strong. It's fully grounded because it mentions the specific part of the paper or tool. Additionally, it specifies what needs to be addressed, which is validating the approach. So, this would score a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion to validate the approach in Waymax. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for why this is a good idea or how it would help. It's just a recommendation without backing. Therefore, it's unverifiable.

That would be a 3 on the actionable scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions the \"Functional connectivity encoder\" and the graph G_F. They don't explicitly name the section or part of the paper, just refer to it as \"this section.\" So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where. They also don't specify what's wrong with G_F, just that it's unclear. So, grounding is weakly grounded and not specific, which would be a 2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the section is unclear and that the source of patches and mixing is difficult. They need justification for why this is an issue. They don't provide any references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's a subjective opinion without support, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out issues but doesn't provide clear solutions or suggest where to look next. It's vague and lacks depth. The authors might not know how to improve their work based on this feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful but not very. Maybe a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

So, this is borderline actionable because it hints at an issue but doesn't specify how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions Figure 4(b) and compares it to faster training, but it's unclear if this figure is actually showing faster training. They also point out that pruning is a big field and suggest a longer discussion on related work. The mention of Figure 4(b) and the comparison is specific, but the suggestion about related work isn't tied to a specific part of the paper. So, it's weakly grounded because it's not entirely clear which part they're referring to, and the suggestion is a bit vague.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer provides some reasoning about the figure not showing faster training and the suggestion about related work. However, the reasoning is a bit vague. They don't give specific references or examples, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. There's a minor gap in justification.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer's points are clear and suggest areas for improvement. They point out a specific figure and suggest expanding on related work, which is helpful for the authors. It's not the most detailed, but it's still useful and actionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 3 (Weakly Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: 4 (Somewhat Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 4 (Mostly Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It correctly states that the derivative should be -1/2n^{-3/2} instead of the previously mentioned positive value. The comment is explicit about the mistake and provides the correct derivative. It also explains how to compute it, so the authors can directly apply this correction. This seems highly actionable because it's clear and provides a direct fix.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review specifically mentions the derivative of n^{-1/2}, which is a clear part of the paper. It doesn't make any vague claims or guess where the mistake is; it directly references the mathematical expression. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the specific part of the paper being discussed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment claims that the derivative is wrong and provides the correct calculation. This is supported by mathematical reasoning, so it's fully verifiable. There's no ambiguity in the claim, and the reasoning is solid, making it highly verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific error and provides a clear correction.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says the writing is too verbose and hard to follow, suggesting the paper is more of an implementation than a theoretical or general advancement. It also advises focusing on main ideas and analyses rather than a complex system. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer mentions specific issues like being too verbose and not being a theoretical or general paper. That's explicit. However, the suggestion to focus on main ideas is quite vague. It doesn't specify what changes to make, like which sections to condense or what analyses to add. So, it's not fully actionable because the implementation is too broad. Maybe it's somewhat actionable since it points out the issue, but the specifics are lacking. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about the paper being too verbose and not theoretical enough. It doesn't mention specific parts of the paper, like sections or figures. It's a general critique without pinpointing where the issues are. So, the grounding is weak because it can't accurately identify the referenced part. It's not fully grounded since it's a general statement, but it's not specific about what needs fixing. Therefore, this would be 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific? Wait, no. Wait, the comment is general, so it's not specific about the part of the paper. So, it's weakly grounded because it can't confidently identify the referenced part. But it's specific in that it's pointing out a general issue. Hmm, maybe it's 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific because it doesn't clearly specify what needs to be addressed. Or perhaps 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific because it does specify the issue is too verbose, but not the part. I think it's more about not being specific about the part, so maybe 2.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment suggests the paper is too verbose and not theoretical. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support these claims. It's just an opinion without backing. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or references. Therefore, this would be 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out that the writing is too verbose and suggests focusing on main ideas. It's clear and provides some actionable feedback, but the suggestion is quite vague. It doesn't specify how to make the writing more concise or what analyses to include. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. Maybe a 3: Somewhat Helpful.\n\nWait, but the helpfulness is subjective. The comment is clear and identifies a problem, so it's helpful, but the vagueness might lower it. So, 3 seems right.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

This is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors what to do. It also gives concrete details on how to improve the paper, so it's not vague. Therefore, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions \"code and supplementary documentation\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. It's a general suggestion, so the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the resources should be added. However, it's clear what needs to be addressed, so it's somewhat specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim suggesting the benefits of providing code. It's supported by the reasoning that such resources enhance clarity and reproducibility, which are common knowledge. There's no mention of external references, but the reasoning is logical and well-known, so it's fairly verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review clearly identifies a weakness (lack of resources) and provides actionable suggestions.

It's explicit about the need to discuss and compare, which is a clear action. But it doesn't specify how to do the comparison, like whether to use certain metrics or provide detailed analysis. So it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it tells the authors what to do but not exactly how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to ensembles in offline RL, specifically mentioning REM and DQN. It's pretty specific about the methods and areas to discuss. It doesn't just say \"ensembles\" but connects them to specific contexts and techniques. So this is **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it clearly points to the relevant parts of the paper.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that ensembles should be discussed and compared. It provides some reasoning, like REM outperforming DQN, and suggests a simple way to incorporate value uncertainty. However, the reasoning is a bit vague and doesn't cite specific external references beyond the initial mention. It's logical but lacks detailed justification or examples. So I'd rate this as **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions about discussing a related method and comparing techniques.

It's a statement of opinion, so it's a claim. But does it give clear instructions on what to do? The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue but isn't suggesting specific changes. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit comment, which makes it borderline actionable. I think it's a 2 because it's not fully actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions combining two methods but doesn't specify which ones or where. They don't point to a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is weak. They're talking about the methods in general, not a particular section or figure.

The reviewer is talking about \"readers unfamiliar with bAbI or question answering.\" That's pretty specific because they're addressing readers who might not know about these terms. They're also explaining what \"valid words\" mean, which is a specific part of the paper.

The comment is explicit about the need for a more comprehensive comparison but doesn't specify exactly how to do it. So, it's explicit but vague on the action, making it **Borderline Actionable (2)**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the Talking Heads Transformer by name, which is specific, and mentions tasks in the paper, so it's clear which part is being addressed. It also explains why the comparison is needed, which adds specificity.

The comment is pointing out that the Introduction isn't focused enough and suggests a better framing. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors to evaluate the loss function across datasets and mentions applications. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It suggests looking at the loss function's performance across datasets and applying it elsewhere. It gives a clear action: analyze the loss function's performance and consider its applications. So it's concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about the Introduction not being focused on breast cancer, which is a specific part of the paper. It mentions using multiple datasets and the loss function's applications, which are specific areas. The grounding is clear because it directly references the Introduction and specific applications. So this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the Introduction isn't focused enough and suggests a better framing. It's a claim because it's an opinion or suggestion. The justification is that the loss function can be applied to other problems, which is a logical reasoning point. It references applications, so it's somewhat supported but not with external references.

It also says that consecutive sub-trajectories are straightforward and that cross-trajectory chaining has some novelty but is inspired by goal-conditioned RL approaches. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review points out some existing LLMs, which might imply that the authors should consider using those instead. However, it's more of an implicit suggestion rather than a direct action. Also, the part about inspiration from other techniques doesn't provide a clear action. So, it's not fully explicit, and the suggestions are vague. I think this falls under **Borderline Actionable** because it does hint at areas for improvement but doesn't specify exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about LLMs, instruction aggregation, and techniques inspired by RL. It doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper or method is being discussed. The mention of consecutive sub-trajectories and cross-trajectory chaining isn't very specific. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or issue. I'd rate this as **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part or issue.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review mentions existing LLMs and techniques from Chebotar et al., 2021. It provides some justification by citing previous work, which adds credibility. However, the justification isn't very detailed, and it's somewhat vague. So, it's somewhat supported by external references but not fully robust.

Well, it's a request for explanation, which is an action. But does it give a clear direction on how to improve the draft? It's vague because explaining why they chose decoder-only transformers could involve many actions, like discussing model architecture, training methods, etc. So, it's an explicit action but lacks concrete details. Maybe it's borderline actionable because it's clear they need to explain, but not specific on how.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review doesn't mention a specific part of the paper. It's a general request. So, the author can't pinpoint where the issue is. It's not grounded because it doesn't reference any specific section or element of the paper. It's just a broad statement.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim? Wait, no. It's a request for an explanation, which is a suggestion or request, not a claim.

So, it's somewhat helpful but maybe not fully because it's a broad request.

It also suggests including more thoughts on underlying causes and mitigating strategies. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out specific areas that need improvement but doesn't explicitly tell the authors how to fix them. They suggest including more analysis but don't provide a clear method. So, this is more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's not explicit, it's not fully actionable. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest improvements, but the action isn't clearly defined.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the qualitative analysis missing details on error proportions and suggests including more on underlying causes. It mentions \"chain-of-thought prompting\" but doesn't tie it directly to the paper's sections. The grounding here is weak because the reviewer can't pinpoint exactly where the analysis should focus. They're making a general suggestion without clearly identifying the part of the paper that needs more work.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the paper's main results are general and not leveraging unique characteristics of tabular data or LLMs. It suggests that the claims about model multiplicity are too broad. This is an explicit action pointing out a problem, so it's actionable. It doesn't just say \"there's an issue,\" but explains why the results are irrelevant. So, it's explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the paper's claims about model multiplicity in machine learning and then points out that the results don't apply specifically to tabular LLMs. It mentions the unique aspects of the data and models, which are clearly identified. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the specific part of the paper. The specificity is good because it explains why the results are irrelevant. I'd give this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the main results are general and irrelevant. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support this. It's just a statement without justification. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out that the paper's claims are too broad and that the results don't apply to tabular LLMs. It suggests that the authors should focus on unique characteristics. This is helpful because it guides the authors to improve their work. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't provide specific suggestions. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

It also mentions existing works and asks for details on the challenges of simulating multiple layers. The comments are explicit about the problems and suggest improvements, which is good. However, the suggestion to compare with existing methods like TailorNet isn't very detailed. It could have provided more concrete steps on how to implement this comparison or what metrics to use. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit and detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to specific works (TailorNet and Patel et al. 2021) and mentions the challenges of simulating multiple layers. It accurately points out the areas the authors should focus on, so this is fully grounded. The specificity is good because it clearly states what needs improvement and references existing literature, which helps the authors understand where to look for solutions.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that simulating multiple layers is more challenging than single layers. It supports this with existing works, which is a good justification. However, it doesn't provide concrete examples or detailed reasoning, so it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. It could benefit from more specific references or examples to strengthen the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear and raises valid points about the method's limitations and existing work. It provides suggestions for improvement, which is helpful. However, it doesn't go into depth about how to implement these suggestions or what specific changes the authors should make. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed to be fully beneficial.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is evaluated based on the given definitions and the review's content.

It seems like the authors are expressing a desire to evaluate something but not providing clear instructions. That makes it implicit because the action is inferred. Now, is it concrete?

It's pointing out a lack of explanation. Is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer isn't suggesting a specific action, just pointing out a gap. So it's implicit. Since it's implicit, it's not as actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions section 2.2 but doesn't specify what part of that section is lacking. It's vague about whether it's a figure, a method, or something else. So the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the exact issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the model's semantic similarity isn't well-explained. But it doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just a statement without justification, so it's unverifiable. That would be a score of 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a weakness but doesn't offer any suggestions or explanations to fix it. It's vague and lacks guidance.

It also suggests discussing uncertainty and providing sensitivity analysis. The comment is explicit about the issues and provides clear actions, like discussing uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. So, it's explicit and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out specific issues with the model's parameters and suggests improvements. It clearly references the model and the parameters, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is high because it directly addresses the parameters and the need for analysis. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the model's parameters are difficult to estimate. It supports this by stating that limited data and time-varying parameters make it challenging. It also suggests solutions like sensitivity analysis, which adds depth. This is thoroughly justified, so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions and is actionable.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says that the proof requires lambda not to be 0.5, but in standard mixup, lambda is usually 0.5. So, the reviewer is pointing out that the assumption might be incorrect. Now, is this an explicit action? The reviewer is making a statement about the necessity of lambda not being 0.5, which is explicit. But does it give a clear instruction on what to do? It suggests that the lambda should be different, but it doesn't specify how to adjust it or provide a solution. So, it's explicit but vague on the action. That would make it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions lambda not being 0.5 and relates it to standard mixup. They're pointing out a specific part of the paper, which is the use of lambda in mixup. They're also implying that the standard case is lambda=0.5. So, they're accurately pinpointing the section and clearly explaining the issue. That should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the assumption might be incorrect because standard mixup uses lambda=0.5. They're providing a logical reasoning by stating that in standard mixup, lambda is typically 0.5, so the proof's assumption could be off. This is supported by common knowledge about mixup's standard parameters. So, this is **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue with the proof's assumption and providing a clear rationale.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests two things. First, to highlight equations similar to the Riccati equation and second to extract inlined math into environments. The first part is explicit because it tells the author exactly which equations to look at. The second part is a bit vague because it says \"extract some of the currently inlined math,\" but it doesn't specify which ones or how. So, the action is partially explicit, but the second part is vague. According to the definition, if an action is only partially explicit, it's considered implicit. Therefore, this review is **Somewhat Actionable** because one part is clear, and the other is not detailed enough.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions \"the paragraph above Theorem 3.1\" and \"specifically on page 6.\" This clearly points to specific sections of the paper, so the grounding is strong. It doesn't just refer to a general part but specifies exact locations. Therefore, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making claims by suggesting improvements and extracting math. The suggestions are based on common knowledge about mathematical clarity and formatting. There's no external reference cited, but the reasoning is logical. So, it's somewhat justified but lacks specific examples. This would be **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions on improving equation presentation and extracting math, which directly helps the author.

So, I'd rate this as 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions comparing with a specific method from another paper. It clearly identifies the part of the paper (the method) to compare, so that's full grounding. It also specifies what needs to be compared (robustness and immunizability), which adds specificity. So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting a comparison. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's not verifiable. It just recommends adding this discussion without backing it up, which means it's unverifiable. So, the verifiability score is 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific area for improvement by comparing methods. It's clear and suggests a meaningful change. While it doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to conduct the comparison, it's still helpful because it identifies a needed improvement. So, this should be a 4 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

But is it concrete? The review doesn't specify how to create the plot or where to find data. So, it's explicit but vague. That would make it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions \"a plot of time complexity as a function of m.\" That's pretty specific. It clearly references a part of the paper (time complexity) and what needs to be done (create a plot). So, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim suggesting adding a plot. It's supported by the need to assess time complexity, which is a common knowledge point. So, it's well-justified.

The comment is asking the authors to run their own codes, which is an explicit action. However, it doesn't specify how to apply this action, like whether they need to modify the code or if there's a particular method to report the mean. So, it's explicit but vague. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is asking the authors to run their own codes, which means it's explicitly pointing to the author's own work. There's no mention of a specific part of the paper beyond that. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a particular section or figure. Therefore, it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion to run the author's own code. Since it's a claim (a suggestion), I need to check if it's supported. Running the code is a standard practice, so it's based on common knowledge. There's no external reference, but it's a logical and well-known practice.

It mentions specific models like InceptionV3 and ResNet in Table 2 but not in Table 3. The question is pretty explicit about pointing out a missing part and suggesting that the author should address it. So, the action is clear: explain the dataset differences and why certain models are included or excluded. The explanation is also concrete because it's not just a general question but specifically about the tables. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out specific tables and models, which means it's clearly addressing a specific part of the paper. The mention of tables 2 and 3 and the models within them shows that the author can pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. This is fully grounded because it's not a vague reference but a direct mention of sections. The specificity is also good because it's not just saying \"there's a problem\" but pointing out where exactly the problem is and what's missing.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about why certain models are included or excluded. It's suggesting a reason, which is a claim. The justification is that the author should address the missing results, which is a logical reasoning. However, it doesn't provide specific references or examples, so it's somewhat justified but lacks depth. Therefore, it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking a clear question about the experimental setup and pointing out a specific omission in the tables. It's providing a meaningful critique that could help the author improve their paper by addressing the missing data. While it's not the most detailed, it's still helpful because it identifies an important aspect of their methodology.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at least a 4.

Yes, it's telling the authors exactly what to do. Is it concrete? Well, it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly what should be added. So, it's explicit but not very concrete. I think this would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review is pointing out a specific part of the paper, Figure 4. So, it's clearly grounded because it's referring to a specific element. It's not making a general comment or guessing. So, grounding specificity is probably a 5 here.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim? Wait, no. It's just a request for more detail. So, it's a normal statement without a claim.

The reviewer is pointing out an issue but isn't giving a direct action like \"add a discussion\" or \"include a figure.\" Instead, they're asking the authors to explain or explore something. That's more of an implicit action. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what to do next. Maybe they should be told to add a discussion or provide more details.

It suggests more analysis for high-dimensional cases. Is this explicit? Yes, it's stating what needs to be done. Is it concrete? It tells the authors exactly where to focus their analysis. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to high-dimensional action spaces, like complex robotic manipulators. It's specific about the part of the paper, so the grounding is strong. It's not just a vague comment but points to a particular area, making it well-grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a judgment about the need for more analysis in high-dimensional spaces.

This comment is suggesting that some questions are subjective and asking for data on the percentage of errors that are subjective. It's a bit vague because it doesn't specify which part of the paper or which questions exactly. Also, it's not giving a direct action, like editing or rewriting something.

It doesn't specify whether they should look at specific parts of the model, data, or something else. So, it's explicit in asking for an explanation but lacks detail on how to do that.

The reviewer is pointing out an equivalence and suggesting improvements, which is explicit. However, the suggestion to include this analysis and discuss why TW is better is vague. It doesn't provide specific steps or how to implement this. So, it's not fully actionable because the action isn't detailed enough.

It points out that the paper omits lexically constrained decoding methods as baselines. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is directly pointing out the omission, so that's explicit. Is it concrete? The reviewer is telling the authors exactly what's missing and what they should do, which is adding those references and methods. So this is highly actionable. I think it's a 5 here.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions the related work section is lacking but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It also talks about missing references without pointing to a specific section. So the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying where the issue is. The specificity about the missing methods is clear, but since the grounding part is vague, it's not fully grounded. I'd give this a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim that the related work is lacking and suggesting adding specific methods.

It's explicit because it tells the authors to try a different method, which is a clear action. But it doesn't specify exactly what that method is or how to implement it. So, it's not very detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear, but the implementation is vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions UDA methods but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing.

It also asks whether this is due to dataset issues or method variance. The comment is suggesting an action, which is pointing out a flaw in the reliability diagrams. However, it's more of a question than a direct action. The reviewer is asking for an explanation, which is a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what to do next. Maybe they should be asked to explain why the high accuracy is in low confidence or suggest improvements.

The review refers to Fig 1, top, which is the reliability diagrams. It's specific about which part of the paper it's talking about. The comment also mentions high-accuracy spikes in low confidence, which is a specific issue. So, the grounding is pretty solid because it clearly references the figure and the specific problem. The specificity is also good because it's pointing out a particular phenomenon. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability.

It's well grounded because it's clear which part is being addressed. So, that's 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nVerifiability: The comment is a claim because it suggests that the background should be detailed. It's supported by the necessity of the information, which is common knowledge in research methods.

It explains why these comparisons are important and how they would strengthen the study. It references existing methods, making it well-supported. So, it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is very helpful. It directly addresses the authors' work, provides specific suggestions, and explains their value.

I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions collective entity linking but doesn't specify where in the paper this concept is discussed. It's a general reference without pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. The specificity is also low because it's not providing details on what needs to be addressed. I think this scores a 3 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The claim here is that the model is a special case of collective entity linking.

The reviewer asks how to design a query function for each data source and suggests removing the subscript. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does suggest specific changes, like removing the subscript, which is a clear action. However, the part about designing a query function for each data source is more of a suggestion without a specific action. So, it's partially actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the explicit part is there, but the vague part is also there.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to Algorithm 1 and mentions query functions, which are specific parts. It also suggests removing a subscript, which is a clear reference. So, the grounding is pretty solid here. The reviewer is pointing out specific issues in the algorithm, so this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment about the impact of truncating the function and suggesting a comparison. They're also asking for clarification on query functions. The first part is a claim that truncation can lower sensitivity, which needs justification. The second part is a suggestion, which doesn't require verification. So, the first part is somewhat justified, and the second isn't. I think this is \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because one part is justified, but the other isn't.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer provides specific suggestions about truncating the function and designing query functions. They also ask for a comparison, which is helpful. While it's not the most detailed, it's clear and actionable.

It says the idea isn't exciting and feels complicated. Now, is this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't suggesting a specific change. They're making a judgment about the novelty and complexity, which is a subjective opinion. So, it's an implicit action because the reviewer isn't directly telling the authors what to do; they're just critiquing the work. Therefore, it's not actionable in a direct way. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer talks about the pre-trained mechanism and few-shot graph learning. They mention the key contribution but don't specify exactly which part of the paper or what aspect they're referring to. It's a bit vague. They don't provide a unique element or a specific section, so the grounding is weak. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 2 because it's not fully grounded but not completely off either.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment about the novelty and complexity. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided to support this claim. They're just stating their opinion, so there's no verifiability. This would be a 1 since it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a concern about the novelty and complexity. While it's a valid point, they don't offer specific suggestions or improvements. They're leaving the authors to figure out what changes to make on their own. This is somewhat helpful but lacks depth.

It's explicit because it's directly asking for insight. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify what kind of insight or how to provide it. So, it's not highly actionable because the author doesn't know exactly what to do next. It's probably a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity.

The review mentions specific simulators like IsaacGym and mentions details about parameters. It's pretty specific about the simulators and the aspects of the simulators (like GPU vs CPU, substeps, vertices). So the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. That seems like full grounding because it clearly references the parts of the paper related to the simulators and their parameters.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that different simulators have different parameters affecting performance. It's providing a judgment about the need to include these details. Now, is this claim well-supported?

It's not giving explicit instructions on what to do next, like suggesting a change or a specific method. It's more of a question, which means the authors might not know how to apply this information. So, it's not very actionable. Maybe a 2 because it's implicit but vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review is referring to specific parts of the paper by mentioning the first (P \u2013 floor(t/m)) phrases and the reinforcement algorithm. It's clear which parts are being discussed, so the grounding is strong. It's fully grounded because it's pointing to specific sections, and it's specific about what's being evaluated. So, a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is asking a question about the rationale and performance. There's no claim being made, just a question. Since it's a factual statement without any justification or references, it's not verifiable. So, it's an X because there's no claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is a question, which might not provide much help to the authors. It doesn't suggest any changes or improvements, just asks about something. So, it's not very helpful. Maybe a 2 because it's somewhat relevant but lacks clarity and direction.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: X\n- Helpfulness: 2\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

The action here is pointing out a validation but not suggesting an improvement. It's more of a criticism without a clear action for the authors to take. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. Maybe they should be told to include these references or discuss them. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review refers to specific papers but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper they're talking about. It just says \"this paper\" without pinpointing the related work section or where exactly the discussion should happen. So, the grounding is weak because it's not specific about the paper's sections. I think this is a 2 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review claims that the cross-modality adaptation has been validated but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just states that they were validated without explaining why or how. So, there's no verifiability because the claim isn't supported by anything. This would be a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out that the paper didn't discuss related work but doesn't offer any suggestions on what to do about it. It's more of a criticism without providing actionable advice.

So this should be 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions Table 1 and specifically suggests adding generation results. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed, so full grounding. It also specifies what needs to be added, so it's specific. That's a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the current metric is insufficient and suggests adding another. It's not a claim that needs evidence, just a statement of opinion.

It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. Now, is it concrete? The comment doesn't specify how to conduct the experiments, like the type or the number, so it's not very detailed. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable because it tells them what to do, but not exactly how. So I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"giving some experiments\" and \"discussions on different regimes.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or which sections, so the grounding is weak. The comment refers to the paper in a general sense without pointing to a specific section or figure. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 2 because it's not fully grounded but it's not weak either.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a claim by suggesting experiments. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so there's no supporting evidence. It's just a suggestion without any backing, so verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is clear about what the authors should do and why it's important. It's pointing out a weakness in the theory by suggesting empirical validation, which is helpful.

The comment suggests a change in the function but doesn't tell the authors what to do next.

It mentions the functions (3) and (2) but doesn't specify the exact section or figure. It's a bit vague because it doesn't pinpoint the exact issue.

However, they don't provide specific instructions on what to do next, like suggesting a change or a specific fix. So, it's not fully actionable because the next steps aren't detailed. Maybe they could say something like, \"You might want to clarify how multiple graphs are integrated\" or \"Consider discussing the impact of different edge weights.\" Without that, it's more of a hint than a clear action plan. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer refers to line 180 and mentions edge weights. They pinpoint a specific part of the paper, which is good. They also ask about the number of parameters, which is a clear indication of what needs to be addressed. So, they're fully grounding the comment and clearly specifying the issue. This should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the method is straightforward and points out a lack of clarity. They don't provide external references or logical reasoning to back up their claims. It's more of an opinion without justification. So, this is **1: Unverifiable** because there's no supporting evidence or reasoning.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer's comments are pointing out a lack of clarity and suggesting areas for improvement, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are quite vague. They ask about line 180 and edge weights but don't offer specific fixes or alternative approaches. This makes the feedback somewhat useful but not entirely helpful. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does address issues but lacks depth in suggestions.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests adding a more complex manifold example. The comment is explicit about the limitation (limited scope) and provides an explicit action (adding a more complex example). It also gives a clear direction on how to implement this (learning geometry of a more complicated manifold). So, this is both explicit and concrete. Therefore, it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out that the experiments are limited to specific examples. It mentions unit spheres, spiral curves, and taxi travel. This is a clear mention of specific parts of the paper, so the grounding is full. Additionally, it explains what's missing (a more complex manifold) which adds specificity. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the experiments being limited in scope. It suggests adding a more complex example, which is a claim. The justification is that a more complex example would provide better understanding of the geometry. This is logical reasoning and common knowledge about the need for diverse examples. So, it's thoroughly supported, making it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear feedback on the experimental limitations and suggests a specific improvement.

It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving a clear action. It's more of a statement pointing out a problem without suggesting a fix. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at a problem but doesn't specify how to address it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions the number of baselines is small but doesn't specify which part of the paper or why it's an issue. It's vague about what needs to be addressed. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment states that the number of baselines is small, which is a claim.

It's pointing out a lack of detail. Now, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The comment here is pointing out a missing piece but doesn't suggest what to do next. It's more of a statement than an action. So, it's not explicit or actionable. It doesn't provide clear steps or fixes, so it's probably not highly actionable. Maybe it's borderline because it's pointing out an issue but not giving a solution. So, I'd rate this as 2 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review talks about tokenizer training but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where the information should be applied. It's a general statement about the lack of details. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed. It's more of a general critique without pinpointing the issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that there's no information about tokenizer training. It's a subjective opinion, so it's a claim. Now, is this claim supported? The review references a specific citation [4], which suggests that the claim is somewhat justified.

The review mentions that the authors' framework is more complex than a simple multi-view contrastive objective and asks if the added complexity is justified. It also points out that the contributions are co-training, positive mining, and alternate optimization. Now, for actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do next. The review suggests that the framework is intuitive and the results are good, but it doesn't specify what changes are needed. It's more of a question than a directive. So, it's not explicit or implicit because it's not telling them exactly what to do, just asking. It's also not concrete because it doesn't explain how to make the comparison or what metrics to use. So, this seems like it's borderline actionable because it does imply an action (comparing their method to a simpler one) but doesn't give specifics on how to do it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to [A] as a reference, but it doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It talks about the framework's complexity and whether it's warranted, but it doesn't point to a specific section or figure in the authors' paper. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinning down exactly where the issue lies. It's making a general comment without clearly identifying the referenced part.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review makes a claim that the additional complexity is not clear if the contributions are necessary. It references [A], which is a specific work, so that's an external reference. The reasoning is that the framework is more complex, but without justification on why it's better. It's somewhat justified because it cites another work, but it doesn't explain how [A] is different or why the added steps are necessary. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a reference, but the reasoning is vague.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is asking whether the added complexity is warranted and is pointing out that the contributions are specific steps. It's not giving clear suggestions on how to improve or what changes to make. It's more of a discussion than a helpful critique.

I think this is somewhat actionable because it points out a specific area to improve, even if it's not detailed.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about the sample size in Section 6.2. It doesn't mention a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is weak.

It suggests exploring healthcare applications. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a limitation and giving a suggestion, so that's explicit. Is it concrete? The reviewer mentions specific areas like healthcare, so the authors know exactly where to focus. So this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions medical diagnosis as a specific area. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed\u2014the applications section, perhaps. The comment is specific about the type of application, so this is fully grounded and specific. That's a 5.\n\nVerifiability. The review is making a claim that the research is limited to the knapsack problem and suggests exploring healthcare. It's providing reasoning by mentioning the impact and relevance. It's logical and well-supported by common knowledge about the importance of diverse applications. So this is fully verifiable, a 5.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review clearly identifies a weakness and provides actionable suggestions. It's not vague; it's specific about the areas to explore.

It also points out that in Figure 3, the new method is noisier in two domains and equally noisy elsewhere. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out specific issues in the method and Figure 3. That seems explicit because they're directly talking about the method's performance. Now, is it concrete? They mention specific domains where it's noisier and others where it's equally noisy. So the reviewer is giving clear details on how the method performs, which makes it concrete. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to the method's performance in specific domains mentioned in Figure 3. They're not just talking about Figure 3 in general but about specific areas where the new method underperforms. This means the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the part of the paper being discussed, which is full grounding. Additionally, they're clearly specifying what's wrong, so it's specific. Therefore, this should also be a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is making a claim that the method doesn't improve on certain aspects and points to Figure 3 as evidence. They're not just stating facts; they're providing a judgment about the method's performance. Now, is this claim well-supported? They reference Figure 3, which is a specific part of the paper, and they describe the performance metrics. This provides logical reasoning and specific examples, so the claim is fully verifiable. Hence, verifiability should be a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out clear weaknesses and suggesting improvements. It's specific about where the method underperforms, which is helpful for the authors. The suggestions are actionable, and the feedback is focused on improving the method's performance. This makes the review highly helpful.

The review says, \"Does this conclusion hold against more sophisticated or more aggressive removal methods?\" I think this is asking the authors to consider alternative methods, which is a good action. But is it explicit? Yes, it's a direct question, so that's explicit. Is it concrete? Well, it's a yes/no question, but it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. So maybe it's not fully concrete. I'm leaning towards 3: Somewhat Actionable because it's clear but lacks specific guidance on how to test the conclusion.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is asking about more sophisticated methods, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs to be addressed. It's a bit vague. So I think this is weakly grounded because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded since it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or figure.\n\nVerifiability.

It suggests they should add this information. This is explicit, so it's actionable. The suggestion is clear, so it's not implicit. It's also concrete because it tells the authors exactly what to do. So, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out specific issues related to the paper's content. It mentions the lack of explanation of interpretability and the difference between the two concepts. It doesn't just say \"the paper is lacking something\" but specifically identifies what's missing. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed. So, this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that the authors didn't explain interpretability and didn't provide work in this area.

The reviewer does suggest improvements, like checking the differentiability of g and mentioning the limitation of reverse KL. However, they don't explicitly tell the authors how to implement these changes or what specific parts of their model to adjust. So it's more of an implicit suggestion.

The review refers to the reverse KL being mode-seeking and suggests that it's a limitation. It also mentions recent work on normalizing flows. The grounding here is pretty specific because it directly references the mode-seeking property and recent literature. The reviewer is pointing out specific issues related to the method used. So this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer provides some justification. They explain why reverse KL is mode-seeking and suggest looking into recent work. However, the explanation is a bit vague.

Is this explicit or implicit? It seems like it's a yes/no question, so it's explicit. But does it give any actionable suggestion? No, it's just a question. So it's not very actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. Maybe they tried it, maybe they didn't, but there's no guidance on what to do if they have. So I'd rate this as 2: Borderline Actionable because it's somewhat explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions TF-IDF and dense retrieval. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or where these methods are applied. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint which section or figure they should look at. So this is weak grounding because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion to try a method.

It's explicit about pointing out areas for improvement, so that's good. However, it's vague on how to implement these suggestions. For instance, it doesn't specify how to analyze the correlation between countries or how to relate trajectories to eigenvectors. So, while the action is clear, the details are missing, making it somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific countries (UK and Russia) and a particular dataset (COVID-19).

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that learned prompts are specific to architectures like CLIP or DINOv2 and might not work well with others. It suggests exploring more universal features or optimizing prompts independently. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The review does give a clear direction to explore more universal features, which is explicit. It also provides some guidance on how to do that, like optimizing independently. So, it's not just stating a problem but also giving a path to solve it. That seems pretty actionable. I think this is a 5 because it's explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review talks about specific architectures but then suggests a more universal approach. It mentions \"more universal features\" and \"optimizing independently of model architecture.\" This clearly identifies the part of the paper it's addressing\u2014specifically, the limitations of current architectures and the need for a universal solution. So, it's fully grounded because it pinpoints the issue and suggests a solution. The specificity is high because it's not just pointing out a problem but also hinting at a solution. I'd give this a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that prompts are specific to architectures and might not generalize. It then suggests exploring universal features, which is a claim requiring justification. The justification here is a bit vague\u2014it says \"it would be beneficial to explore if and how prompts could be designed with more universal features or optimized independently of model architecture.\" While it's a claim, the justification is a bit general. It doesn't provide specific references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I think this would be a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a limitation and suggesting a solution, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, providing a direction for improvement. However, it's somewhat narrow in scope because it's focused on prompt customization across architectures. It doesn't cover other areas like model efficiency or training methods.

The second is whether the method can be applied to different domains. The first question is explicit because it directly asks about the comparison, which is actionable. The second question is also explicit but doesn't give a specific action, just a request for application.

I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the first part is clear, but the second is vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review point is asking about the method's applicability. It doesn't mention a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is weak. It's not pointing to a particular section or figure, just asking in general. Therefore, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review point is making a claim by asking if the method can be applied elsewhere. However, it's a question without any supporting evidence or justification. It's just a request, so it's not verifiable.

They suggest evaluating it with other GNN blocks like GAT, GraphSAGE, etc. The comment is explicit about the action of evaluating under different GNN blocks, so that's an explicit action. It also provides concrete details on which specific GNN blocks to test. So, this is both explicit and concrete. I think this should be highly actionable because it gives clear next steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions specific GNN blocks, so it's clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's not just a general statement but specifically refers to different architectures. Therefore, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections being discussed. The specificity is also good because it details which models to test, making it clear what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the framework is model-agnostic but only tested under GCN. It suggests evaluating under other GNNs. The justification is provided by mentioning specific models, which adds verifiability. It's logical and provides examples, so it's thoroughly supported.

The action here is clear: include specific metrics. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. Also, it's concrete because it provides specific scores, so the authors know exactly how to apply this. So that's a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to NF-Rev{GRU, LSTM} and specifically mentions perplexity/BLEU scores. It's explicit about the model type and the metrics, so it's fully grounded. It also clearly specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the necessity of the gating mechanism. So that's a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nVerifiability. The review contains a claim that including these scores would be useful. It's supported by logical reasoning\u2014using common knowledge about metrics like perplexity and BLEU to evaluate model effectiveness. There's no mention of external references, but the reasoning is solid and logical. So this is a 4 because it's mostly verifiable with some minor gaps.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness.

It directly states that there's no error analysis, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It mentions the absence but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They might need to add an error analysis themselves. So it's explicit but not concrete. That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It just says \"no mention of an error analysis.\" So the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. That's weak grounding because it's an educated guess without specifics. So grounding_specificity would be 2.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that SetCSE lacks error analysis. Is this supported? Well, it's a statement without evidence or references. It's an opinion or suggestion, so it's a claim. But there's no justification or references provided. So it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a limitation but doesn't provide specific advice on how to improve it. The authors still have to figure out what to do next. It's somewhat helpful but not fully because it lacks concrete suggestions.

The review talks about MuJoCo tasks and suggests finding other tasks. It doesn't mention specific sections of the paper, like figures or tables, but it does refer to the type of tasks. It's a bit vague because it doesn't pinpoint a specific part of the paper. However, it does clearly state what needs to be addressed, which is the lack of effectiveness in MuJoCo. So, it's grounded because it refers to a specific type of task, even if not a specific section. I think this is a 4 because it's grounded but not super specific about the part of the paper.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that marginal improvement doesn't mean ineffectiveness and suggests trying other tasks.

The comment is asking the authors to check Table A3 and suggests organizing the data into separate tables and adding glosses. It's pretty explicit about what needs to be done, so that's explicit action. Now, is it concrete? The suggestion is to organize and add glosses, which are specific actions.

The comment here suggests using evaluation benchmarks, but it's quite vague. It doesn't specify what needs to be done or how to implement it. So, it's not explicit enough. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.

Second, in Table 5, \"from-scratch\" is reported, and the authors are unsure if it's pre-trained or randomly initialized. The review provides clear suggestions for both issues, like adding an explanation and clarifying the model setup. These are direct actions the authors can take, and the suggestions are concrete. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review specifically points out issues in Table 1 and Table 5. It mentions exact sections and terms like \"from-scratch\" and \"pre-trained.\" The authors are asked to clarify these parts, which means the review is well-grounded because it accurately references the relevant sections of the paper. The specificity is good because it clearly states what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains claims about the missing explanation and the unclear model initialization. These claims are supported by logical reasoning. For example, pointing out that the star (*) is unclear and that \"from-scratch\" might imply no pre-training. The authors are asked to clarify or provide more details, which is a logical justification. There's no mention of external references, but the reasoning is solid, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review addresses two distinct issues, each with a clear suggestion. It's specific about where the problems are and what needs to be done. The suggestions are actionable and provide enough guidance for the authors to improve their work. This makes the review quite helpful, though it could be slightly expanded for completeness.

It's explicit because it tells the author exactly where to put the information. But is it concrete? It says \"highlight,\" which is a bit vague. The author might not know exactly how to phrase it or where to place it. So, it's not fully actionable because the method of highlighting isn't specified. Maybe it's borderline actionable since it's clear the author needs to do something but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions the covariance spectrum, which is specific. The author can pinpoint exactly where in the results to highlight this. So, this is fully grounded because it clearly references a specific part of the paper. The specificity is high because it's about a particular aspect of the results.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim suggesting the author should highlight something. It's not a fact, so it's a claim. The justification is vague\u2014it just says \"highlight\" without explaining why or how. There's no reference to external literature or logical reasoning, so it's not well-verified. It's borderline verifiable because it's a claim but lacks supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment advises the author to highlight a specific aspect but doesn't provide much detail. It's clear the author needs to make the results more data-dependent, but without specifics, the feedback is somewhat helpful. It's not fully helpful because it doesn't guide the author on how to implement the change.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: 2 (Borderline Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It's clear which part of the paper it's referring to, so that's fully grounded. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the definition of RMSD, so that's specific. This should be a 5 because it's both grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment about the ambiguity of RMSD and suggesting clarification. This is a claim, and it's supported by common knowledge about RMSD being a measure of RMSD between structures.

It's asking whether a certain type of regret scaling (smooth) could still hold the proven bounds. This requires justification, but the justification isn't provided.

This is another explicit action. The reviewer also mentions that the performance in a supervised setting doesn't validate another method, which is a clear suggestion on how to apply the comparison. So, the actions are explicit, and the details are provided, making it actionable.

It does identify specific parts of the paper (the title and the text), so that's full grounding.

I'd give this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the papers' assumptions and suggests a specific concept. It's supported by logical reasoning about the strength of the assumptions. There's no external reference, but the logic is clear. So, it's somewhat verifiable. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out a specific issue with the papers' assumptions and suggests a concept to refer to. It's clear and provides a direction for improvement. It's helpful but could be more detailed.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the method relies on influence functions but points out a limitation when weights are far from zero. It suggests that the influence function might not be reliable in such cases. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The review does explain the limitation, so that's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to fix it or what to do? It just points out the issue without providing a solution. So, it's explicit but vague. I think this would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear that there's a problem but doesn't give detailed steps on how to address it.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review talks about the influence function's validity when weights are near zero. It mentions the Taylor's first-order expansion, which implies a specific part of the paper. The grounding is clear because it refers to the method's reliance on influence functions and the specific condition about weights. So, the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. The specificity is also good because it explains what the problem is. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the influence function's approximation isn't valid when weights are far from zero. It supports this with a logical explanation about Taylor's expansion. It doesn't cite external references, but the reasoning is solid. So, it's **4: Mostly Verifiable** because it's well-supported but could use more examples or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review identifies a limitation of the method and explains why it's a problem. It gives some guidance on when the method might fail, which is helpful for the authors. However, it doesn't suggest alternative methods or how to modify the current approach. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most comprehensive. I'd rate this a **4: Mostly Helpful** because it addresses an important point and provides some actionable insights, though it could be expanded.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding: 5\n- Verifiability: 4\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It also adds an aside about their current experiment with missing points. The explicit action is to address the issue, which is clear. However, the aside about the ground-truth center being provided is more of an opinion and doesn't provide a direct action. So, it's partially actionable. I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because the main action is explicit, but the additional comment is vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to centering for complete shapes but points out the issue with partial ones. It doesn't explicitly name the section or part of the paper, just mentions it in a general way. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific part. The specificity about partial shapes is clear, but since the grounding isn't specific, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific**? Wait, no. The grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part, but the specificity about the issue is clear. Hmm, maybe it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does specify the issue but doesn't clearly identify the part. Or perhaps it's **Fully Grounded and Specific** if it's clear where the problem is. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's not clearly identifying the part but does mention the issue clearly.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that centering isn't well-defined for partial shapes. It provides an aside about their experiment, which is an opinion but not a justification. So, the claim is made but not well-supported. It's **Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some justification but lacks key elements like references or examples.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers a clear suggestion to address the issue but also adds an opinion about their current experiment. The main suggestion is helpful, but the additional opinion doesn't add much value. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful** because it provides meaningful feedback but could be more focused.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For grounding specificity, the main point is about partial shapes, so it's specific about the issue but not the part. So maybe it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific**. For verifiability, the claim is made but only with an opinion, so it's **Somewhat Verifiable**. Actionability is explicit but with a vague aside, so **Somewhat Actionable**.

It suggests the work is incomplete and that the paper doesn't explain the model specifics well. It also points out limited related work and no analysis. Now, for actionability, it's about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The review does suggest improvements but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be added or changed. It's vague on the actions, so it's not fully actionable. Therefore, it's probably **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about the contribution being insufficient and mentions related work but doesn't pin down exactly where the issues are. It refers to the paper as incomplete but doesn't specify which part. So, the grounding is weak because it can't confidently identify the referenced part. It's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the work's contribution is insufficient and lacks related work analysis. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement without justification, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is critical but lacks specific suggestions. It points out problems but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. This makes it somewhat helpful but not very useful. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It also points out that Figure 2a should include these details. This is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors what to do. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to apply this change or what data to use. So, it's not fully actionable. I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to Figures 2a and 2b but doesn't clearly identify which specific part of the paper these figures relate to. It mentions \"training steps\" without being specific about what aspect of the training process. It also doesn't provide clear details about what's missing in the figures.

It's a bit vague. The author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. So this is weak grounding because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. Maybe it's fully grounded if it mentions devices, but since it's unclear, I think it's weakly grounded. Also, it doesn't specify what needs to be addressed, so it's not specific.

The review says that LLaVA-series and Qwen-VL aren't included because they're commonly adopted LVLMs. The reviewer suggests including them for a more comprehensive comparison. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The reviewer is pointing out a reason for exclusion but doesn't specify what to do next. They're making a recommendation but not giving a clear action. So, it's not explicit; it's more of an implied suggestion. Therefore, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under borderline actionable because the action is there but vague.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions excluding specific models but doesn't pin down which part of the paper it's addressing. It's talking about the models in general, not a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's more of a general statement without specifics.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a judgment that these models are commonly adopted. They're suggesting including them for comparison. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is stating a fact that these models are commonly used, which is a general knowledge point. So, it's somewhat justified but lacks specific references or examples. It's not fully verifiable because it's based on common knowledge without concrete evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is making a suggestion but doesn't provide detailed reasoning or examples. They're pointing out a limitation but not explaining why it's a problem or how it affects the evaluation. The suggestion is there, but it's vague and lacks depth. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully because it doesn't address the impact or provide a clear benefit to the authors.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the definitions provided.

It suggests specific numbers, which is explicit. Then, it tells the authors to follow those settings. The action is clear: modify their prediction lengths. The details are concrete, so it's actionable. That should be a 5.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions specific prediction lengths and connects them to the original dataset. It's not just a general statement; it's pointing out a specific issue. So the grounding is full because it accurately identifies the part of the paper. Specificity is also good because it clearly states what needs to be changed. So this should be a 5.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a judgment that the current settings are incorrect and suggests new ones. It doesn't provide any external references or reasoning, just a suggestion. So it's a claim without support, making it unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nHelpfulness. The review points out a specific issue and gives clear suggestions. It's helpful because it guides the authors on what changes to make. It's somewhat specific but doesn't go into why the current settings are wrong or how to evaluate them.

It's suggesting that the difference isn't reasonable. Is this an explicit action? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a problem, but it's more of a critique rather than a direct instruction on how to fix it. So, it's not giving an explicit action. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it's implicit but vague. I think it's a 2 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment mentions \"one sample\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's unclear which section or figure they're talking about. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. It's not fully grounded.

The review points to section 371 and mentions partitions. The mention of section 371 is explicit, so the grounding is strong. However, the reviewer also talks about a threshold, which isn't a specific part of the paper. The specificity regarding the threshold is unclear. So, while the grounding is good, the specificity is lacking because not everything mentioned is clearly detailed. This would fall under weak grounding and not specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment suggests that the partitions were done randomly. This is a claim because it's an opinion or judgment about the methodology. The justification provided is vague\u2014it just states that the reviewer doubts the randomness without giving any references or logical reasoning.

The comment says GNN is mentioned at the end of page 1 but the definition is in Section 2. It doesn't explicitly name the section or page, so the authors have to infer where to add the definition.

It also states that the effectiveness of the proposed loss function on such algorithms doesn't guarantee effectiveness on top-performing ones. This provides clear guidance for improvement, so it's explicit and concrete. Therefore, it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the DAVIS dataset and cites a specific paper.

So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit question, which means the authors still don't know exactly what to do.

They just state the claim without pinning down the exact section or element. So, this is **weak grounding** because the reviewer can't confidently identify the exact part, but they do reference a specific section. Since they don't provide more detail, it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim about the upsampled feature map's semantics being stronger. They don't provide any justification or references. This is a **claim extraction** because they're making a judgment about the paper. But without any supporting evidence, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing for the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is clear and points out a specific area the author needs to understand. However, since they don't explain what they mean by \"stronger,\" the author still needs to figure it out on their own. This provides some direction but lacks depth. So, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify an issue but doesn't fully guide the author on how to improve it.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

To verify this, the reviewer would need to check the paper for implementation details. If the paper doesn't have them, then the claim is supported. However, the justification is vague because it doesn't specify where to look or what exactly is missing. So it's somewhat verifiable, which I'll rate as 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a lack of detail, which is helpful. It guides the authors to look elsewhere for implementation specifics. It's not vague; it's clear about what's missing.

It suggests providing a thorough description. The comment is explicit about the missing information and provides a clear action\u2014providing the details. It doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement it, though, so it's not fully actionable. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out missing details about RAMP, comparisons, discretization, etc. It accurately mentions each of these areas, so it's fully grounded. It also clearly specifies what's missing, so it's specific. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment contains a claim that the missing details make results un reproducible and comparisons difficult. It provides some reasoning about the impact on significance but doesn't cite external references or logical reasoning beyond general statements. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth. So, I'd give it a **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issues and suggests improvements. It's pointing out critical points that would help authors enhance their work, so it's quite helpful. It doesn't seem vague or lacking in guidance, so I'd rate this as **5: Highly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It also says the application in text detection is new but not groundbreaking. The action here is pointing out that the idea isn't new, but it's vague on what the authors should do. They don't get specific instructions on how to implement MoE or where to start. So, it's not actionable because the authors still have to figure out the next steps on their own. I think this is a 1 for unactionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about various tasks like LLM, summarization, and machine translation, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's too general. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue lies, so the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly reference the paper's specific section or issue. So, this is a 2 for weak grounding and not specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that MoE isn't groundbreaking because it's used elsewhere. It's making a claim that the concept isn't new, but it's not supported by specific references or examples. There's no clear justification or evidence provided, so it's not verifiable. This would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers some insight that the concept isn't new, which is helpful. However, it's vague and doesn't provide concrete suggestions or actionable steps. The authors still have to figure out how to apply this information. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully.

It suggests adding one. Is this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors exactly what to do. Is it concrete? It specifies adding a statistical analysis, so authors know exactly how to apply it. So this should be 5: Highly Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions that SpaceTGN outperforms other methods but doesn't specify which part of the paper. It doesn't mention sections, tables, or figures. It's a general comment without pointing to a specific area. So the grounding is weak because it can't be precisely identified. The specificity about the statistical analysis is good, but since the main point is general, it's not fully grounded. So this would be 3: Somewhat Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that SpaceTGN is better but lacks supporting evidence. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning. So the claim is unsupported, making it unverifiable. The score here is 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review suggests adding a statistical analysis but doesn't explain why it's necessary or how it helps. It's vague and lacks depth.

However, the comment doesn't specify what needs to be done, like suggesting a change or explaining why the scores are in that way. It's vague because it doesn't provide explicit instructions or actions for the authors. So, this is more of an implicit action, which might be considered actionable but not very explicit. Since it's vague, it might not be highly actionable. I think this falls under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does mention an action (pointing out confusion) but doesn't give clear details on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment doesn't specify which part of the paper is causing confusion. It just says \"this may cause confusion\" without pointing to a specific section or table. Therefore, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. The comment doesn't provide enough detail about what needs to be addressed, so it's not fully grounded. This would be **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** since it doesn't clearly identify the problematic part.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claim or suggestion.

The review does suggest that the authors should provide more details on the uniqueness of consistency models, which is an explicit action. However, it doesn't specify exactly what the authors should do, like how to compare consistency models to others or what specific aspects to highlight. So, it's not entirely concrete.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point is suggesting that the authors should show whether learning the advantage directly is useful. It mentions that while they've made a case for the advantage being a quantity of interest, there's little evidence in the paper comparing their method to others. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the comment is asking the authors to provide evidence. It's not giving a specific action like \"add a figure\" or \"run experiments on dataset X.\" So, it's more of a suggestion rather than an explicit action. Therefore, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what evidence to provide. So, on a scale of 1 to 5, I'd rate this as 2 because it's borderline actionable\u2014it does suggest something but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is about comparing their method to others, but it doesn't specify which methods or where to look. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly which external work to reference or what specific aspect of their method to highlight. So, the grounding isn't very specific because it doesn't clearly point to a particular part of the paper or a specific issue. It's more of a general suggestion, so I'd rate this as 3. It's weakly grounded because it could be inferred, but it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or method.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that their method is important compared to others. It needs evidence, so the authors would need to justify why this comparison is necessary. The justification is present but could be more robust, like citing specific results or providing logical reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd rate this as 4 because it's mostly supported but has minor gaps.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out a gap in the paper and suggesting a comparison, which is useful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide concrete steps or evidence. The authors might not know how to proceed, so while it's helpful, it's not the most helpful. I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the definitions provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It's explicit because it directly tells the authors what to do. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to explain the variables. The authors might not know which parts of the algorithms to focus on or how detailed the explanations should be. So, this is borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions variables like \u03c2 and r_i but doesn't specify which part of the paper or algorithm they are in. It's unclear where these variables are used, so the grounding is weak. The comment doesn't clearly identify the referenced part, making it not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting that the explanations are needed. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why these variables should be explained. There's no reference to common knowledge or external sources, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and provides a reason for the authors to improve their work. It's actionable in that it tells them what to do, though not how. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies an improvement area, but it's not fully comprehensive.\n\nSo, based on these evaluations, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding_specificity: 1 (Not Grounded)\n- Verifiability: 1 (Unverifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It's pointing out a problem but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. So, it's not explicit or direct. It's more of an implication. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to fix it. I'd give it a 1 for unactionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about the method lacking innovation and being incremental. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or method is affected. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. That means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part.

It doesn't just say \"compare,\" it gives a clear idea of what to compare. So, the grounding is strong because it points to specific parts of the paper or unique aspects. That would be a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a suggestion, which is a claim. It's asking the authors to perform a comparative analysis, which is a logical request. There's no external reference or examples given, but the reasoning is clear. So, it's somewhat verifiable. That would be a 4 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is suggesting a significant improvement by adding a comparative analysis.

It suggests that this limits its practical usefulness. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a problem, but they don't specify exactly what needs to be changed. So, it's implicit. Next, is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't tell the authors exactly how to improve PH-GDN_C. They just say it's not performing well. So, it's not concrete.

The comment suggests an action, which is pointing out the unfair comparison, but it's vague on how to fix it. So, it's not explicit enough. It's more of an implicit action, so I think it's **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does state an action but doesn't give details on how to proceed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions offline RL algorithms and their target of finding an equilibrium. It accurately points out that the comparison is unfair because of this. So, it's fully grounded because it references a specific part of the paper (offline RL algorithms) and explains why the comparison is problematic. It's also specific because it clearly states the issue.

It also recommends more detailed comparisons. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out areas that have been covered before but suggests the paper needs to do more. That sounds like an explicit action because they're directly telling the authors what needs to be done. But is it concrete? They don't specify exactly what to add or how to compare.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the paper lacks quantitative results but provides qualitative ones. It suggests the approach is novel and effective, but the limited impact is a concern. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a direct action. They're making a judgment about the effectiveness based on limited data. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implied suggestion. Therefore, it's **Implicit**. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how to add quantitative results or what kind of experiments to conduct. So, it's not concrete either. Since it's implicit and vague, it falls under **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about the Human Shape Bases Synchronization problem and mentions the lack of quantitative results. They do specify which part of the paper is lacking data, so that's good grounding. They also explain why it's an issue, which adds specificity. So, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer states that the paper is borderline and leans towards acceptance. They provide a judgment about the effectiveness but don't back it up with external references or logical reasoning. It's a subjective opinion without strong justification. So, this is **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer offers some feedback but it's quite vague. They suggest the paper is novel and effective but point out a limitation. However, they don't provide clear actionable steps or specific suggestions for improvement. This makes the feedback somewhat helpful but not very detailed. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Borderline Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Unverifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

The review says, \"Why is this paper categorized under Fairness/Accountability/Transparency, am I missing something?\" The reviewer is asking for clarification. Is this an explicit action? Well, the reviewer is seeking an explanation, which is a form of action, but it's more of a question than a directive. So, it's not giving a clear instruction on what to do. It's more of a question, so I think it's borderline actionable because it's asking for an explanation, but it's vague. Maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is asking about a specific category but isn't pinpointing which part of the paper. They're just asking in general. So, the grounding is weak because they're not pointing to a specific section or issue. They're making a general comment, so grounding_specificity would be low, maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is asking a question without providing any justification or evidence. They're just asking why the paper is categorized that way. There's no claim here, so it's an X for verifiability because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nHelpfulness. The reviewer is asking a question that's not very helpful.

It mentions the need to exploit modality-missing data but doesn't give concrete steps. So, it's not explicit or detailed. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which makes it somewhat actionable but vague.

The review mentions specific SOTA methods like Ma et al. (2021b) and others, which clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed. It also explains why comparing with these is important, which adds specificity. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific\" because it accurately points to the sections and explains the issue clearly.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that the authors' claim about not exploiting modality-missing data isn't justified. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It just states that the comparison should include SOTA methods but doesn't back up the original claim. So, this is \"Unverifiable\" because there's no justification or evidence given to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

It suggests removing this part. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The comment is explicit because it clearly states that the discussion is confusing and suggests removing it. But is it concrete? It tells the authors what to do but doesn't specify how to do it, like whether to remove all such discussions or just some. So, it's explicit but not very concrete. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done, but lacks detail on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to \"opinion holder\" and \"opinion targets\" without specifying which part of the paper.

The comment doesn't provide enough context for the authors to pinpoint the issue, making it weakly grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the discussion is confusing and that certain terms aren't relevant.

It suggests that without this info, it's hard to judge the benefit of enforcing equivariance. The comment is explicit about the issue (deeper network) and provides a clear action (requesting parameter count). So, it's explicit and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out a specific part of the paper\u2014the group CapNet's depth and parameters. It's clearly referencing a particular section, so the grounding is full. It also explains why the number of parameters matters, which adds specificity. So, this should be a 5 here too.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the deeper network's parameters are needed to assess the benefit. It doesn't provide external references or detailed reasoning, but it's clear and logical. So, it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 4.

The reviewer is pointing out previous work but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They mention alternatives but don't provide clear steps or modifications the authors should make. So, it's implicit. Also, the suggestions are vague about how to implement the efficient methods. Therefore, it's not very actionable. I'd rate this as 2: Borderline Actionable because it does suggest something but lacks specific guidance.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to DiME, FastDiME, and He et al.'s work. It mentions \"various approaches\" and \"more efficient implementations.\" However, it doesn't clearly identify which specific part of the paper the authors are addressing.

It suggests adding legends and explaining what each data point is. Explicitly, it tells the authors to add legends, which is a clear action. It also gives a direct instruction on what to include, so it's not just a vague suggestion. Therefore, this is highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to do and how to apply it.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Figure 4 specifically, so the grounding is strong. It's not just a general comment but directly addressing a part of the paper. Additionally, it specifies what needs to be addressed\u2014adding legends and explanations. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the figure is hard to interpret without legends. It suggests improvements, which is a claim. The justification is that adding legends would make it clearer, which is a logical reasoning. There's no external reference needed here, but the reasoning is solid and clear.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review point is asking if the paper is concerned with sequence-to-sequence models and mentions that a general quantization strategy can be applied to other models. It also asks if there's something specific about the robustness-aware quantization for seq2seq models. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is asking specific questions, which is good. They're not just making a broad statement but are seeking clarification on whether the paper focuses on seq2seq and if their method is unique to that model. So, this is explicit because they're directly asking for information. It's not just a vague suggestion but a clear question. So, I think this is 4: Mostly Actionable because while the action is clear, it might not be entirely concrete on how to apply the answer. But since they're just asking for confirmation, it's mostly actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer is asking about sequence-to-sequence models, which is specific. They're not just talking about models in general but about a particular type. So, they're accurately pinpointing the section of the paper. Then, they're asking if there's something specific about their method for seq2seq models, which is also specific. So, they're fully grounded because they're clearly addressing a specific part of the paper. The specificity is also good because they're not just making a general statement but are asking about a particular aspect. So, this should be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is making a claim by asking if the paper is concerned with seq2seq models and if their method is specific to them. They're not just stating facts; they're making judgments about the paper's focus and their method's uniqueness. Now, for verifiability, we need to see if this claim is supported. The reviewer isn't providing any evidence or references, just asking questions. So, the claim is there, but there's no justification or support. Therefore, it's 2: Borderline Verifiable because there's some support (the questions) but it's vague and lacks details.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer is asking two specific questions: one about the paper's focus on seq2seq models and another about the uniqueness of their method. These are clear and actionable, but they don't provide detailed suggestions or guidance. They're more of a probing nature rather than constructive feedback. So, while they're helpful in pointing out areas for the authors to consider, they don't offer much in terms of actionable advice beyond asking questions. Therefore, this should be 3: Somewhat Helpful because it does identify areas but doesn't go far enough in providing detailed suggestions.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be:\n- Actionability: 4\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 2\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions lambda in Algorithm 2 but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section to focus on. It's a bit vague. So the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the ablation should occur.

However, it's somewhat vague on how to conduct the ablation, so it's **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The review is clear about what to do but lacks specifics on implementation, so actionability is somewhat actionable. Grounding is weak because it doesn't specify the section.

The review does suggest specific issues, like the lack of detail on the hidden units and the bias from treating unobserved ratings as zeros. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do to fix these issues. It's more of a critique without clear, actionable steps. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to infer how to address these points.

It says to remove known equations but doesn't specify how to identify them or what to replace them with. So it's explicit but not very concrete. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions Section 3.2 but doesn't specify which equations or parts are being referred to. It just says \"many equations are NOT proposed by this work, but are well-known in the community already.\" So the authors have to infer which equations are being discussed. This is weak grounding because it's not pointing to a specific part of the paper. They might have to look through the section to find the equations, which isn't ideal. So I'd rate this as \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\"\n\nFor verifiability, the review suggests shortening Section 3.2 because the equations are well-known. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's just a statement based on the community's knowledge, which might not be sufficient. So this is \"Unverifiable\" because there's no justification or evidence provided to support the claim.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review offers a suggestion to shorten the section, which is helpful. It points out redundancy and suggests an improvement. However, it's quite brief and doesn't elaborate on why shortening is beneficial or how it affects the overall paper. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Helpful.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Unverifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point says, \"In Figure 3, Table 3, and Figure 5, which evaluation method used between automatic and human evaluation?\" It's asking the authors to identify which method was used for specific figures and tables. This is more of a factual question rather than a suggestion for improvement. There's no explicit instruction on what needs to be changed or how to proceed. So, it's not providing actionable steps. Therefore, it's **Unactionable** with a score of 1.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points to specific figures and tables (Figure 3, Table 3, Figure 5) but doesn't explain why these were chosen or what the issue is with them. It's making a statement without providing clear grounding. So, the grounding is weak because it can't confidently identify the referenced parts. The score here is **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** with a 2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is stating a fact: which evaluation method was used. There's no claim or suggestion made, just a statement. Since it's a factual statement without any justification or references, it's considered a normal statement. Therefore, it's **X: No Claim** with a score of X.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking a question about which method was used, which doesn't provide any feedback or suggestions to the authors. It doesn't help them improve their work because it's just a factual inquiry without any actionable insights. So, it's **Not Helpful at All** with a score of 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON output should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I'm trying to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review point says that at odd times, \u03b8 isn't one, so the adversary can generate a datum to make an error. It mentions that the average coverage rate is 0.5, which is larger than the bound by the theorem. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here, but I think the point is suggesting that under certain conditions, the system isn't meeting the expected coverage. So, the action suggested is to point out this issue. Is this action explicit? Yes, it clearly states the condition and the consequence. Is it concrete? It tells the authors exactly what to look for and what the problem is. So, I'd say this is highly actionable because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions \u03b8 at odd times, but I'm not sure if it specifically refers to a part of the paper. It seems more like a general statement about the system's behavior rather than addressing a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper. The specificity about the issue is also lacking because it's a general claim about the system's performance rather than pointing out a particular problem in the authors' work. Therefore, this review isn't fully grounded and isn't specific about the issue.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review claims that the average coverage rate is 0.5, which is larger than the bound. But does it provide any justification for this claim? It just states the result without explaining why it's the case or how it was derived. There's no logical reasoning or references provided, so it's not verifiable. It's more of a factual statement without any supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a potential issue with the system but doesn't provide actionable steps for the authors to fix it. It's more of a critique of the system rather than giving direct feedback on the authors' work. Since it doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements, it's not very helpful. The authors wouldn't know how to address the problem based on this feedback.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts: the review is highly actionable because it's explicit and concrete, but it's not grounded, not verifiable, and not helpful because it doesn't provide meaningful feedback to the authors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}

It's an explicit statement about the issue, so it's clear what needs to be done. However, it doesn't provide specific steps or details on how to adjust the annotations. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions different translator choices but doesn't specify which part of the paper is affected.

The review suggests a reason why people wear a hat and play guitar instead of the other way around, but it doesn't specify what the issue is or how to fix it. It's a bit vague.

It's too general. There's no mention of a specific section, table, or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint where the issue lies.

So, the reviewer is directly pointing out a potential issue. Now, is this action clear? The reviewer suggests that 2000 examples are insufficient, which gives the authors a clear direction to consider more data. So, this is explicit and concrete. Therefore, it's highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to look into.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to \"2000 examples\" without specifying which part of the paper or model this relates to. It's a general statement, so the authors can infer that it's about the dataset size, but they might not pinpoint exactly where this applies. However, it's clear enough that they can identify the section related to model training or dataset size. So, it's fully grounded because the reviewer mentions a specific part, even if it's not explicitly named.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that 2000 examples might be insufficient. The justification is that more data is generally better, which is a common knowledge point. The reviewer doesn't provide external references, but the reasoning is logical and based on general understanding. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's supported by common knowledge, though it could be better by including references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue (insufficient examples) and suggests considering more data. It's clear and actionable, giving the authors a specific direction. While it doesn't go into how to increase the dataset, it's still helpful because it identifies an improvement area.

It's explicit about the method and the comparison, so that's good. However, it's quite vague about what the advantages are. The user doesn't get specific guidance on how to apply this or what changes to make. So, it's not fully actionable because the advantages aren't detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions Algorithm 1 and compares it to variational inference, which is specific.

It doesn't specify what needs to be done, so it's not explicit. It's more of a statement pointing out a problem without suggesting a fix. So, it's implicit. Since it's not giving clear instructions, it's not actionable. Maybe a 1 or 2 here.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions specific lines (225 and 227) and points out the ambiguity. So, it's clearly identifying the part of the paper, which is strong grounding. It's not just a vague comment but specifically addresses the issue. So, this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim because it's suggesting that the Gaussian expression is ambiguous.

They're making a general comment about the need for additional responses, not pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a judgment that more responses are needed. This is a claim because they're suggesting a change. They don't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's just a statement that something is missing, so it's not verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't offering any solutions.

I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does suggest an action but doesn't detail how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out the lack of an ablation study on training techniques. It mentions specific techniques like IPI and v-prediction, which are clearly referenced. The comment is specific about the part of the paper it's addressing, so it's fully grounded. It also clearly states what's missing, which adds specificity. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting that an ablation study is needed. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's not verifiable. It's just a statement without justification, so it's \"Unverifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a clear weakness in the paper by pointing out the missing ablation study.

The explicit action is pointing out redundancy, which is clear. However, the suggestion to add an experiment is a bit vague.

They're asking the authors to reorganize the section, which is a directive, but it's not very detailed. So, it's more implicit because the reviewer isn't specifying exactly how to reorganize it. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. Maybe a 3 or 4?

The question is why they didn't use the differential functions themselves. The comment is asking for a reason, but it's not giving a specific action or suggestion. It's more of a question, so it's not explicit. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next.

The comment mentions Equations (9) and (10) and asks why Taylor expansions were used instead of the differential functions. It does identify the specific part of the paper (the equations) and explains what was done. So, it's fully grounded because it points to the exact section. It's also specific because it explains the choice of Taylor expansions. So, this should be 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nVerifiability.

It's pretty specific about which part of the paper to look at and which external works to cite. So, this has strong grounding because it accurately points to the section and provides references.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review cites three external papers.

It references Table 3 and Section 4, which are clear references in the paper. The reviewer is not just making a general statement but is pointing to a specific part of the paper where the problem lies.

They're not just stating a problem but also providing a possible solution. That seems pretty explicit. So, I think this is actionable because the authors can look at the notation and decide whether to use F or F and S. It's not vague; it's clear what the issue is and what the possible fix is. So, I'd rate this as highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is talking about L_flow, which I assume is a specific part of the paper. The reviewer is addressing the notation, so they're pinpointing where the ambiguity is. They're not just saying it's unclear but are referencing a specific part of the paper. That means they're fully grounded because they're clearly identifying the section being discussed. They're also being specific about the notation, so this is a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The reviewer is making a claim that the current notation is ambiguous and suggesting a better notation. They're providing a suggestion, which is a claim, and they're asking for a more precise notation, which is supporting evidence. They're not citing external references, but their reasoning is logical\u2014suggesting a better notation based on clarity. So, their claim is somewhat justified, but they're not providing external references. I think this is somewhat verifiable, so a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a problem and suggesting a solution. They're being helpful by identifying an issue and offering a possible fix. While it's a good suggestion, it's somewhat vague in terms of how exactly to implement it. The authors might need more details on whether F and S are specific parameters or something else. So, it's helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this as somewhat helpful, which is a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are: actionability 5, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 3, helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests that the reviewer is pointing out a lack of originality. However, it doesn't specify what the authors should do next. It's a valid point but doesn't give actionable steps.

It's more of a statement of observation without providing actionable feedback. So, it's not explicit or vague. Since it doesn't tell the authors what to do, it's not actionable. Therefore, the actionability score is 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about the complexity of problems involving different types of neural networks. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to, like a particular section, table, or figure. It's a general statement without pinpointing an issue. So, the grounding is weak because it can't accurately identify the referenced part. The specificity is also low because it doesn't clearly explain what's wrong or how to fix it. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that MLPs are more complex than FBDDs and perceptrons. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence to support this claim. It's just a statement without backing, so it's not verifiable. The verifiability score is 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

It's explicit about the action, telling the authors to discuss these aspects. However, it's vague on how to implement this. The authors might not know which specific hyperparameters to focus on or how to analyze their impact. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about Figure 4 and mentions specific hyperparameters. It clearly references a specific part of the paper (Figure 4) and lists examples of hyperparameters. This shows that the authors can identify the referenced part and what's missing. So, this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review points out that different hyperparameters could affect the algorithm's biases. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's making a judgment about the importance of these hyperparameters but lacks justification or references.

It suggests using 'honest-but-curious' instead. Now, is this explicit? Yes, it's telling the authors what's wrong and what should be used. But is it concrete? It mentions the terminology but doesn't specify how to replace it or where exactly the issue is. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this would be a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions 'semi-honst' in section 4 and suggests an alternative term. It's specific about the terminology but doesn't clearly point to why it's problematic or where in the paper it's used. So, it's not fully grounded because the authors might have to infer where exactly the issue is.

It's pretty explicit about asking for these details, so that's clear. Now, are these actions explicit or implicit? Since the reviewer is directly asking for these pieces of information, it's explicit. Next, are these actions concrete? Yes, because the reviewer is not just asking for what's missing but also specifically what each term refers to. So, the action is both explicit and concrete. That should give it a high actionability score, maybe a 5.\n\nMoving on to grounding_specificity. The reviewer is asking about optimizer, initialization, and PPO-zero. But the review doesn't specify which part of the paper these relate to. It's a bit vague because it's not pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the reviewer isn't clearly identifying which part of the paper is being addressed.

It also mentions the techniques are for bias/variance reduction, not directly related to extrapolation. It suggests the methods don't mitigate the error, leading to better performance. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is directly pointing out the lack of evidence, so that's explicit. Is it concrete? The reviewer is suggesting that the techniques don't address the issue, which gives a clear direction for the authors to add evidence. So I think this is highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions extrapolation error and the techniques, which are specific parts of the paper. They also point out that the methods aren't related, which is specific to the techniques. So the grounding is solid because they're pinpointing the sections.

The reviewer is pointing out that the strategy's name is similar to LSTM. Is this clearly referencing the specific part of the paper? The comment doesn't mention a specific section or figure, just the name. So, the grounding is weak because it's an educated guess, not pinpointing a part.

Additionally, it explains what's wrong with that part, making specificity high. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the attribution maps aren't intuitive and point out specific issues. It supports this with the observation that the analysis works quantitatively but lacks qualitative value. This provides some justification, so it's somewhat verifiable. It's not fully verifiable because it doesn't cite external references or logical reasoning beyond the quantitative aspect.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out specific issues with the attribution maps, which is helpful for the authors. However, it's somewhat vague about how to improve the maps. While it's clear that there's a problem, the suggestions are not detailed enough. So, it's somewhat helpful because it identifies areas for improvement but doesn't provide comprehensive guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: 3 (Somewhat Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

The review mentions that the title overclaims the contribution and points out that the results are only on BERT and RoBERTa, not LLaMA. It suggests the method should be scalable and asks for justification. The explicit action is to address the overclaiming title, point out the missing LLaMA results, and ask for scalability. However, the suggestion to show justification is somewhat vague. It doesn't specify how to demonstrate scalability or what kind of empirical data is needed. So, it's not fully actionable but still explicit. I think this is **Somewhat Actionable (3)** because the action is clear but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review explicitly mentions BERT, RoBERTa, and LLaMA, which are specific models. It also points out the lack of results on LLaMA, which is a unique aspect. The grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections and elements being discussed.

The justification provided is vague\u2014it suggests scalability but doesn't offer specific references or examples. There's no external citation or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion. This makes it **Somewhat Verifiable (3)** because there's some justification but it's not robust or detailed.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is clear about the issues and provides specific suggestions, which is helpful.

It's unclear if this is a significant contribution. The reviewer is pointing out that the rationale of Theorem 1 is mostly based on [38], making it seem like a simple fact. \n\nIs this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is making a statement about the authors' contribution, which is explicit. However, the reviewer isn't giving a clear action or suggestion on how to improve. They're pointing out that the contribution might be incremental and suggesting that the authors should consider a broader approach. So, it's not very actionable because the reviewer isn't telling the authors what to do next. They're more asking for consideration rather than giving a direct fix. So, I'd rate this as **2: Borderline Actionable** because it's clear but lacks specific guidance.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer mentions [38] as the basis for Theorem 1. This is a specific reference, so the grounding is clear. They also point out that the rationale is simple, which is a specific observation about the paper.

The first part talks about an in-depth analysis, which is explicit. It also suggests looking at running time and complexity, which gives a clear direction.

The review is asking for clarification on how the 10 runs were conducted. It's not giving a direct action like suggesting to add something or fix a method. So, it's more of an implicit action.

It's more of a general suggestion, so I'd give it a **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting questions about LLM quality and parameters. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just a statement without justification, so it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential issue with PromptMix's reliance on LLMs and suggesting an analysis. It's somewhat helpful because it identifies a potential weakness, but it's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the experimental validation only uses CIFAR-10/100 as in-distribution data. It points out that while the results are strong, it's unclear if the conclusions would hold for other datasets. Now, is this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is suggesting improvements but isn't giving specific instructions on what to do next. They're raising a concern, which is an implicit action. Since it's not telling the authors exactly what to do, it's not fully actionable. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an improvement area but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about in-distribution datasets but doesn't specify which ones or provide examples. They're asking if conclusions generalize, which is a bit vague. They don't mention any unique aspects of the paper or reference specific sections. So, this is **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because they can't pinpoint the issue clearly.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment about whether conclusions generalize. They're asking if other datasets should be considered, which is a subjective opinion. There's no supporting evidence or references provided. So, this is a **Claim without Supporting Evidence**, which falls under **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review raises a valid concern about the dataset's generalizability. It provides some insight but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or solutions. It's clear and raises important points, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully constructive. Therefore, it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests showing the gradient conflicts ratio for AlphaNets trained with alpha-divergence. It's an explicit action because it directly tells the authors what to do. But is it concrete? Yes, because it specifies exactly what data to show. So this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions AlphaNets and specifically alpha-divergence. It's clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper, so that's full grounding. It also specifies what needs to be shown, which adds to the specificity. So this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion, which is a claim. It's supported by logical reasoning because showing the gradient conflicts ratio would provide insights. There's no mention of external references, but the reasoning is clear. So this is somewhat verifiable, maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out a limitation and suggests a specific improvement. It's clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful. It should get a 5.\n\nPutting it all together, all aspects are 5 except maybe verifiability, which I think is 4. Wait, no, the claim is supported by logical reasoning, so maybe it's 5. I'll stick with 5 for all.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review suggests that the SDF supervision could be simplified by sampling a subset of points and applying the loss without considering occlusion. It mentions that this would be simpler and more straightforward. The reviewer also implies that the current method is complicated without providing a clear reason or ablation study. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives explicit instructions on what the authors should do. The reviewer does suggest a simpler approach, which is explicit. However, the suggestion is quite vague\u2014like just saying \"sample a subset\" without specifics on how. So, it's not very detailed. Therefore, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it tells them what to do but doesn't give precise steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer refers to the SDF loss and mentions occlusion handling and view-aware aspects. They do point out specific sections of the paper (like lines 165, 173, 177-178). This shows that they are accurately identifying parts of the paper, which is full grounding. They also clearly specify what's wrong with the current approach, which adds specificity. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer makes a claim that the current setup is complicated without a good reason. They suggest a simpler alternative but don't provide evidence or references to back up their claims. They also mention the absence of an ablation study, which could be seen as a lack of justification. Since they're pointing out a problem but not providing solid support, this is **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but it's not robust.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer provides a critique of the current method and suggests an alternative, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is quite vague and lacks depth. They don't explain why the current setup is problematic beyond a general statement. This makes the feedback somewhat helpful but not entirely. So, I'd rate this as **Somewhat Helpful** because it does offer some insights but isn't comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Somewhat Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}
