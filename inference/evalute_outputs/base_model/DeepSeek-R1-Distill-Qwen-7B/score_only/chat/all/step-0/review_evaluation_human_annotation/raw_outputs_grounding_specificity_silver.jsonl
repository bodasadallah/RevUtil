However, the review doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done, like whether they want specific metrics or just a general analysis. So, it's explicit but vague. That would fall under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear that analysis is needed but lacks detail on how to apply it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions \"the quality of the collected dataset\" and \"the amount of noise.\" It doesn't specify which part of the dataset or what kind of noise, so the grounding is weak. The comment doesn't clearly identify the referenced part, which means it's not fully grounded. Since it's not pinpointing a specific section or issue, it's **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a suggestion to conduct more analysis but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is necessary. It's a claim (suggestion) without supporting reasoning or references. So, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing to show why more analysis is needed.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking for more analysis but doesn't specify what they want or how it would help. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps. Therefore, it's **2: Barely Helpful** because while it's a meaningful suggestion, it lacks clarity and direction for the authors.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own score based on how well the review provides actionable feedback, grounds the issue, supports its claims, and helps the authors improve their work.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests this might introduce noise. The comment is explicit about the issue and provides a clear explanation of why it's a problem. It also gives a concrete example of how this could introduce noise. So, this is both explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review clearly mentions the specific part of the paper being discussed, which is the description of HIERENC. It also explains what the issue is, so the grounding is explicit and specific. This means the authors can easily identify the problem and understand why it's an issue. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that averaging all possible entity instantiations introduces noise. It provides a logical explanation and an example, which supports the claim. This makes the claim thoroughly justified, so it's fully verifiable. I'll give this a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is very clear and provides specific feedback on a particular part of the method. It suggests a clear improvement, which would be beneficial for the authors. The feedback is actionable and directly addresses a potential issue, making it highly helpful.

It also asks readers to understand how stable points in probabilistic metric space are obtained, which might be necessary to repeat the results. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The comment is asking for something, which is an action, so it's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to implement this? It just suggests adding more discussions and explaining the stable points. It doesn't provide specific steps or methods, so it's more implicit.

It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a particular section or figure. So the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded since it's not explicitly pointing to a specific part.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the necessity of explaining convergence and stable points. It's suggesting that readers might find it hard to repeat the results without this information. However, it doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up why this is necessary. It's more of a general statement rather than a claim that's well-supported.

They're suggesting a method but not specifying how to apply it. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an opinion or a suggestion, which is a normal statement. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, actionability would be 1.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"the example of Fig.\" but doesn't specify which figure or where in the paper it's referring to. It's vague about the part of the paper being addressed. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint the issue. It's not fully grounded. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is subjective. The reviewer is expressing a personal preference about attacking texts with reasoning chains but isn't providing any evidence or justification. There's no claim here that needs verification. So, it's a normal statement, which means verifiability is X.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is more about the reviewer's opinion on a method rather than providing concrete feedback on the paper's content.

It also asks if the experts are linguistic or domain experts, whether annotation differs from non-experts, and if it introduces linguistic challenges. \n\nLooking at the explicitness, the review is clear and specific. It doesn't just suggest something; it asks direct questions. So that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The review doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do, like adding specific examples or sections. It's more of a general guideline. So it's explicit but not concrete. Therefore, on a scale of 1 to 5, this would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to experts, annotation, linguistic vs. domain experts, and challenges. It mentions specific aspects like traits and justification, which grounds it well. It's not just vague; it points to particular areas. So the grounding is strong. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, like the differences between experts and non-experts.

Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about examples on actual texts compared to other components. It mentions specific elements like \"actual texts\" and \"other components & models.\" So, it's clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. That means it's fully grounded because it's accurately pinpointing the area. But is it specific about what needs to be addressed? It's suggesting examples, which is a bit vague, but it's definitely addressing a specific part.

It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do. So, it's not giving a clear action or specific steps. Therefore, it's not actionable. I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions standard techniques but doesn't specify which part of the paper or why they require technical competency.

It also suggests a more detailed algorithmic presentation. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The review does state what needs to be done, like adding motivation and a detailed algorithm. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? It says \"add more evidence\" and \"present the algorithm more clearly,\" which are pretty vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to add evidence or structure the algorithm. Maybe they need guidance on where to look or what specific data to include. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit about what needs to be done but lacks specifics on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about GaRare and its advantages over GaLore but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It also mentions the algorithm but doesn't point to a specific section or unique aspect. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The comment is general, so it's **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review contains claims about the lack of motivation and the need for a more detailed algorithm. It also suggests improvements. Now, for verifiability, we need to see if these claims are supported. The claim about lacking evidence is somewhat justified by mentioning the need for justification, but it's not very detailed. The suggestion for a detailed algorithm is a bit vague too. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided beyond the statements. So, this is **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but not enough to fully support the claims.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out clear issues and provides suggestions for improvement.

It's pointing out that other works exist but doesn't tell the authors how to incorporate that information. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which makes it borderline actionable because it's vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review does mention specific works, which is good. It's not just a general statement but references particular papers. However, it doesn't specify what part of the paper or what aspect of the model needs to be addressed. So, it's fully grounded in terms of mentioning the works but lacks specificity in what needs to be done. That would make it somewhat grounded and specific, but since it doesn't specify, I think it's actually fully grounded because it mentions the specific works, but not specific parts of the paper. Wait, no, the definition says if it can be accurately pinpointed. Since it's referring to general works, maybe it's not fully grounded. Hmm, maybe it's weakly grounded because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. But the review does mention specific papers, so perhaps it's fully grounded. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Grounding is about identifying the specific part of the paper. The review doesn't say anything about the model or the specific sections, just that similar work exists. So maybe it's not fully grounded. It's more like it's pointing out that similar work exists but not where or how. So perhaps it's weakly grounded because the authors can infer that the model structure is similar, but it's not explicitly stated. So maybe it's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by pointing out that similar work exists. It's suggesting that the authors should consider incorporating that into their model. Now, is this claim verifiable? The review doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states that other works exist. So, there's no supporting evidence or reasoning. Therefore, it's unverifiable. It lacks any backing, so it's not helpful in terms of verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out that there's existing work with a similar structure, which could be useful. However, it doesn't specify how this can be applied or what changes the authors need to make. It's a relevant point but lacks actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful because it's relevant, but not entirely helpful because it doesn't guide the authors on what to do next. It's more of a suggestion without concrete steps, so maybe it's somewhat helpful.\n\nWait, but the helpfulness scale goes from 1 to 5. Since it's pointing out a relevant area but not providing specific actions, it's probably somewhat helpful, which is a 3. But I'm not entirely sure.

It mentions that the baseline models aren't well introduced. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The comment here is pointing out a problem but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's more of a general critique without concrete steps. So, it's not explicit or detailed.

It suggests that these other methods are computationally efficient and have similar guarantees. Now, for actionability, I need to see if this comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a lack of contrast, which is an explicit action. However, the suggestion to \"contrast\" is vague because it doesn't specify how or where to make the comparison.

Therefore, this should be **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about other methods but doesn't specify which ones or provide details on how they compare. The reviewer mentions TSC and Park's method but doesn't clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.

It suggests using another dataset for an ablation study. The action here is clear: the reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with the claim and suggesting a change. However, the suggestion is a bit vague. It doesn't specify which dataset to use or why another dataset would be better. So, it's an implicit action but lacks concrete details. That would make it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions using another dataset, but they don't explicitly name which one. They refer to \"the training set of Tanks & Temples or ETH3D.\" This is a specific mention, so the grounding is pretty clear. They're pointing out a specific alternative dataset, which means the part of the paper they're addressing is well-defined. Therefore, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the original claim (about the modules' performance) might not hold because of the dataset used.

The reviewer is making a suggestion about the authors' approach, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is pointing out that previous work considers multiple vulnerabilities, which gives the authors a clear direction on what they might be missing.

It suggests that more explanations are needed. So, the action here is to provide more details. Is this explicit? Yes, because it's directly telling the authors where to look. Is it concrete? It does specify where to find the explanation, so I think it's actionable. So, this should be a 4 or 5.

So that's explicit. Now, for concreteness, the reviewer isn't just saying \"more details\" but specifically mentions the definition of resistance distance and Algorithm 1. They also suggest brief sentences, which adds detail on how to implement the changes. So this is quite concrete. \n\nTherefore, the actionability seems high. It's not just stating a problem but actively guiding the authors on what to do. So I'd rate this as 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**.

It's not a claim that requires evidence, but it's a suggestion. Since it's a judgment, it doesn't need external references or logical reasoning beyond the paper's context. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's based on the paper's existing content, but it's not providing new evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is clear about what needs to be added but doesn't specify how. It's helpful in pointing out the omission but lacks depth. So, it's somewhat helpful because it identifies an improvement area, but it doesn't give enough guidance on how to fix it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests that this would lead to impractically large learning rates. The comment is explicit about the issue, so that's good. It also provides some guidance on why this is a problem, which is helpful. However, it doesn't give specific steps on how to modify the learning rate or suggest alternatives. So, it's explicit but not very concrete. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear but lacks detailed implementation guidance.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the required condition on the learning rate and mentions that it's not scalable. It doesn't explicitly point to a specific part of the paper, like a particular section or figure, so the grounding is weak. It does, however, clearly states what's wrong, which is specific. So, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it identifies the issue but doesn't pinpoint the exact location in the paper.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the required condition isn't realistic because in practice, the step size doesn't grow with the sample size. It provides some reasoning about the implications of large learning rates but doesn't cite external references or logical deductions. The reasoning is a bit vague, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Verifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a significant issue with the learning rate condition and suggests that it's unrealistic.

Then, it asks about whether the performance improvement is due to network design or ImageNet characteristics. It also mentions that algorithms skipping layers or channels don't have the same advantage. This gives clear directions on what the authors should do, so it's explicit. The action is to show the graphs, and the reasoning is clear, so it's concrete. Therefore, this should be Highly Actionable (5).\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity.

It questions the effectiveness of the proposed methods and suggests that under different time-step scenarios, the method might make more sense. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a scenario where the method doesn't perform better, but they're also suggesting a different scenario. However, the suggestion isn't very specific. They don't tell the authors exactly what to change or how to adjust the time-steps. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implication, which makes it implicit. Since it's implicit, it's not fully actionable. So, I'd rate this as **2: Borderline Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't specify how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to Figure 5 by name, which is specific. They mention the performance comparison between two models, which is a clear part of the paper. They don't make any educated guesses or vague references. So, the grounding is strong because they accurately pinpoint the section being discussed. Therefore, this should be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because they do identify the part and specify what's being compared.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the effectiveness is questionable under certain conditions.

It mentions specific parts of the paper like the agreement between predicted scores and actual risk. It doesn't refer to any specific sections or tables, but it does point out the importance of calibration curves, which are a specific part.

It also asks if this is unique to sparsity detection or true for GNNs in general. The reviewer mentions Section 4.3 but doesn't specify how to improve it. So, the action here is vague. The reviewer isn't giving explicit instructions on what to do next, which makes it less actionable. It's more of a question than a suggestion, so it's not very actionable. I'd rate this as 2 because it's borderline\u2014there's an implicit action of questioning, but it's vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Section 4.3 but doesn't specify exactly which part or what's missing. It's too vague about the issue. The grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or element. The specificity is also low since it doesn't clearly explain what needs improvement. So, this is weakly grounded and not specific. I'd give it a 2 here as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by stating that all sparsity patterns perform similarly and questioning if this is a general GNN issue. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification for this claim. It's just a statement without backing, so it's not verifiable. I'd score this as 1 because it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is somewhat helpful in pointing out that sparsity patterns are similar, which might help the authors identify if they need to look elsewhere. However, it's not very detailed and doesn't provide actionable steps. It's more of a general observation without concrete suggestions, so it's somewhat helpful but not highly so. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is borderline or somewhat helpful but not fully actionable or verifiable.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review says the introduction to orthogonality in Part 2 could be more detailed. Is this explicit or implicit? It's explicit because it's directly telling the authors what to do. It doesn't ask them to infer, so that's good. Now, is it concrete? It suggests adding more details, but it doesn't specify how. So it's somewhat actionable because the authors know they need to expand on that section, but they might need more guidance on what exactly to add. So I'd rate this as 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions Part 2 but doesn't specify which section or what exactly is lacking. It's a general statement, so the authors can't pinpoint where the detail is missing. That means it's not grounded because they don't know exactly which part they need to improve. So grounding_specificity would be 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that more detail is needed. Is this claim supported? Well, it's a suggestion, so it's a claim. But there's no justification or evidence provided. It's vague and doesn't reference any external sources or logical reasoning. So it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review tells the authors what to do but doesn't specify how. It's clear and actionable in pointing out the need for more detail, which is helpful. However, it's not the most detailed feedback, so it's somewhat helpful.

It talks about previous studies and references, which is more of a summary. There's no clear guidance on what the authors should do next, like suggesting improvements or changes. So, it's not actionable because it lacks direct instructions or steps to follow.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to specific prior works and datasets like CIFAR-10.1, CINIC-10, and CIFAR-10-C. It mentions specific studies, like RobustBench and [A, B], which are clearly mentioned. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to specific sections or parts of the paper. It's not just a vague statement; it's specific enough for the authors to look into those references.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review does provide some justification by citing specific studies and datasets. It references [Croce et al. (2021)] and [A, B], which are external works. This means the claims made about prior analyses are supported by references, making it somewhat verifiable. However, the justification is a bit brief, so it's not fully robust but still provides some support.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers some insights into prior work and references, which could be helpful for the authors to understand existing literature. However, it doesn't provide actionable suggestions or detailed guidance on how to improve their work. It's informative but lacks the depth needed to be highly helpful. So, it's somewhat helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the review isn't actionable because it doesn't suggest specific changes. It's well-grounded because it references specific prior works.

This is an explicit statement, so it's clear what the reviewer is saying. It doesn't require the authors to infer anything; they know exactly what the issue is. Also, the reviewer provides a concrete reason why it's not an ablation study. So, this is highly actionable because it's explicit and gives a clear direction for the authors to consider.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"the study about different subdomain sizes\" and specifies that it's not an ablation study. They also explain why by pointing out that they didn't remove a component. This clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being discussed and explains the issue. So, the grounding is strong because they pinpoint the section and provide a clear reason. It's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the study isn't an ablation study. They support this by stating that they didn't remove any component. This is logical reasoning and provides a clear justification. There's no need for external references because the explanation is straightforward. So, this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is clear and directly addresses the concern about the study not being an ablation study. They provide a reason why, which is helpful for the authors. It's not vague or overly technical, so it's useful but could be slightly expanded.

The reviewer is pointing out a problem and suggesting a comparison, but they're not directly telling the authors what to do. They're implying that using more efficient 3D CNNs could be better, but the authors still need to figure out how to apply this. So, it's implicit because the authors have to infer the action.

It suggests enriching the results but doesn't specify how. The action is clear\u2014enriching the results\u2014but the method isn't detailed, making it vague. So, this is **Explicit but vague**, which falls under **Somewhat Actionable** (3).\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out issues with the experiment but doesn't specify which part of the paper or results it refers to. It talks about different strengths and thresholds but doesn't tie them to specific sections or tables. This means the grounding is weak because the referenced part isn't clearly identified. So, this is **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** (2).\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the results are lacking and that different thresholds aren't analyzed. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references to support these points. The claim is unsupported, so this is **Unverifiable** (1).\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers suggestions but doesn't elaborate on how to implement them. It's vague and doesn't provide concrete steps, making it somewhat helpful but not fully. So, this is **Somewhat Helpful** (3).\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It's a good question, but is it explicit? The reviewer is suggesting a follow-up experiment, which is an action. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to measure the difference or what metrics to use. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 or 4?\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper, L170, and is asking about performance differences. They're referring to specific methods (image sizes and ResNet variations), so this is fully grounded. The specificity is high because they're asking about a particular aspect of the methodology.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment about the impact of these changes. They're suggesting an experiment, which is a claim. The justification is vague because it doesn't reference external literature or provide a logical explanation. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. Maybe a 3 or 4?\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is asking a question that could be useful for the authors. It's not entirely clear how to proceed, but it does suggest an area for improvement. It's somewhat helpful because it prompts an investigation, but it's not very detailed. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores are around 3 for all aspects except maybe grounding, which is fully grounded, so maybe 5.

That's explicit, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The review tells the authors exactly what to do: present and describe the algorithm. It doesn't leave room for interpretation, so it's concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about presenting the algorithm in detail. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly the algorithm is located. It's a general suggestion.

It then asks if there's existing work around this, and if not, suggests adding a couple of lines explaining it's an open problem. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. This review is making an explicit suggestion to add a couple of lines. It's clear and gives a direct action, so that's explicit. It also provides some guidance on what to add, which is concrete. So, this should be **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's explicit and gives a clear direction, but maybe it's a bit vague on how exactly to add those lines or what specific content to include. Wait, no, it does say \"a line or two should be added that there exists no solution for this, and it is an open (hard) problem.\" So it's pretty explicit about what to add. I think it's **5: Highly Actionable** because it's explicit and gives a clear action.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to FFNs and mentions that linear decomposition isn't possible. It's pretty specific about the issue, so it's clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. Then, it suggests looking for existing work or adding lines about it being an open problem. So, it's grounded because it's specific about the part of the paper and the issue. It doesn't mention external work, but it's clear about the problem. So, **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately identifies the section and the issue without ambiguity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that there's existing work around FFNs or that it's an open problem. It's suggesting that if not, a specific addition should be made. The claim is that such work exists or not, and it's providing a suggestion. The justification is that it improves readability and gives a clearer picture. The reasoning is logical, and it's based on common knowledge about research challenges. So, it's thoroughly supported. Therefore, **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a limitation in the paper, suggesting either existing solutions or explaining it's an open problem. It's clear and provides meaningful feedback. It's not just pointing out a problem but also suggesting solutions or areas for improvement. This is helpful because it guides the authors to either find alternative methods or acknowledge the limitation.

So, the action suggested is to point out the unfairness, but it doesn't give clear steps on how to fix it. That makes it somewhat vague. So, I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does explicitly state an action but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions sample weights but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a bit vague about what's unfair. So, the grounding isn't fully established. I'd rate this as **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because it doesn't pinpoint the exact section or issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that the comparison is unfair due to different sample weights. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating an opinion without supporting evidence. So, this is **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing for the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue in the comparison but doesn't offer concrete suggestions on how to address it. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much in improving their work. So, this is **2: Barely Helpful** because it does identify a problem but lacks actionable steps.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 2\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review is pointing out a specific part of the methodology, so it's grounded because it's referring to the training approach. It's not just a general question but specifically about the model's training on the entire dataset. That's clear and specific, so it's 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim about the generalization capability of the model. It's suggesting that if the entire dataset is used, the model might not generalize well without labels. This is a claim that can be supported by common knowledge in machine learning, like overfitting issues. So, it's verifiable, probably a 4: Mostly Verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential issue with the model's training approach, which is helpful for the authors to consider.

So, it's not giving a clear step-by-step action, just pointing out a potential issue. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. Maybe a 3 or 4?\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about Matern kernels specifically. It mentions that their spectrum decays polynomially, which is a specific detail. The authors can identify exactly where the issue lies, so this is fully grounded. It's also specific because it's not a general statement but a reference to a particular type of kernel. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests that Matern kernels have polynomial decay. This is a claim because it's making a judgment about the kernels' properties. The justification is that they are commonly used and their spectra don't fit the sub-gaussian assumption. This is logical reasoning and references common knowledge, so it's fully verifiable. That would be a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation that could make the authors' results restrictive. It's clear and provides insight into potential areas for improvement. It's helpful because it guides them to consider alternative kernels or adjust their analysis. It's not the most detailed, but it's still useful. So, a 4 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores are: Actionability 3, Grounding Specificity 5, Verifiability 5, Helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment explicitly states the issue (equation-driven presentation) and suggests a solution (an illustrative figure). That's pretty direct. It doesn't just say \"improve the presentation\"; it specifies what to do. So, it's explicit. Also, it gives a clear action: add a figure.

It's explicit about the action, which is to expand the experiments. But it doesn't specify how to implement this, like which environments to choose or how many more. So it's explicit but lacks detail. That makes it **Borderline Actionable** because the action is clear, but the implementation isn't specified.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The comment mentions \"one game environment\" and \"different game environments.\" It's pretty specific about the part of the paper that needs improvement. It doesn't make vague claims about the paper as a whole but targets a specific aspect. So this is **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it clearly points to the issue without ambiguity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that more experiments are necessary. It's a claim because it suggests an improvement. The justification is general, saying more experiments are needed, but it doesn't provide specific references or reasoning. So it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some support, but it's not detailed or backed by external evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment points out a limitation and suggests improvement, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, though it doesn't specify exactly what experiments to add. It's **Mostly Helpful** because it addresses a clear issue and gives a direction for improvement without being overly vague.\n\nSo putting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding_specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 3\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests that concrete predictions can't be tested with simulations. This provides a clear action for the authors to consider the implications of an exhaustive list and its practicality. The comment is explicit and gives a direct action, so it's actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the \"most common case of recognition, old vs new judgments\" and mentions that the list is exhaustive.

The reviewer is pointing out a lack of clarity, so it's more of an implicit suggestion. They aren't giving a direct action, just pointing out a problem. So, it's not highly actionable because the authors still need to figure out what to do. Maybe they should be told to make the contribution clearer or to specify how they choose the number of bins.

They're not just vague; they're pinning down exact sections. So, the grounding is strong. Also, they're suggesting specific additions, which makes it specific. Therefore, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that adding this information will help motivate the method and provide readers with useful insights. They're not just stating a fact; they're offering a justification. The justification is logical and provides value, so this is **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is providing clear suggestions that directly address the paper's strengths and potential weaknesses. They're offering actionable advice that can significantly improve the paper.

So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim that the network doesn't directly learn the mapping. They're suggesting that it's instead fitting the residual. Is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a specific behavior, but they're not providing evidence or references. They're just stating an observation. So, without supporting data or citations, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 3? Because it's somewhat verifiable if the authors can infer from their own results, but without explicit backing, it's a bit unclear.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue the authors should address. They're asking for details on a particular training method. This is helpful because it guides the authors to look into their methodology. It's clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful. So, a 5 here.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, maybe it's a 3 because the reviewer isn't providing evidence, so the claim is somewhat verifiable if the authors can figure it out themselves, but it's not fully supported. So, I'll stick with 3 for verifiability.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review point is asking about the experiment setup in Section 3.3, specifically mentioning data augmentation methods and learning rate. It also references a paper, BadNets. I think the action here is pointing the authors to check Section 3.3 and the referenced paper for details. But is this explicit or implicit? The comment doesn't tell them exactly where to look, just mentions the section and paper. So it's more implicit. Now, is it concrete? Well, it's not giving specific steps or modifications, just directing them to check. So I'd say it's borderline actionable because it's implicit but doesn't ask for detailed changes.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions Section 3.3 and the BadNets paper. Is this clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper? Yes, it's pretty explicit about the section and references another paper. So the grounding is strong. It's fully grounded because it accurately points to the section and external work without needing more context.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment about the necessity of evaluating the setup, which is a claim. It's suggesting that the authors should look into the BadNets paper. Now, is this justified? The comment references a specific paper, so it's supported by external evidence. It's logical and provides a reference, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is asking the authors to check a specific section and reference another paper. It's clear and provides direction, but it doesn't offer specific suggestions on what changes to make. It's helpful in that it guides them to relevant information but doesn't give actionable steps beyond that.

It's asking if the authors did a statistical significance test. The comment is suggesting a possible action, but it's not explicit. It's more of a question, so it's implicit. Since it's not clear how to apply this action, it's not concrete. So, this is borderline actionable because it implies an action but doesn't provide detailed guidance.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity.

It doesn't specify exactly how or what needs to be changed. So, it's not explicit. It's more of a suggestion without concrete steps, which makes it somewhat vague. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it's clear that the authors need to figure out which tasks are computable but doesn't give detailed instructions.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific inference tasks like filtering, smoothing, and marginal likelihood. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, so that's full grounding. It also specifies what needs to be computed, which adds to the specificity.

It also suggests discussing implications for low-rank matrix factorization. The action here is pointing out redundancy and suggesting a discussion. Is this explicit or implicit? It's explicit because it clearly states the redundancy and provides a suggestion. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer gives a specific area to discuss, so yes, it's concrete.

It doesn't mention specific sections, tables, or figures, but it does point out a general area. So the grounding is explicit because it refers to a specific part of the paper (the introduction) and a specific area (low-rank matrix factorization).

So, it's not giving an explicit action or a clear instruction on how to proceed. It's more of a question, which might be considered implicit. Since it's not directly telling the authors what to do, it's not very actionable.

The comment refers to the alternating direction method but doesn't specify which one. It just says \"which method,\" which is a bit vague. The authors might have to guess, so it's not fully grounded. It's only weakly grounded because it's not clearly pointing to a specific method. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific, but wait, no.

The comment mentions that it's not a new approach, which could imply that the method is common, but it doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next.

It's vague because it doesn't provide explicit instructions or concrete details on how to improve. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it hints at an action but doesn't give specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions the decision head but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's unclear whether it's about the method, results, or discussion section. So, the grounding is weak because it can't confidently identify the referenced part.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the need for results discussion but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just stating an opinion without supporting references or logical reasoning. So, it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out an important observation about the method but doesn't elaborate.

Can we control the number of distribution set for each class? What if you select only few number of distribution set?\" \n\nFirst, I check if it's an explicit or implicit action. The reviewer is directly asking about the number of distribution sets, which is a clear action. So it's explicit. Next, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking a specific question about controlling the number, which gives a clear direction on how to modify the draft. So it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nMoving on to **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"the choice of 20 distribution sets\" and asks about controlling the number. They're specifically referring to a part of the paper, so that's fully grounded. They also clearly specify what needs to be addressed, which is the number of distribution sets per class. So this is 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting a change (controlling the number of distribution sets). The justification is asking for a solution, which is a logical request. There's no external reference, but the reasoning is clear and logical. So it's somewhat verifiable, but since the reasoning is solid, maybe it's 4. Wait, no, the justification is logical and clear, so it's fully verifiable. So verifiability is 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking specific questions about the number of distribution sets, which is a clear improvement area. The questions are actionable and directly address a potential modification. This provides the authors with clear guidance on how to adjust their work.

The explicit action is to showcase with new models, which is clear. But the review doesn't specify how to implement this, like which datasets or exact improvements. So it's explicit but lacks detail. That makes it somewhat actionable, so I'd give it a 3.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review points out that the experiments are on n-gram HMM and RNN, which are outdated. It then suggests using transformer-based models, which are current. The grounding is clear because it references specific types of models. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, so it's fully grounded and specific. That should be a 5.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that the authors should use newer models.

It's unclear how to estimate it. Now, is this an explicit action? The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't suggesting a solution. So it's not explicit. Is it implicit? Well, the reviewer is implying that the authors need to address this issue but isn't giving a clear direction. So it's more implicit. Now, is it concrete?

Therefore, this is borderline actionable because it's implicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions mu as the proportion of missing observations. That's pretty specific. They're not just talking about missing data in general but specifically about the proportion. So the grounding is full because they can pinpoint the issue. Then, they explain what's wrong with it, which is specific. So this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is making a claim that mu can't be estimated as the proportion of missing observations. They need to back this up. Is there supporting evidence? Well, the reviewer is suggesting that it's unclear, which is a judgment. They might need to reference some literature or common knowledge about missing data mechanisms. But the review doesn't provide specific references or logical reasoning. So it's somewhat verifiable because there's a claim but no strong justification.\n\nHelpfulness.

Well, it doesn't specify how to apply this information. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a **Borderline Actionable** score.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The comment mentions METEOR, which is a known metric, so it's grounded. It's also specific because it refers to a well-known evaluation metric.

It also states that this depends on availability to the environment or a good OPE method. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the reviewer is pointing out that these hyperparameters need tuning, which is an explicit action. However, the explanation is a bit vague\u2014it doesn't specify exactly how to implement the tuning or what methods to use. So, it's not fully actionable because the details are missing.

The explicitness here is clear, but the concreteness is lacking. The review doesn't specify exactly how to reproduce the models or the exact parameters to use, so it's a bit vague. So, I think this is borderline actionable because it does suggest an action but doesn't provide detailed guidance.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to pillow et al.'s GLM and mentions specific regularization methods. It accurately points out the differences, so the grounding is full. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being discussed, which is the GLM from pillow et al., and explains what was done differently.

It also asks if the method should be tested on non-deterministic domains for empirical evaluation and mentions that BEAR isn't in the baselines. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the suggestions are explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out specific scenarios and suggesting experiments, which is explicit.

It mentions specific roles between winners and cooperators and how lower costs might blur these roles, affecting collective return. The comment is explicit about the analysis needed, so that's clear. It also provides a concrete direction on what to study, so I think this is actionable. It doesn't seem vague or unclear, so I'd rate this as 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about roles between winners and cooperators and how costs affect them. It's pretty specific about the type of analysis needed, mentioning \u03b1 values and collective return. It doesn't just say \"further analysis\" but gives clear parameters, so this is fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that studying incentivization costs would be helpful. It supports this claim by suggesting specific scenarios (different \u03b1 values) and explaining the potential outcomes. It's logical and provides examples, so this is fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out specific areas for analysis and the potential implications of cost changes.

It also recommends using an additional page instead of adding more experiments. The action here is clear: revise the description. However, the instructions say that if the action is vague, it's considered borderline. The comment doesn't specify how to revise it, like whether to reorganize sections or add more details. So, it's explicit in suggesting an action but vague on the specifics.

It doesn't specify which part of the description is unclear or where exactly the extra page should be used. The grounding is weak because it's making an educated guess about where the issue lies without pinpointing the exact section or detail. So, this is **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the description is difficult to follow and suggesting a structural change.

So, this is highly actionable because it's explicit and concrete. So, actionability should be 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions Figures 1-9 but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're in. It's just a general statement. So, the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. That's weak grounding because it's not specific. They don't know which section to focus on. So, grounding_specificity is 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that adding experimental settings will make the figures convincing. But does it support this claim? It doesn't cite any external references or provide logical reasoning. It's just a statement. So, it's not verifiable. Maybe it's borderline because it's a claim without support, so verifiability would be 2.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out the missing data and suggests adding it, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the highest. Maybe a 4 because it's helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 5, grounding 3, verifiability 2, and helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It also points out that some methods leverage sparsity. The comment is explicit about the action of avoiding hindrance, so that's explicit. But it doesn't give specific steps on how to implement pathway protection. So, it's explicit but vague on the action. That would be 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to activation channels in deep networks, which is specific. It mentions sparsity, which is a clear point in the paper. So, the grounding is full because it accurately points to the part of the paper being discussed. The specificity is also good because it clearly states what's wrong with the methods. So, this would be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment suggests that some methods leverage sparsity but doesn't provide evidence or references. It's making a judgment that some methods are tailored, but without supporting details. So, it's somewhat verifiable. That would be 3: Somewhat Verifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness.

It suggests using other statistics like the median instead of mean. The comment is explicit about the issue (ad-hoc regularization) and provides a clear action (suggesting alternative statistics). It also gives concrete details on how to implement this by mentioning the median. So, this is highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to the regularization term and mentions the mean and standard deviation. It doesn't explicitly point to a specific part of the paper, but it's clear that the issue is with the regularization method. The specificity is good because it suggests alternative statistics, which are specific to the method discussed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment makes a claim that the regularization is ad-hoc and lacks support. It provides some reasoning about the mean's sensitivity to outliers but doesn't cite external references. It's somewhat verifiable because there's some justification, but it's not as robust as it could be.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a clear issue with the regularization method and suggests improvements. It's helpful because it guides the authors to consider alternative statistics, which can enhance their model.

That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions \"existing fairness algorithms\" and \"state-of-the-art fairness algorithms.\" It doesn't point to specific sections or tables in the paper, so the grounding is weak.

The comment directly states the potential issue and the contradiction, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It mentions specific tasks where Transformer-M performs poorly and the contradiction with the paper's claim.

The specificity is also high because it explains what's wrong in detail.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment makes a claim that there's a contradiction, which is verifiable by looking at QM9 results.

I guess you want to write that the sum of the 'optimistic' hoped for rewards is close to the expected actual rewards.\" It seems like it's pointing out that the term \"is sufficient\" is vague and suggests the reviewer wants a more precise explanation. Is this an explicit action? The reviewer is asking for clarification, which is a direct action. But is it concrete? The reviewer isn't giving specific steps or how to improve it, just asking for more detail. So I think it's somewhat actionable because it's explicit, but vague on how to apply the change. Maybe a 3?\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is pointing out an issue at specific line numbers, L240 and L428. So they're accurately pinpointing the location. That's full grounding because they're referring to specific sections. Then, they explain what the problem is, which is about the term \"sufficient\" being vague. So they're specific about what needs to be addressed. That should be fully grounded and specific, giving a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that \"is sufficient\" needs clarification. They're asking for more details, which is a claim. But is there any supporting evidence? They're just asking for more information, which is a bit vague. There's no logical reasoning or references provided. So this might be borderline verifiable, maybe a 2.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking for clarification on a specific point, which is helpful. They're pointing out an area where the authors can improve by being more precise. It's clear and actionable in that it requires the authors to seek more information. So this should be highly helpful, a 5.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, the claim is that the term is vague, but there's no justification or references. So maybe it's borderline. But since they're asking for clarification, it's a bit more than just a claim. Maybe 3? Or 2? I'm a bit unsure here. But I think since they're asking for more details, it's somewhat verifiable because they're implying the need for clarification, which is a form of justification.

It also suggests looking for sample complexity results. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The review does suggest specific areas for improvement and provides some direction, like looking for sample complexity results. However, it's a bit vague on exactly how to implement these suggestions. For example, it doesn't specify which parts of the algorithm to analyze or how to calculate sample complexity. So, it's explicit in pointing out the need for improvement but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.

So this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions L29, which was previously careful, and asks about experiments. It's specific about the part of the paper (L29) and what needs to be done. So the grounding is full, and the specificity is high. That's a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the paper should have considered distribution changes. It's suggesting experiments, which requires justification. The justification is logical but maybe not very detailed. It's somewhat verifiable because it's clear and logical, but perhaps lacks specific references. So maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking for experiments, which is a direct suggestion. It's clear and provides a direction for improvement. So it's highly helpful, a 5.\n\nI think each aspect is quite high, so all scores should be 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review says that the proposed method uses AdamW with cosine LR, while comparing methods use Adam with fixed LR. It argues that directly comparing with their numbers is unfair. The suggestion is to reproduce results using the same setting. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors to use the same settings. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It suggests using the same hyperparameters, which gives a clear action. So I think this is highly actionable because it provides a specific fix.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions AdamW and cosine LR, which are specific optimization methods. It also suggests reproducing results with the same settings, which is a clear reference to the paper's methods. So the grounding is explicit and clear, meaning it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a judgment that the comparison is unfair and suggests a better approach. It's a claim because it's stating an opinion that the current comparison is unfair. The justification is that most recent methods have released their code, implying that a fairer comparison would be to use the same settings. This is supported by external knowledge (recently released codes), so it's verifiable.\n\nHelpfulness. The review points out a specific issue and provides a clear suggestion to fix it. It's actionable, grounded, and well-supported. This should be highly helpful as it guides the authors to adjust their comparison method, which is a meaningful improvement.\n\nSo putting it all together, each aspect scores 5 because they are all highly actionable, grounded, verifiable, and helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests improvements but doesn't tell the author exactly what to do. For example, it says the colors are hard to distinguish but doesn't recommend switching to a different color palette. It also points out the axis labels but doesn't specify how to fix them. So, while it's clear what's wrong, the suggestions are vague. I think this falls under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does explicitly state the issues but lacks concrete steps on how to fix them.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like the plots, and clearly states what's wrong with them. It doesn't just say \"the plots are bad\" but details the exact issues, like color choices and labeling. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the sections being discussed. I'd rate this as **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the plots are unclear and suggests improvements. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up why the plots are problematic. It's more of a critique without evidence, so I think this is **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification or support given for the claims made.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are quite general and don't provide specific fixes. While it's better than nothing, it could be more helpful if it offered more concrete advice.

The action is concrete because it tells the authors exactly what's missing and what they should do. So, this seems highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Table 1 specifically, so that's full grounding.

It mentions putting more focus on the IEM in Fig 3 and improving Figs 7. The suggestions are clear, but are they explicit? The reviewer is telling the authors exactly what to do, so that's explicit. Now, are these actions concrete? The reviewer is giving specific figures to focus on and suggesting improvements, so yes, the actions are concrete.

They're not just talking about the paper in general but pointing out particular sections. So the grounding is explicit and clear, meaning the authors can easily identify which parts need improvement. This is fully grounded and specific, so a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the structure, focus on certain figures, and improving visualizations. Each of these claims is supported by general knowledge about academic writing and figure presentation. There's no need for external references or logical reasoning beyond common practices, but the claims are justified. So this is somewhat verifiable, but since the reasoning is clear and based on common knowledge, it's probably a 4. However, since the reasoning is solid, maybe it's a 5. Wait, the instructions say to rate verifiability based on how well the claim is supported. Since the claims are based on general knowledge, it's somewhat verifiable, but perhaps a 4 because it's not as robust as external references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer provides specific suggestions about structure, figures, and visualizations. These are actionable and directly address areas the author might need to improve. The suggestions are clear and would help the author make meaningful changes. So this is highly helpful, a 5.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, I'm a bit unsure. The claims are based on common knowledge, so maybe it's a 4 because it's somewhat verifiable but not as strong as having external references.

That would be a 2 for grounding specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the analysis is unclear and suggests a comparison. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's not verifiable.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out three specific issues: how the focal stack is synthesized, the forward model of using a defocus map and image, and handling depth discontinuities at edges. Each of these is an explicit action the authors should take. The comments are clear and direct, so they're actionable. There's no need for the authors to infer anything; the suggestions are straightforward. So, this should be a high actionable score, probably 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific technical aspects of the method, like the focal stack and defocus map. It accurately points out parts of the paper that need clarification. The grounding is strong because it refers to specific methods and potential edge cases, which helps the authors know exactly where to look. So, this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides clear explanations of the issues. It suggests looking into the forward model and handling depth discontinuities, which are well-supported by common knowledge in image processing. There's no need for external references, as these are standard topics. The explanations are logical and sufficient, so this should be a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is very specific and provides actionable suggestions. It addresses multiple technical points without being vague. The feedback is clear and directly useful for the authors, so it's highly helpful. This also gets a 5.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is scored 5 because the review is explicit, well-grounded, verifiable, and highly helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

The explicit action is to include a comparison, but it doesn't specify how to do it, like whether it's a minor point or how significant it is. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 4: Mostly Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about transferring GCG's approach to other LLMs. It doesn't mention specific sections or tables, just generally says \"other LLMs.\" So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific part. The specificity about the jailbreaking percentage is also weak because it's just a minor point without clear details. So, this would be a 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that GCG's approach could be transferred, which is a subjective opinion. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers a suggestion to include a comparison but doesn't specify how or why it's important.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review suggests the authors introduce a novel approach, which is good, but the reviewer is confused about the difference between similarity and exit times. The reviewer asks for a detailed explanation. Now, is this actionable? Well, the reviewer is asking for more details, which is a clear action. But is it explicit? Yes, they're asking for a detailed explanation. Is it concrete? The reviewer wants a clear understanding, so the action is specific. So, this seems to be highly actionable because it's a direct request for information without ambiguity.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer is asking about two specific terms: similarity and exit times. They mention these terms, so the comment is grounded because it's referring to specific parts of the paper. The specificity is also good because the reviewer is clear about what they need explained. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is asking for an explanation, which is a claim. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is asking for a more detailed explanation, which is a subjective request. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided. So, it's not verifiable because it's more of a request than a claim supported by evidence. Therefore, this might be unverifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer is asking for a detailed explanation to understand the difference. This is helpful because it provides a clear suggestion for the authors to improve their understanding. It's somewhat specific but not the most detailed. So, it's somewhat helpful.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, since the reviewer is asking for an explanation, it's a claim without any supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable. That makes sense because it's a request rather than a statement that needs justification.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nActionability: 5 (highly actionable)\nGrounding Specificity: 5 (fully grounded and specific)\nVerifiability: 1 (unverifiable)\nHelpfulness: 3 (somewhat helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It's suggesting whether the framework can handle any general POMDP, including continuous or infinite spaces. The comment is asking a question, which is a form of explicit action\u2014suggesting the authors explore this limitation. However, it's more of a probing question rather than a direct instruction on what to do. So, it's explicit but doesn't provide concrete steps. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear the author wants the authors to look into it, but it's vague on how to proceed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is asking about the framework's applicability to general POMDPs, which is a specific part of the paper. It's clear which part they're referring to, so the grounding is strong. Additionally, the comment is specific about the limitations, so it's providing clear information about what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the framework can't handle all POMDPs.

It also talks about finetuning a pre-trained model on synthetic data. I think the explicit action here is to add these discussions and finetune, which are clear actions. But how detailed are these actions? The review doesn't specify exactly how to add the discussions or what hyperparameters to use for finetuning. So, it's explicit in terms of what to do but lacks concrete details on how to implement it.

The reviewer is suggesting that the scale impacts accuracy, implying that the proposed method's superiority is due to the new large dataset. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is making a claim about dataset size affecting performance, which is an explicit statement. But they don't tell the authors exactly what to do next. They're pointing out a potential issue but not providing a direct fix.

It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. But is it concrete? The comment doesn't tell the authors how to sparsify or how to compare accuracy. It just gives the idea.

It's specific about which part of the paper to look at, so grounding is good. It also clearly states what needs to be compared, which is specific. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to the section and clearly explains the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion, so it's a claim. It needs to be supported. However, the review doesn't provide any justification or references. It just says to sparsify and compare. Without supporting evidence, it's **1: Unverifiable** because there's no backing for why this action would help or how it's justified.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment suggests an improvement but doesn't provide much detail. It's vague about how sparsifying affects accuracy and doesn't offer any rationale for why this is a good idea.

It mentions specific questions like how the sparsification process works, how to generate landmarks on edges, deciding the number of landmarks, types of image features, fixed radius with scales, and shape invariance. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives explicit instructions or if it's vague. The reviewer lists several specific questions, which suggests they are pointing out areas where the paper needs improvement. However, these are more like questions rather than clear instructions on what to do. So, it's not giving explicit actions but rather pointing out issues. That might make it somewhat actionable but not fully. Maybe a 3 or 4?\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific technical aspects like sparsification, landmark generation, and feature extraction. It clearly identifies the sections of the paper that need improvement, so the grounding is strong. The reviewer isn't just talking about the paper in general but points to specific parts, which is good. So, this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\n**Verifiability**: The review contains claims about the lack of detail and the need for specific technical details. It's supported by the fact that these are well-known issues in reproducibility, so it's verifiable. The reasoning is clear, pointing out common challenges in research. So, this should be a high score, perhaps 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer provides a lot of specific questions and areas for improvement. While it's helpful, it could be more detailed. For example, suggesting alternative methods or providing references might make it even more helpful. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most.

It gives an example about recent chunks having temporary high utility leading to premature evictions. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with the approach, which is an explicit action. But does it give clear guidance on what the authors should do? It suggests that they should consider other factors beyond utility, but it doesn't specify what those factors are. So it's explicit but vague. \n\nSo, on the actionability scale, it's probably a 3 because it's explicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about FIITED's approach and gives an example. It mentions \"recent chunks\" and \"temporarily high utility.\" It doesn't explicitly name a specific part of the paper, like a section or table, so the grounding is weak. However, it does imply the issue through examples, which is a form of grounding. \n\nSo, grounding specificity would be a 4 because it's weakly grounded but provides some specificity through examples.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that using utility scores could introduce bias.

So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it tells the authors what to do but doesn't give precise steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out that the framework's performance isn't clear. It mentions adding quantitative experiments and comparisons, which are specific parts of the paper. The grounding here is clear because it directly references the experimental aspects and the comparison between algorithms.

It mentions uncertainty about the model's ability but doesn't suggest any specific changes or actions. So, it's not explicit or vague. It's more of a statement of uncertainty without providing direction. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about a model's potential but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a general statement about the model's capabilities without pointing to a specific section or data. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part.

It also points out unfair comparisons. I think this is explicit because it directly states why the model is needed and what's wrong with the comparison. But is it concrete? It tells the authors what's wrong but doesn't specify how to fix it. So, it's explicit but vague. That would make it a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions the adversarial network, CAT, GAN, and pre-trained models. It clearly identifies specific parts of the paper, so that's fully grounded. It also explains what's wrong with these parts, which is specific. So, this should be a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that the model's size is a problem and that comparisons are unfair.

It also suggests more elaboration. Is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out the confusion and asking for clarification, which is explicit. But does it give a clear action? It's more of a question, so maybe it's implicit. It's vague because it doesn't specify how to clarify or what exactly needs to be elaborated. So, I think it's borderline actionable.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The reviewer talks about the concept of state, which is a specific part of the paper. They mention elements, states, and actions, which are specific terms. So, they've identified the part of the paper and what's wrong. That's fully grounded because they're pinpointing the section and the issue clearly.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting that elements are equivalent to states or actions. The reviewer is making a judgment about the paper's clarity. Now, is this claim supported? The reviewer is pointing out a lack of clarity, which is a common knowledge point. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's a recognized issue, but there's no external reference or specific examples provided.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is clear about the issue and asks for clarification. It provides a suggestion to elaborate, which is helpful. It's not vague, so it's somewhat helpful.

It suggests comparing the proposed method with these existing ones. Now, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The review does state an action\u2014comparing with other methods\u2014but it's a bit vague. It doesn't tell exactly how to do the comparison, like whether it's a figure, discussion, or something else. So, it's not fully actionable because the method of comparison isn't specified. Maybe it's implicit, so it might fall under borderline actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions specific methods and references a section, so it's clearly pointing out specific parts of the paper. That means the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the referenced sections. It's not just a general statement; it's specific enough for the authors to look into those parts.\n\nVerifiability. The review makes a claim by suggesting a comparison with existing methods.

The review mentions that the comparison is unfair but doesn't specify how to fix it or what changes are needed. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit comment, which means it's not actionable. So, I think this is borderline actionable because it does suggest an issue but doesn't tell the authors how to address it. Maybe a 2 or 3?\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about Pix3D but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's referring to. It just says \"the experiments are conducted on Pix3D.\" So, the grounding is weak because it's not specific about the sections or parts of the paper. It's more of a general statement without pinpointing the issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be weakly grounded and not specific, maybe a 2.\n\nFor verifiability, the review makes a claim that the comparison is unfair. It needs to be supported. The reviewer mentions that zero-shot models are worse, but doesn't provide evidence or reasoning. It's vague and lacks justification. So, it's borderline verifiable, maybe a 2 or 3. It doesn't cite any external references or logical reasoning, so it's not fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem with the comparison but doesn't offer specific solutions or how to improve the model. It's clear that the comparison is unfair, but it doesn't guide the authors on what changes to make. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. Maybe a 3 or 4. It's not the most helpful because it doesn't provide actionable steps, but it does identify an issue.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores are: actionability 2, grounding_specificity 2, verifiability 2, helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review says, \"Additional experiments on realistic noisy datasets like WebVision would have provided more support for C2D.\" The action here is suggesting adding experiments, which is explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? It just says \"additional experiments,\" which is pretty vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know what specific changes to make. So, I think this is borderline actionable. Maybe a 3 or 2. But since it's explicit, maybe 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"realistic noisy datasets like WebVision.\" WebVision is a specific dataset, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where to add experiments. That's full grounding because it's clearly referencing a specific part of the paper. Then, it specifies what needs to be done, which is adding experiments. So, grounding_specificity would be 5 because it's both grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a suggestion, so it's a claim. It says \"would have provided more support,\" which is a judgment. Now, is this claim verifiable? The reviewer is suggesting that adding such experiments would support C2D, but they don't provide any evidence or references to back this up. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it's unverifiable. Maybe a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment suggests adding experiments but doesn't explain why or how it would help. It's vague and doesn't provide concrete reasons. So, it's not very helpful. Maybe a 2 because it's better than nothing but could be improved.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Actionability: explicit but vague, so 3. Grounding: fully grounded and specific, 5. Verifiability: no support, 1. Helpfulness: suggests improvement but lacks detail, so 2.

That would make it **Borderline Actionable** because it's not entirely clear what action to take.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer is pointing out specific issues with the tasks, like multiple rows and changing factors, but they don't name a particular part of the paper. They're making a general comment about the tasks being confusing. So, the grounding is weak because they're not pinpointing an exact section or figure. It's just a general critique, so **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is asking for proof but doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning. They're just expressing doubt, which is a claim, but without justification. So, it's **Unverifiable** because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is raising valid concerns and suggesting improvements, which is helpful. It gives the authors a direction to look for evidence and possibly refine their tasks.

It seems like it's pointing out a problem but doesn't tell the authors what to do. So it's not explicit. Is it implicit? Well, it's suggesting that visualization is needed, but it's vague on how to add it. So it's implicit but vague. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it implies an action but doesn't specify how to implement it.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment mentions \"intermediate processes and comparisons.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or which figures/tables. So the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded because it's too vague. Also, it doesn't provide specific examples or mention external work, so it's not specific either. So this is weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim because it's suggesting that there's a lack of visualization, which is an opinion. Now, is this claim supported? It's a general statement about the paper, so it doesn't reference any specific literature or examples. It's more of a general observation without justification. So it's not fully verifiable.

So, it's borderline actionable because it's explicit but lacks detail on how to apply the fix.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to $\\mathcal{P}_2$ from Definition 1, which I assume is a specific part of the paper. So, the author can pinpoint exactly where the issue is, which is good grounding. It's clear what part is being addressed, so I'd say fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment claims that the counterfactual violates $\\mathcal{P}_2$, but it doesn't provide any justification or references.

It doesn't specify what the author should do next. So, it's not giving an explicit action or a clear method. It's more of a question without a direct answer, which makes it borderline actionable because it could be inferred, but it's not very detailed. So, I'd rate this as 2.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions \"the grid search of learning rate\" and \"validation set.\" It's pretty specific about the part of the paper it's addressing because it's referring to a particular hyperparameter tuning method. It doesn't make any general comments or guess which part to focus on. So, this is fully grounded because it clearly points to a specific section or method. The specificity is high because it's not just mentioning a part of the paper but a specific technique within it. So, I'd give this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by asking whether the grid search is done on the validation set. It's a clear statement, and the reasoning is logical\u2014asking about the standard practice. There's no need for external references because it's a common knowledge point in machine learning. So, this is fully verifiable. I'd score this as 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a minor problem by asking about the validation set usage during grid search.

It doesn't just say \"the figures need improvement\" but specifically points out what's lacking. It also talks about colors in the figures, which is a specific element. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections and the specific issues within them.

The action here is suggesting a change, which is explicit. But does it give clear instructions on how to do that? It just says \"turk\" and \"generate more feedback,\" which are vague actions.

The review is pointing to a specific line number, so the author can identify exactly where it's referring. That's full grounding because it's precise. Then, it's asking about the feature extractor, which is a specific part of the methodology. So, the specificity is good because it's clear what's being asked.

However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly what changes the authors should make.

The comment suggests that the paper only uses MULT as a baseline, which is somewhat specific. However, it doesn't provide explicit instructions on what changes the authors should make. It's vague because it doesn't specify how to improve upon MULT or what aspects are lacking. So, this is borderline actionable because it hints at a problem but doesn't give clear steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to MULT by name, which is specific, and mentions the year, adding a bit more context. It doesn't point to a particular section or figure in the paper, so the grounding is weak. The specificity is okay because it mentions the baseline, but it doesn't explain what's wrong with it in detail.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment states that MULT was proposed in 2019, which is a fact. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's unverifiable. There's no logical reasoning or external sources cited, making it hard to verify the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out that MULT is outdated and suggests it's the only baseline considered. While it gives a reason to improve, it's vague about what changes to make.

The review does state what the undefined variables are, which is explicit. However, it doesn't provide specific instructions on how to address these undefined variables. It just mentions the problem without giving clear steps or actions the authors should take. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete guidance. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to W1 and W2 as the Encoder and Decoder networks but doesn't specify which part of the paper these correspond to.

So, this should be a high score on actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions a specific paper, Foester et al., which helps the authors pinpoint where to look. It's not just a general statement but provides a concrete reference. So, this is fully grounded and specific, giving the authors a clear starting point.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review points to a specific paper as evidence.

The reviewer does suggest a comparison between two methods, which is a clear action. However, the explanation is quite vague. They don't explain why Importance Sampling wasn't used or provide details on how \u03b2 affects the method. So, it's explicit in terms of what to do but lacks specifics on how to implement it.

So, it's implicit. Since it's not explicit, it's not actionable because the authors don't know how to fix it. So, this is borderline actionable because it's implicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions overfitting with limited data and differentiable augmentation. They don't specify which part of the paper or section they're referring to. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. They mention the area but don't give a clear reference, so it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the contribution is not enough and that the factors mentioned are important but limited. They don't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's a subjective opinion without justification, so it's not verifiable. It's borderline because it's a claim but lacks support.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer points out a limitation but doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements.

It's more of a request for more information rather than a direct instruction on what to do. So, it's explicit but vague on how to apply the action. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is asking about the state-space, actions, and theta. It's not referencing a specific part of the paper; it's a general question. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded. But it's also not specific about what needs to be addressed. So, this would be a 2 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review is making a judgment about the need for more details and asking for clarification. It's a claim that more details are needed. Is this justified? Well, it's a request, but it's not supported by external references or logical reasoning beyond the need for clarity. So, it's somewhat justified but lacks depth.

It then points out that for geometrically distinctive concepts, DINO representations are good, but for those where class labels are more semantic than geometric, the authors' concern is valid. The reviewer is asking for clarification, which is an explicit action. However, the action is vague because it doesn't provide specific steps or how to verify this. So, it's not fully actionable.

They're pinning down specific parts of the paper, like DINO and the distinction between geometry and semantics. That's pretty grounded because they're referencing specific elements.

It's general, so the grounding is weak. The comment doesn't clearly identify the specific aspect of the paper being discussed, so it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests testing few-shot approaches and including discourse relations. Testing few-shot approaches is a common practice in machine learning, so that's verifiable. Including discourse relations is a known method, so that's also verifiable. Therefore, the verifiability is good because it's supported by common knowledge.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out specific issues the authors should consider, like the GPT baseline and few-shot approaches.

The reviewer isn't just saying \"improve clarity,\" they're giving a precise example of what to include. So, this seems like an explicit action with concrete details.

Analyzing previous work does not constitute as a contribution.\" The first part, \"It is unclear what the major contributions are,\" is a statement of fact, but the second part, \"Analyzing previous work does not constitute as a contribution,\" is a suggestion. So, the reviewer is giving an explicit action: pointing out that analyzing previous work isn't a contribution. That's direct, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly what to do\u2014they should check if their work adds something new beyond existing research. So, this is highly actionable.

It's specific about the lack of contribution from previous work, which is actionable. The feedback is clear and directly useful for the authors. It's helpful but could be expanded, so it's somewhat helpful. Helpfulness score: 4.\n\nWait, but for grounding_specificity, the comment doesn't specify which part is unclear, so it's not grounded.

It mentions that it's a common approach in semi-supervised learning. Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. The comment explicitly states that the method is not novel, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't give any specific steps on what the authors should do next. It just points out that it's similar to existing methods. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details on how to improve. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it does state an action but doesn't tell exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions self-training methods in semi-supervised learning. That's a specific part of the field, so the grounding is good. They clearly identify the related method, which means the comment is grounded.

The reviewer isn't giving a specific action beyond mentioning the concern, so it's not fully actionable. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does explicitly state the concern but doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to address it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to the dropout probe and its impact on sensitivity. It mentions a causal role and a potential concern about false positives. The reviewer is addressing a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is clear. They also specify what the concern is about, which is the trade-off between sensitivity and false positives. This makes the grounding quite specific. So, I think this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately identifies the section and clearly states the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment contains a claim that the dropout probe increases the risk of false positives. The reviewer suggests this should be discussed. To verify this claim, we need to know if this is a well-known issue in dropout techniques. From what I know, this is a recognized concern, so the claim is supported by common knowledge. Therefore, the verifiability is **5: Fully Verifiable** because it's backed by established understanding.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential concern, which is valuable feedback. It suggests that this should be discussed, providing a clear improvement area. While it's helpful, it might not cover all possible implications, so it's somewhat incomplete. However, it's still useful and actionable. I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful** because it offers clear feedback and suggests an improvement, though it could be expanded.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 5\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at a problem but doesn't tell the authors how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions the meta sampler but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's vague about the exact section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the authors only use the meta sampler in a decoupled way. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence to support this claim. There's no reference to external literature or logical reasoning, so it's borderline unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential improvement area but doesn't offer specific suggestions or details. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much. So, it's barely helpful because it identifies a problem but doesn't guide the authors on how to address it.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is only partially addressed, so the scores are 2 for each.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

It also provides a citation. The explicit action here is pointing out the lack of specific fairness metrics. However, the suggestion to follow an external paper is vague and doesn't provide concrete steps on how to implement the changes. So, it's not fully actionable because the action isn't detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"fairness-aware metrics like Equality odds (EO)\" which is specific. It also cites an external paper, making it grounded. The specificity is good because it clearly mentions the metrics and provides a reference, which helps the authors understand what needs improvement.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that the authors are lacking specific fairness metrics. It supports this claim by citing an external paper, which is a form of justification. However, the justification is somewhat vague and doesn't provide detailed reasoning or examples, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a deficiency and provides a citation, which is helpful.

The comment is explicit about the issue and provides a clear action, which is to either move it or remove it. It doesn't just point out the problem but gives a direct solution. So, this seems highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do. I think this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions L107-114 but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper that is. It just says \"this part\" or \"the paper.\" So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or element.

It mentions that different hyperparameter sets are used per dataset, which isn't ideal. The action here is clear: authors should provide insights. But the review doesn't specify how to do this, like suggesting specific methods or tools. So it's explicit in stating the action but lacks detail on how to implement it. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the value of neighborhood size h and its influence on the model's performance. It mentions that h is the key parameter and provides readers with insights. The grounding is explicit because it mentions the specific parameter h and its impact.

It points out that computing this accurately is as hard as solving the ridge regression problem, which might defeat the purpose. However, it doesn't explicitly tell the authors how to proceed or what changes they should make. It's more of an observation rather than a direct action. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to address this themselves. Maybe it's a bit implicit, but not clear. I think this is a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it suggests a problem but doesn't provide explicit steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about the statistical dimension d_lambda and mentions that it can't be computed without solving ridge regression. It's clear which part of the paper it's referring to\u2014design matrix A and ridge regression. It also explains why computing d_lambda is difficult, which helps the authors pinpoint the issue. So, it's well-grounded because it accurately identifies the sections and explains the problem clearly. I'd rate this a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that knowing d_lambda is necessary but can't be computed accurately without solving ridge regression, which might defeat the purpose. It supports this claim by explaining the difficulty of computing d_lambda and its relation to ridge regression. This provides logical reasoning and connects it to known concepts, making the claim verifiable.

It provides some guidance but doesn't explicitly state how to implement the changes, like whether to use k-cross-validation or what loss functions to try. So, it's not fully actionable because the steps aren't clearly outlined.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out specific issues like glove embedding similarity and suggests trying other loss functions. It clearly references specific parts of the paper, so this is fully grounded. The specificity is high because it directly addresses the mentioned issues without needing further clarification.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting trying other loss functions and mentions Eq3.

It also asks about probabilities and hypothesis space. The explicitness here is high because it directly points out missing information and suggests specific actions like explaining the grammar, probabilities, and inference. The concreteness is also good because it doesn't just say something is missing but asks for specifics on how to address it.

It's somewhat helpful but could be more comprehensive, so it's a 4/5.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at least 4/5, but since the review is quite detailed, I'll go with 5 for all except maybe grounding specificity. Wait, no, grounding is fully grounded and specific, so it's 5. Actionability is highly actionable, so 5. Verifiability is mostly verifiable, so 4. Helpfulness is highly helpful, so 5.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that if it's borderline, think about whether it helps authors. The review is quite clear, so I think all are 5 except maybe verifiability. But no, the reasoning is solid, so 4 for verifiability.

So, this is borderline actionable because it's vague on the implementation steps.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer talks about other works in the related work section.

It doesn't make any general claims or imply other parts, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is about the neighboring nodes, which is clear. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that only neighboring nodes are attended to. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's just a statement without support.

The comment states that the contrastive learning framework is the same as SimCLR. This is a direct statement, so it's explicit. However, it doesn't provide any specific actions or guidance on how to improve the paper. It just points out a similarity. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. Therefore, it's borderline actionable since it's explicit but lacks detail on how to apply it.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment mentions SimCLR, which is a specific framework, so it's fully grounded. It clearly identifies the referenced part, which is good. But it doesn't specify what's wrong or how it affects the paper. It just states a fact, so it's specific in grounding but not in detailing the issue.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim because it's making a judgment that contrastive learning is the same as SimCLR. It needs verification. The comment doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's unverifiable. There's no supporting evidence, making it hard for the authors to assess the claim's validity.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment points out a similarity but doesn't offer any actionable feedback or suggestions. It's vague and lacks clarity, so it's barely helpful. The authors don't know how this similarity impacts their work or what changes they should make.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are: Actionability 2, Grounding Specificity 5, Verifiability 1, Helpfulness 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Alright, I need to evaluate the given review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions referencing Zemel et al. (2013) and explains how the current paper differs, with comparisons in simulations. It suggests making comparisons more systematic by comparing the best performance of each method. The explicit action is to improve the systematic comparison, and the concrete details provided are about comparing the best performances. So, this is highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review explicitly mentions Zemel et al. (2013) and suggests comparing the best performances. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, which is the comparison methods, and specifies what needs improvement. Therefore, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides a clear claim to improve systematic comparisons and supports it by suggesting a specific method (comparing best performances). It doesn't require external references, so it's well-supported, making it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers specific, actionable feedback on how to improve the comparison methods. It suggests a clear next step without being vague. This makes it highly helpful as it directly addresses the authors' needs for improvement.\n\nSo, all aspects are scored as 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says the time complexity should be estimated to prove scalability. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. But is it concrete? It suggests estimating time complexity, which is a clear action. So I think this is highly actionable because it's explicit and gives a direct instruction.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions time complexity but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where to focus. It's a general statement, so the grounding is weak. The authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies, which makes it less specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting estimating time complexity to prove scalability. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's unverifiable. There's no justification given, which means the authors won't know how to proceed beyond the suggestion.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is clear and suggests a specific improvement, so it's somewhat helpful. However, since it's vague about how to estimate time complexity or what data to use, it's not fully helpful. The authors might not have enough guidance to act on it effectively.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests looking into universal kernels and references a specific chapter. It doesn't explicitly tell the author what to do, like adding or modifying something. So it's not giving a clear action, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. Maybe a 3 or 4?\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions a specific chapter, which is good. It's not just a vague idea but points to a particular section. So this should be fully grounded. The specificity is also high because it's clear what part is being discussed. So maybe a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting a connection to universal kernels. It references a specific chapter, which is a solid justification. So this should be fully verifiable, maybe a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The suggestion is to look into a specific chapter, which is a resource. It's helpful because it guides the author to additional information. It's not the most detailed, but it's better than nothing. So maybe a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores would be: actionability 3, grounding 5, verifiability 5, helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}
