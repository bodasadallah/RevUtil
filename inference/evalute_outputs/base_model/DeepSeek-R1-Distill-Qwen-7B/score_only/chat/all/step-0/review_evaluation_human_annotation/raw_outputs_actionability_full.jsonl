The review points out that the author didn't consider the AND operator or element-wise max, which are related to union and intersection. The reviewer is asking why the chosen options (OR and MIN) were better. The comment is suggesting an alternative approach. Is this explicit? Yes, it's directly telling the author to consider other operations. So that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking why the chosen options are better, but they don't specify how to apply this. It's more of a suggestion without detailed guidance. So I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is talking about operators and their mathematical meanings, not directly pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's more about the methodology rather than a specific section or figure. So the grounding is weak because it's not clearly referencing a part of the paper. I'd give this a 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that the author should consider other operations. Is this claim supported? The reviewer is pointing out that using AND and MAX might not capture the intended union and intersection, which is a valid claim. The reasoning is logical, comparing the chosen operators to the intended ones. So this is well-supported, making it fully verifiable. I'll score this as 5: Fully Verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

It suggests this might introduce noise. The comment is explicit about the issue and provides a clear explanation of why it's a problem. It also gives a concrete example of how this could introduce noise. So, this is both explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review clearly mentions the specific part of the paper being discussed, which is the description of HIERENC. It also explains what the issue is, so the grounding is explicit and specific. Therefore, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that averaging all possible instantiations introduces noise.

The reviewer is making a suggestion to mention Li et al. (2019a) earlier, which is explicit. However, the comment doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement this change. It just suggests revising the description. So, it's explicit in terms of the action but vague on the details.

It's a clear question, so it's explicit. But does it give any guidance on how to improve? It just asks a question, so it's not providing actionable steps. So, it's not highly actionable. Maybe it's somewhat actionable because it's asking a direct question, but without any suggestions, it's more like a clarifying question.

The review is asking how to interpret these results. \n\nIs this an explicit or implicit action? Well, it's giving a comparison and an interpretation, but it's not telling the authors exactly what to do. It's more of a statement of findings rather than a direct instruction.

It's a bit vague. I think the comment is pointing out a potential issue but doesn't give a clear action or solution. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe it's borderline because it does suggest a problem but lacks detail on how to fix it. So, I'd rate it as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions noun phrases but doesn't specify which part of the paper or exactly what's being addressed. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where the issue lies beyond noun phrases. So, it's not fully grounded. Maybe it's 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific? Wait, no. If it's vague about the part addressed, it's weakly grounded. But since it's not clear what's missing, it's not specific either. Hmm, maybe 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since it's not pinpointing the section, maybe it's 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the current method isn't sufficient when the head isn't a pronoun. It's a claim, and it's supported by the authors' proposed method. The reasoning is logical, pointing out the limitation. So, it's thoroughly supported. I'd give it a 5: Fully Verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out a limitation but doesn't provide a solution or further guidance. It's clear and identifies an issue, but without suggesting how to handle it, it's somewhat helpful. So, maybe a 3: Somewhat Helpful.\n\nWait, but the helpfulness could be better because it does identify a problem. Maybe it's 4: Mostly Helpful since it's clear and identifies an issue, even if it doesn't provide a solution. Alternatively, since it's only pointing out a problem without a fix, it's somewhat helpful. I think 4 is better because it's clear and actionable in terms of pointing out an area for improvement.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nActionability: 3  \nGrounding Specificity: 2  \nVerifiability: 5  \nHelpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It provides an explicit action by pointing out the MST baseline and mentions that more baselines should be included. However, it doesn't give concrete details on how to implement these changes, like specific modifications or where to add the baselines. So, it's explicit but lacks detail. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review does mention the MST baseline, which is specific. It also talks about related work baselines, which should be clearly identifiable. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the sections and provides clear guidance on what needs to be added. That's a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting the MST baseline and the need for more baselines. It supports this with general reasoning about the importance of including more baselines but doesn't cite specific external references or provide detailed justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable, which is a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about the need for more comparisons and suggests specific baselines.

It also asks readers to understand how stable points in probabilistic metric space are obtained, which might be necessary to repeat the results. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The comment is asking for something, which is an action, so it's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? Not really. It just suggests adding more discussions and explaining the convergence part. So, it's explicit in terms of what needs to be done but vague on the specifics. That would make it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions the convergence of the joint learning process and the stable points in probabilistic metric space. It's clear which part of the paper it's referring to, so the grounding is strong. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the convergence and the stable points. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the necessity of explaining these concepts to repeat the results.

So it's somewhat justified but not fully. \n\nI think this would be **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some reasoning but it's not robust or detailed enough.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer provides specific weaknesses and suggests areas for improvement. They're pointing out both the limitations of the experiments and the potential of the method beyond the current scope. This is clear and actionable, so it should be **5: Highly Helpful** because it gives the authors a lot to consider and improve upon.\n\nWait, but the verifiability was only 3, so maybe the helpfulness is a bit higher because the suggestions are more concrete. Hmm, but helpfulness is subjective. Since the suggestions are clear and specific, I'll stick with 5 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests that treating concept map extraction as a separate task might be necessary. It mentions that many systems build knowledge graphs and generate summaries, but as the number of nodes increases, it becomes harder to distinguish concepts, making general summaries more readable. The comment is pointing out a problem ( difficulty in distinguishing concepts) and suggesting a solution (treating it as a separate task). It's explicit about the solution, so that's good. It also explains why the problem is an issue\u2014because of increasing nodes and readability. So, the action is clear, and the explanation is concrete. That should be a high score on actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions \"concept map extraction\" and talks about the increase in node numbers making it hard to distinguish. It's specific about the task and the issue, so the grounding is strong. It's not just a general statement but directly addresses a part of the paper, which is good. The specificity is also clear because it's pointing out a particular challenge in the method.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that as the number of nodes increases, it becomes harder to distinguish concepts. It's not providing external references or logical reasoning beyond that. It's a bit vague because it doesn't explain why exactly it's hard or how it affects the summary. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. Maybe a medium score here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a problem and suggesting a solution, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, so it should be considered highly helpful. The suggestions are specific about treating concept map extraction as a separate task, which gives the authors a clear direction.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores would be: actionability 5, grounding 5, verifiability 3, and helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It asks if the experts are linguistic or domain experts, whether annotation differs from non-experts, and if it introduces linguistic challenges. \n\nLooking at the explicitness, the review is clear and specific. It doesn't just suggest something; it asks direct questions about the nature of the experts and the annotation process. That's explicit. Now, for concreteness, it provides clear guidance on what to include: traits of experts, justification beyond commercial value, and whether annotation differs or introduces challenges. So it's not vague. Therefore, this should be **4: Mostly Actionable** because it's explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"experts\" in general, but it doesn't specify whether they're linguistic or domain experts. It also doesn't mention any specific traits or challenges. So the grounding is weak because it's too vague. The authors might not know exactly which part of the paper to address. Therefore, this should be **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review doesn't make any claims. It's more of a directive asking questions rather than stating an opinion or judgment. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiability.

The reviewer isn't giving a specific action like adding a figure or rewriting a section. They're just stating a desire for examples. So, is this explicit or implicit? Since it's a suggestion without specifics, I think it's implicit. Now, is it concrete? No, because it doesn't tell the author exactly what to do. So, this is borderline actionable because it's an implicit action but lacks detail.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"examples of the system on actual texts\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where to add them. It's unclear which section or figure they're referring to. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint exactly where the examples should be. They might have to guess, which isn't ideal.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review is making a suggestion, so it's a claim. But there's no justification or evidence provided. They're just recommending examples without backing it up.

However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. For line 397, they need to state the pooling method, but the review doesn't specify whether it's mean, max, etc. For equation 472, they need to clarify whether E_i is a type or identity, but again, the review doesn't provide guidance on how to do that.

It doesn't just refer to the paper in general but points to exact spots. So, this is fully grounded because it accurately identifies the parts of the paper being discussed. The specificity is also good because it explains exactly what's wrong with those parts. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains claims about the issues needing attention. It's not just a statement; it's pointing out specific problems. The justification is provided by the authors' own work, as they need to define the pooling method and clarify the equation. There's no external reference needed here, but the reasoning is clear and logical.

They mention it's not grounded because they don't point out the exact section or element. So, the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the referenced part. The specificity is also low because they don't explain what's wrong in detail. So, this should be a lower score.

That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because the action is clear, but the specifics are missing.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"existing detection methods\" but doesn't specify which ones. It's a general statement, so the grounding is weak. The comment doesn't point to a specific part of the paper or provide clear examples, making it **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that the performance comes mainly from the first step. It's a subjective opinion, so it's a claim. The justification provided is vague\u2014it doesn't explain why the first step is the main contributor or provide evidence. There's no reference to external literature or logical reasoning, so it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some justification but lacks key elements like examples or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out that the authors' results are not convincing because the performance is mainly from the first step. It suggests comparing with existing methods, which is helpful. However, the suggestion is somewhat vague, and the overall critique is a bit generic. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful** because it provides some meaningful feedback but isn't the most detailed or comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 3\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still have to figure out how to conduct an ablation study with a different dataset. Therefore, it's borderline actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding_specificity. The reviewer mentions using another dataset but doesn't specify which one. They refer to Tanks & Temples and ETH3D, but it's not clear if these are sections, tables, or unique elements in the paper. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. They're making a general suggestion without clearly identifying the part of the paper being addressed.\n\nVerifiability. The claim here is that the original claim is valid, and the reviewer is suggesting another dataset. The suggestion is based on common knowledge about ablation studies and the availability of these datasets. It's supported by general knowledge and doesn't require external references, so it's somewhat verifiable. There's a clear justification but maybe not enough depth.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer is questioning the claim and suggesting a specific change, which is helpful. They're pointing out a potential improvement area and guiding the authors to consider a different approach. This provides clear feedback and direction, so it's somewhat helpful but could be expanded for more depth.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 3 because they're all in the middle of the scale. The review is helpful but not the most detailed, the grounding isn't fully there, the verifiability is there but not the strongest, and the actionability is there but not explicit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the authors consider a single vulnerability at a time, acknowledge data imbalance, and questions the ecological validity. It also points out that previous work considers multiple vulnerabilities. The reviewer is suggesting that the authors should argue if identifying one at a time is an intended use case. \n\nIs this explicit? The reviewer is making a suggestion about the authors' approach, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is pointing out that previous work considers multiple vulnerabilities, which gives the authors a clear direction on what they should do. So, I think this is actionable because the reviewer is not just asking for more information but suggesting a specific improvement.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions specific aspects like data imbalance, multiple vulnerabilities, and whether the authors are arguing for a specific use case. They're not just talking about the paper in general but are pinning down specific sections or elements. So, the grounding is strong because they're clearly pointing to these specific points in the paper. The specificity is also good because they're not just saying \"the paper is unclear\" but are giving examples of what needs to be addressed.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is making a claim that the authors should consider multiple vulnerabilities. They back this up by referencing previous work and suggesting that the authors should argue if their approach is an intended use case. This is supported by external references (previous work) and logical reasoning about why considering multiple vulnerabilities is better. So, this is fully verifiable because the reasoning is clear and supported by examples.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is providing clear feedback on the authors' methodology, suggesting improvements, and referencing previous work. This is helpful because it guides the authors on what needs to be addressed and why. It's not just vague advice but specific suggestions that can help the authors improve their study.

It supports this with the theorems, which are well-known, so it's thoroughly justified.

It suggests that this would lead to impractically large learning rates. The comment is explicit about the issue, so that's good. It also provides some guidance on why this is a problem, which is helpful. However, it doesn't give specific steps on how to adjust the learning rate or what alternative approaches to consider. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. I think this makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it points out the problem clearly but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the required condition on the learning rate and mentions that it's not scalable. It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a particular section or figure. It's a bit vague in terms of pinpointing the exact issue. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. Therefore, this would be **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the required condition isn't realistic because in practice, the step size doesn't grow with the sample size. It provides some reasoning about the implications of this, but it's not very detailed. There's a logical argument about scalability, but it's not backed by specific references or examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. This would score as **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a significant issue with the learning rate condition and suggests that it's unrealistic. It's clear and raises important concerns that would help the authors improve their work.

The suggestions are actionable and directly address the issue, making it highly helpful.\n\nSo, all four aspects are scored as 5 because each part of the review point is explicit, well-grounded, verifiable, and helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that when using the same time-step for training and evaluation, Figure 5 shows similar performance between the baseline and the time-aware model. It questions the effectiveness of the proposed methods and suggests that under different time-step scenarios, the method might make more sense. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a scenario where the method doesn't perform better, but they're not explicitly telling the authors what to change or how to improve. They're more asking for a different setup. So, it's not giving a direct action, which makes it somewhat vague. I think this falls under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because they do suggest an action (testing different time-steps), but it's not very detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to Figure 5 and mentions different time-step scenarios. It seems like they can identify the specific part of the paper (Figure 5) and the issue with the time-step alignment. They're not just making a general comment but specifically pointing out a part of the paper and a particular issue. So, this should be **4: Fully Grounded and Specific** because they clearly pinpoint the figure and the problem.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the effectiveness is questionable under certain conditions. They're suggesting that the method might make more sense in different scenarios. The justification here is that they're relying on their own reasoning and the observed similar performance. They don't cite external references or provide logical reasoning beyond their own analysis. So, this is **2: Borderline Verifiable** because they do provide some reasoning but it's not as strong as a full justification.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a limitation but is somewhat vague. It suggests trying different time-steps but doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to do that or what changes to expect. It's helpful in highlighting a potential issue but lacks depth. So, this should be **3: Somewhat Helpful** because it does provide some insight but isn't comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 4\n- Verifiability: 2\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

The comment suggests this is an implicit action, which is to compare the parameter counts. However, it doesn't specify how to do this comparison, like whether it's more parameters or fewer, or what the implications are. So it's not explicit, and the action is vague.

It would be valuable to discuss it and present your solutions in this paper. The citation seems a bit disordered.\" \n\nFirst, the comment is asking the authors to discuss different input types and present solutions. That's an explicit action because it tells them what to do. But then it mentions the citation being disordered. The problem is, the comment doesn't tell the authors how to fix the citation. It just points out that the citation is disordered. So, the action is explicit, but the implementation is vague. That makes it borderline actionable because they know what's wrong but not how to fix it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about different types of inputs, like biomedical signals or speech. It uses examples, so that's explicit grounding. It also mentions the citation being disordered, which is a specific part of the paper. So, the grounding is pretty solid here. They pinpoint the issue clearly.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that the citation is disordered. To verify this, we need to know why the citation is disordered.

It also mentions that the improvement in Table 5 isn't significant on some datasets, like OfficeHome, where the improvement is marginal. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if this comment is explicit and concrete. The comment is making a connection between equations, which is a bit abstract. It's not directly telling the authors what to do, like suggesting a change or a specific fix. Instead, it's pointing out a relationship between equations and noting a lack of significant improvement. So, it's more of an implicit suggestion rather than an explicit action. Therefore, it's not highly actionable because the authors still have to figure out how to connect the equations or interpret the results themselves. Maybe it's somewhat actionable if they take note, but it's vague on how to apply it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to Eq.4 and Eq.3, which are equations in the paper. It also mentions specific datasets like OfficeHome and the models CSAC and the proposed solution. So, the authors can identify exactly which part of the paper is being discussed\u2014equations and a specific table. Additionally, it's clear what the issue is: the improvement isn't significant. So, the grounding is strong because it's specific and refers to exact parts of the paper.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment is making a claim that Eq.4 implies u^l in Eq.3 is 1, and that the improvement is marginal. To verify this, we'd need to look at the equations and the experimental results. Since the reviewer is pointing out that the improvement is small, this is a claim that can be supported by referencing the data from Table 5. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a basis in the data, but it's not fully detailed. The reasoning is clear, but maybe lacks specific references or examples.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out a specific finding in the results, which could be helpful for the authors to know where their work isn't making a significant impact.

It doesn't just suggest something vague; it tells the authors exactly what to do. So, this seems highly actionable. I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about model AUC, calibration curves, and comparing with traditional methods. It mentions specific parts of the paper like the agreement between predicted scores and actual risk. The authors can pinpoint exactly where to focus their work, so this is fully grounded. It's not just a general comment; it's very specific about the sections or aspects of the paper. So, I'd rate this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides clear justifications. It explains why calibration curves are important and how they show consistency. It also suggests comparing with traditional methods, which is a logical step. There are no vague claims or missing references. The reasoning is solid, so this is fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review offers specific, actionable feedback on the model's AUC limitations and suggests practical steps like calibration curves and comparisons. It's not just pointing out a problem but providing clear solutions. This should be highly helpful for the authors. So, a 5 here as well.\n\nOverall, the review point is comprehensive and provides clear guidance, making it very helpful and grounded. It's also highly actionable and verifiable, so all aspects are top-notch.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It doesn't give specific actions or solutions, so it's not actionable. It's more of a statement than an actionable suggestion. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability because it's not helpful for the authors to act on.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Section 4.3 about presentation bits leading to representation bits but doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to.

Also, they're not providing specific examples or pointing out issues in a specific area. So, this is weakly grounded and not specific, which is a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim that the approach isn't suitable for large problems. Is this claim supported? Well, it's a general statement about the limitations of LP-solvers. There's no external reference or specific reasoning provided. It's more of an opinion than a fact, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a limitation, which is helpful because it gives the authors something to consider. However, the feedback is quite general and doesn't provide specific suggestions on how to handle large problems. It's somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are: actionability 2, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It doesn't clearly identify the issue or the part needing improvement.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a judgment about the practicality of using f_R/f_P without domain knowledge. It references the impracticality of learning without data, which is a logical reasoning point. It's somewhat verifiable because it explains why domain knowledge is beneficial but doesn't provide specific external references or examples.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment offers a valid point about the practicality of f_R/f_P, which is helpful for the authors to consider.

It mentions that there are no experiments on difficulties in obtaining data or how performance changes with data size. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives explicit or implicit actions. The comment suggests that experiments are needed but doesn't specify what to do next. It's more of an implicit suggestion. Also, it's vague about what experiments to conduct or how to measure performance. So, it's not explicit, and the action isn't detailed. That would be a **Borderline Actionable** (2) because it hints at an action but doesn't provide clear steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about labeled data and solving problems but doesn't specify which part of the paper or data it's referring to. It's too vague about the exact sections or issues. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the referenced part. The specificity about what's wrong isn't clear either. Therefore, this is **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** (2).\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that experiments are needed but doesn't support it with any evidence or reasoning. It's just stating a fact without justification.

It also points out that the authors acknowledge this in the conclusion but questions it. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives explicit instructions on what the authors should do. The review suggests looking into generalization bounds but doesn't specify how or where to apply this. It's more of an implicit suggestion. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to connect their constructions to generalization bounds.

It's not fully grounded since it's too broad.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review makes a claim that the constructions of ReLU networks for robust memorization don't lead to robust generalization. It then asks if this is a serious question, implying that the authors need to justify their approach. However, the justification is vague and lacks specific references or examples. It's more of a general statement without concrete evidence or citations, so it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but it's not robust or detailed enough.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review raises a valid concern about the relationship between overparameterization and generalization. It acknowledges the authors' work but points out a potential gap. This provides some value to the authors by highlighting an area that needs exploration. However, it's not very detailed and doesn't offer specific suggestions on how to address this issue.

It mentions that this would improve prox-linear algorithms for the stochastic problem. The comment is explicit about the reformulation, so that's clear. It also provides a concrete action by stating how to improve the algorithms. So, this seems highly actionable because the reviewer is giving a specific method and the steps are clear. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer refers to Eq.(1) and Algorithm 1 by name, which means they are accurately pinpointing the specific parts of the paper.

Here, the reviewer is pointing out a relationship between two concepts but doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They're making a connection but not guiding them on how to apply it or where to look. So, this is more of an implicit suggestion.

They mention a teacher network being uniformly distributed and temperature set to 1. This seems pretty specific because they're pinning down exact conditions.

It then provides specific examples, like questions about converting a stacked LSTM to a sequential one and an unclear sentence about hierarchical layers. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does give specific questions, which are explicit. However, the questions are quite detailed and might require the author to infer how to address them.

It's just recommending changes but doesn't back it up with references or logical reasoning. So there's no verifiability here. It's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a problem and suggesting a fix, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, though maybe a bit vague. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive. That would be a 3 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding specificity 2, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It says this choice isn't well motivated and asks why this particular difficulty is interesting. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a method (using CIFAR images) and questioning its motivation. It's explicit because it's directly talking about the method. However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't provide specific steps or how to improve it. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what's being done but lacks detail on how to apply the change.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to \"CIFAR images\" as the background. It's specific about the type of images but doesn't mention anything else about the paper, like sections or unique aspects. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the referenced part (CIFAR images) without needing more context. The specificity is about the type of images, which is clear, so it's \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the choice of CIFAR images is not well motivated. It's a claim because it's an opinion or judgment. The justification is that it's not well motivated, but it doesn't provide specific references or examples. So, it's somewhat justified but lacks depth. I think this is \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because there's a basis for the claim but not enough evidence to fully support it.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is asking a question about why this difficulty is interesting. It's somewhat helpful because it does point out a potential weakness in the methodology. However, it's not very detailed and doesn't provide actionable suggestions.

It points out that minimizing the averaged loss doesn't ensure flatness and suggests adding analysis on the noise-injected models. This is explicit, so it's not implicit. The suggestion is clear, so it's concrete. Therefore, it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to the loss used for training, specifically Eq (3), and mentions noise-injected models. It accurately points out the missing analysis, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is high because it clearly states what's missing and what needs to be added.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that minimizing the averaged loss doesn't ensure flatness. It supports this with logical reasoning about the relationship between loss minimization and flatness. It references Eq (3) and noise-injected models, which are external references.

The explicit action here is suggesting a change, so that's clear. The comment also provides concrete details on how to apply the change, like comparing sizes. So this seems actionable and concrete. I think this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to the figure and labels but doesn't specify which exact part. It just says \"the text inside the figure and the labels.\" That's a bit vague. It doesn't point to a specific section or element, so the grounding isn't fully there.

It's specific about the figure and the elements within it. The reviewer isn't making general comments but is pointing to a particular part of the paper. So, the grounding is full because it accurately points to Figure 3.

It also asks for a justification of the benefit of their method. The comment is explicit about the need for a comparison and justification, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement this comparison or what kind of justification is needed. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. That would fall under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to PhaseNet-Das and mentions the need for a proof of concept and future applications. It clearly points out a specific part of the paper (the existing detectors) and what needs to be addressed (comparison and justification). So, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the referenced part. Additionally, it specifies what needs to be done, which adds to the specificity. Therefore, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests a comparison and asks for justification. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's relying on the authors to figure it out. This means there's no external support, making it \"Unverifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out an existing method and asking for a comparison, which is helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point says, \"Why the results of Table 6 is not aligned with Table 1 (MCT-pair)? Also what about the ablation studies of MCT without the adaptive metrics.\" \n\nFirst, I check if it's an explicit action. The reviewer is asking a question, which is a common way to prompt the author to explain. So, it's explicit because they're asking for an explanation. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking about the misalignment and also about ablation studies. They're not giving specific instructions on what to do next, like suggesting a fix or a specific analysis. So, it's a bit vague. Therefore, this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks concrete steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions Table 6 and Table 1, specifically referring to MCT-pair, and also ablation studies without adaptive metrics. This means they're pointing out specific sections and concepts, which is a strong form of grounding. They're not just talking about the tables in general but specifically which ones and what they're looking at. So, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific** because they're clearly pinpointing the parts of the paper.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by pointing out a discrepancy between two tables and suggesting looking into ablation studies. This is a claim because they're making an observation and suggesting further analysis. Now, is this claim well-supported? They're not providing any evidence or reasoning; they're just stating that there's a discrepancy and suggesting looking into something else. There's no justification or references provided. So, this is **Unverifiable** because the claim is made without supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking a question and suggesting another area to look into. While this provides some guidance, it's quite vague. The authors might not know exactly how to address the misalignment or what specific changes to make in the ablation studies. This doesn't give them a clear path forward, so it's not highly helpful. It's more of a starting point than a detailed suggestion. Therefore, this is **Somewhat Helpful** because it does identify an issue but doesn't provide enough actionable steps or justification.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: Somewhat Actionable (3)\n- Grounding Specificity: Fully Grounded and Specific (5)\n- Verifiability: Unverifiable (1)\n- Helpfulness: Somewhat Helpful (3)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Unverifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

It also cites specific papers, which means it's clearly pointing out specific parts of the paper. So, it's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review does cite external references, which provides some support.

It doesn't specify what needs to be done, like suggesting specific changes or improvements. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of a general statement, which makes it borderline actionable because it hints at an action but doesn't detail how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It talks about the sub-tasks in general, not pointing out which section or aspect of the paper is problematic. So, the grounding is weak because it can't confidently identify the referenced part.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just a statement that the sub-tasks are simple, but there's no supporting reasoning or references.

It then asks if extending to longer subsequences is straightforward. The action here is suggesting an extension, but it's vague. It doesn't tell the author exactly how to do it or what changes are needed. So, it's implicit because the author has to infer, which makes it less actionable. Therefore, it's probably a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions triplets and sliding windows but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's unclear, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the issue, so it's a 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting an extension.

It also mentions that the work is missing related work but doesn't negate its novelty. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The comment is asking a question, which is explicit, but it's more of a clarification than a direct action. It doesn't tell the author what to do next, just what to look for. So, it's not fully actionable because the author still has to figure out where to look for related work on their own. Therefore, it's probably a 3: Somewhat Actionable because it does explicitly ask about the sequence but doesn't provide detailed steps on how to implement that.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is pointing out a specific concept in the paper, \"sequence of episodes,\" and is asking about the types. It's clear which part it's addressing, so that's fully grounded. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, which is the types of sequences. So, this should be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific because it accurately identifies the section and clearly states what's needed.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is making a judgment about the paper's missing related work. It's a claim because it's suggesting that the author's work is missing something. Now, is this claim verifiable? The comment doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's just a statement without support. Therefore, it's 1: Unverifiable because there's no evidence or reasoning backing up the claim that related work is missing.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

This is an explicit statement, so it's clear what the reviewer is pointing out. Additionally, the reviewer provides a concrete reason why it's not an ablation study by stating that they didn't remove any component. So, this is both explicit and concrete. Therefore, it should be highly actionable because the author can directly apply this feedback to their work.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"the study about different subdomain sizes\" and specifies that it's not an ablation study. They also explain why by saying they didn't remove any component. This clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being discussed and explains the issue. So, the grounding is full because they accurately pinpoint the section and provide a clear reason. Therefore, this review is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the study isn't an ablation study. They support this by stating that they didn't remove any component of the method. This explanation is logical and provides a clear justification, so the claim is thoroughly supported. Hence, this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is clear and directly addresses a potential misunderstanding about the study's nature. They provide a reason why it's not an ablation study, which is helpful for the author to understand the context of their work.

But the instruction is more of a question rather than a clear action. The reviewer is asking a question, which might imply they're unsure about the suggestion. So, it's not explicit; it's more of an implicit suggestion. Therefore, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to implement it. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is talking about including AccNet as part of a larger predictor for semantic segmentation. They mention \"a larger predictor\" and \"similar operators.\" This clearly references a specific part of the paper, like a section discussing predictors or operators. They're not just making a general comment but specifically pointing to where AccNet could be applied. So, the grounding is strong because they're pinning it down to a specific area. But they also mention \"e.g., for semantic segmentation,\" which is a general example. However, the main point is about the larger predictor, so I think the grounding is solid. Maybe it's 4: Fully Grounded and Under-Specific because they do mention the larger context but could be more specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is suggesting adding AccNet as part of a larger model. This is a claim because they're making a suggestion. Now, is this claim well-supported? They're asking a question, which is more of a suggestion without providing evidence or reasoning. There's no reference to external works or logical reasoning here. So, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe it's 2: Borderline Verifiable because they're making a suggestion but not providing much justification.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking a question about including AccNet in a larger model for semantic segmentation. This is a suggestion but is quite vague. The authors would need more concrete information on how to integrate AccNet or why it would be beneficial. Since it's a question without clear guidance, it's not highly helpful. Maybe a 3: Somewhat Helpful because it does suggest an improvement area but lacks depth.\n\nWait, but for grounding_specificity, I thought it was 4, but maybe it's 3 because the example is too general. Let me reconsider. They mention \"a larger predictor\" which is specific, but the example is \"for semantic segmentation,\" which is a general use case. So, it's somewhat specific but not fully.

It mentions that other 3D CNNs like X3D and SlowFast have been proposed to reduce computation. The reviewer is asking if the proposed method works on these and what the advantage is. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is suggesting a comparison but not directly telling the authors what to do. They're implying that using other models could be better but aren't clear on how to implement that. So, it's implicit because the authors have to infer that they should test their method against X3D and SlowFast.

It's pointing out that the explanation is unclear and wants more details like the number of modules, their placement, etc. Now, is this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is giving a question, which is a direct action, so it's explicit. But is it concrete? The reviewer isn't providing any specific details, just asking for more information. So it's explicit but vague. That would make it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is asking about the ResNet-20 architecture, which is a specific part of the paper. They're not making educated guesses but are clearly pointing to a specific section. So the grounding is full. However, they're not specifying what exactly is wrong with the attention module's integration. They're asking for details, which is clear about what needs to be addressed. So this is **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that the explanation is unclear.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point is asking about the performance difference from using different image sizes and ResNet variations. It's a good question, but is it explicit? The reviewer is suggesting a follow-up experiment, which is an action. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to measure the difference or what metrics to use. So, it's not fully actionable because the author still needs to figure out the exact steps, making it borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper, L170, which is about performance differences. They're asking about image sizes and ResNet variations, which are specific technical aspects. They're not just making a general comment but directly referencing a part of the methodology or results. So, this is fully grounded because they're clearly pointing to a specific section and what's being discussed there.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment about the impact of these changes. They're asking if the performance difference can be known, which is a claim. The justification here is that they're asking for a quantitative assessment, which is a common request. It's somewhat verifiable because they're referencing a specific metric (performance difference) but don't provide external references or detailed reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking a question that could be very useful for the authors. It's a clear suggestion to conduct further experiments, which is helpful. However, it's somewhat vague because it doesn't specify how to measure the difference or what experiments to run. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be: Actionability 3, Grounding Specificity 5, Verifiability 4, and Helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It doesn't leave room for interpretation, so that's concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review talks about presenting the algorithm in detail. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly the algorithm is located. It's a general suggestion. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't point to a specific section or figure. It's not fully grounded. Since it's not specific about what needs to be addressed, it's not fully specific either. So, this would be weakly grounded and not specific, which is a 3.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review is making a claim by suggesting that the algorithm should be detailed. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

It's also specific about what needs to be done, which makes it well-grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting a specific improvement. It's supported by common knowledge about the benefits of runtime comparisons. So, it's well-justified and verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and directly addresses a potential improvement.

It suggests the author explore other datasets. Is this explicit? Yes, it tells the author what to do. Is it concrete? It suggests exploring other datasets but doesn't specify how, like whether to try data augmentation or different architectures. So it's explicit but not very concrete. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR10. It's clear which datasets are being referred to, so the grounding is full. It also explains why natural images are better, which adds specificity. So this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the method doesn't work on natural images. It's a claim, and it's supported by the fact that the method was tested on MNIST and SVHN. There's no external reference or examples, but it's logical.

The comment suggests improvements but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done. It's vague in terms of actions. So, it's not explicit, which makes it less actionable. Therefore, it's probably a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to tables 6 and 7, which are specific parts of the paper. It mentions the prompts not being well-organized, so it accurately identifies the issue. This is fully grounded because it points to specific sections. However, it doesn't specify what needs to be done about the squeezing of sentences, so it's not very specific. So, grounding_specificity would be a 4.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment about the organization of the prompts and the style design. It's not providing any evidence or references to back up these claims. It's a subjective judgment without justification. Therefore, it's unverifiable, scoring a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out specific issues in the paper, which is helpful. However, it's vague about the exact changes needed. It doesn't provide clear suggestions or examples, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully comprehensive.

It mentions specific issues like unclear relations between sub-figures and missing labels. Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. The comment is explicit about the problems, so that's good. It doesn't just say \"the figures are unclear\"; it points out specific examples. That makes it actionable because the authors can know exactly where to focus their improvements. Also, the suggestions are concrete\u2014like mentioning specific modules that should be labeled. So, this seems highly actionable. I think it's a 5 here.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment talks about figure 2 and mentions specific sub-figures and modules. It doesn't just say \"the figures are unclear\" but points to exact issues. So, the authors can pinpoint where the problems are. It's not vague or too general. Therefore, this is fully grounded because it clearly references the specific part of the paper. The specificity is also good because it explains what needs to be addressed. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the figures are unclear and suggests improvements. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up why the figures are unclear. It's more of a statement of observation rather than a claim that needs justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. Maybe a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out specific issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it doesn't offer much depth or alternative solutions. It's somewhat vague in terms of how to improve the figures beyond just saying they need to be clearer.

It doesn't just suggest a change but also provides context, so it's not vague. I think this is highly actionable because it gives clear directions.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to FFNs and linear decomposition, which are specific technical terms. It doesn't just say \"a problem exists\" but mentions the specific reason and possible solutions. It accurately points to the part of the paper, so this is fully grounded and specific. The authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue lies and what might be a solution.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review mentions existing work and poses a question if such work doesn't exist. It's making a claim by suggesting that someone might have solved this, and it's supported by pointing to relevant literature. It's somewhat verifiable because it references potential solutions but doesn't provide specific references.

It doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's addressing, like a specific section or figure. It's talking about general issues without pinning down the exact area. So, the grounding is weak because it's not specific to a particular part of the paper.

Here, the reviewer is pointing out a problem and giving specific areas to improve. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It says to add more details and references, which is explicit. However, it doesn't specify how to implement these additions, like whether they should be integrated in a certain way or how to structure the paragraph. So, it's explicit but not very detailed on the action. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specifics on how to apply it.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions specific methods like sparse-attention and references [1,2], etc. So, they are clearly pointing out specific parts of the Related Work section that need improvement.

It says it's hard to understand under what conditions to use SynTextBench. So, the action here is suggesting a comparison and asking for conditions. Is this explicit? Yes, they're directly telling the authors to compare metrics. Is it concrete? They mention specific metrics like MMLU and Big Bench, so the authors know exactly what to look into. So, this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about a large body of work on LLM evaluation and suggests a specific comparison. It mentions well-known metrics, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where to focus. This is fully grounded because they're referring to specific metrics and the conditions are clear. So, **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that SynTextBench should be compared with other metrics and suggests conditions for use. The justification is that it's hard to understand when to use SynTextBench, which provides some support but isn't very detailed. It's somewhat justified but lacks specific references or examples.

I would expect that the associated reports would be significantly easier than including all reports.\" The reviewer is pointing out a limitation in the methodology. They're suggesting that only segments with a single label are considered, which might make the analysis easier. \n\nIs this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is asking a question, which implies they want the authors to consider segments with multiple labels. So, it's an explicit suggestion. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking for an explanation of why single-label segments are easier, but they don't provide specific steps or how to implement this. It's more of a directive without detailed guidance. So, it's explicit but vague. That would make it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is talking about ECG segments with one label. They mention \"segments with one label assigned to them\" and \"the associated reports.\" This seems pretty specific because they're referring to a particular aspect of the analysis. They're not making general comments but are pointing out a specific part of the methodology. So, the grounding is clear and specific. That would be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a statement about why single-label segments are easier. They're suggesting that including all reports would be more difficult. Is this a claim? Yes, it's a judgment about the ease of analysis. Now, is this claim supported? The reviewer is explaining their reasoning, saying that single-label segments are easier, which is a logical argument.

It gives specific examples like discretization schedules or modifications. That seems explicit. The action is clear: try these other methods. The specificity is good because it mentions different aspects and references specific literature.

This is an explicit action, so it's clear what needs to be done. However, it doesn't specify how to provide the conclusion or summary, like whether it should be a paragraph, bullet points, or something else. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on the method.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests that analyzing Adam under (L0,L1)-smoothness is not clear and that one can directly apply standard analysis. It recommends explaining the challenges and differences from Zhang et al. Now, is this explicit? Yes, it tells the authors what to do. Is it concrete? It mentions explaining challenges and differences, so the authors know exactly what to focus on. So this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about challenges and differences with Zhang et al. It doesn't explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, but it's clear which areas it's referring to. So the grounding is strong because it's obvious which part is being discussed. Therefore, **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review points out that standard analysis can be applied, implying that the challenges are known. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the implication. So it's somewhat supported but lacks depth. Maybe a **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about the need to explain challenges and differences. It provides a clear suggestion, which is helpful. It doesn't seem vague or lacking in guidance. So this should be **5: Highly Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are all 5s except verifiability, which is 3. Wait, no, the review doesn't cite any external sources or provide detailed reasoning, so maybe verifiability is lower. Let me double-check. The comment doesn't cite Zhang or provide a logical explanation beyond the implication. So verifiability is **2: Borderline Verifiable** because it's clear the standard analysis applies, but the reasoning is vague. Hmm, but the comment does suggest explaining challenges, which is a clear action, so maybe it's still somewhat verifiable. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe it's **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because it's clear the standard analysis applies, but the reasoning is not detailed. Alternatively, if it's clear that standard analysis applies, that's a form of grounding, but for verifiability, it's about justification. Since it's not providing specific references or detailed reasoning, maybe it's borderline. I'll go with **2: Borderline Verifiable**.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

They're also pointing out a grammatical error, which is another explicit action. So, the reviewer is giving clear instructions on how to modify the text and correct a mistake. That seems actionable because the author can directly apply these changes. So, I think this is highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The reviewer mentions \"TopoNet [24]\" which is a specific citation, so the author can pinpoint where the issue is. They also talk about a grammatical error, which is a general point but still specific enough. So, the grounding is solid because it clearly references the paper and the issue. I'd rate this a 5 as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer provides a specific reference [24] to explain why the neural network doesn't memorize exact critical points. They also mention a grammatical error, which is a common knowledge point. The explanation is clear and supported by external references, so this is fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer gives clear, actionable feedback on both the citation and the grammatical error. They also suggest improving the method section's conciseness and checking for errors, which are both useful for the author. The feedback is detailed and constructive, so it's highly helpful.

It mentions specific techniques like two-step methods and end-to-end combinations. The reviewer is clearly pointing out specific parts of the paper, so the grounding is strong. They're not just making a general statement; they're referring to particular methods.

I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's explicit but vague on the implementation.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It just says to add a sentence in Section 3.2. Without more details, the authors might have to guess where exactly to add it or what to write.

The reviewer then asks about switching BPE types. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions. The reviewer is pointing out that the comparison is overrated and lists other models, which is explicit. However, the specific action is to ask a question about BPE types. It's not giving a direct action like suggesting a change or providing data. So, it's more of an implicit action. Therefore, it's not highly actionable because the action isn't explicit.

It mentions that the authors' problem is reductionist and brings up human cognition, but it's unclear what the authors mean by their statement. The reviewer suggests that the interaction between cognitively basic mechanisms and the CPR structure might have a bigger effect than previously thought. They also mention that behavioral economists studying this would likely ignore these things and need citations for comparison. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out an area for improvement but isn't giving a direct action. They're suggesting the authors should consider these factors but aren't telling them exactly what to do. So, it's more implicit. Also, the advice is vague because it doesn't specify how to incorporate these mechanisms or where to find relevant citations. So, it's not very actionable.

The reviewer is pointing out that the problem is reductionist, which is a valid point, and suggesting that behavioral economists might not consider these factors.

It's also not concrete because it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. So, this is borderline actionable because it implies an action but lacks specifics. I think that's a 3.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions combining the contributions but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It's a general suggestion, so the authors can't pinpoint where exactly the combination should happen. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't reference a specific section or figure. It's also not specific about what needs to be changed. So, this is weakly grounded and not specific. That would be a 2.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a judgment that combining the contributions would improve the paper. It's a claim because it's an opinion or suggestion. Now, is this justified? The review doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning to support why combining the contributions is beneficial. It's just a statement of what would be good. So, it's unverifiable because there's no backing for the claim. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review suggests combining two points but doesn't explain why or how. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps. The authors won't know what exactly to do, so it's not very helpful. It's barely helpful because it does identify an area for improvement but lacks depth and clarity. So, that's a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 2, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the paper targets a problem somewhat differing from general segmentation problems and appreciates the potential benefit to the neuroscience community. It then asks about the improvement over existing solutions and the need to refer to more recent trends. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review provides clear instructions for the authors. The comment here is more of a question rather than a directive. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do or how to improve. So, it's not fully actionable. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which would fall under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's vague on how to apply the action. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to the paper's problem being somewhat different from general segmentation and mentions the neuroscience community as a plus. It then asks about comparing with existing solutions and refers to recent trends. \n\nThe grounding part here is about how specific the comment is about the paper. The review does mention the problem's difference and the community, but it's not very specific about which part of the paper needs improvement. It's more general, so the grounding is weak. However, it does specify that the authors need to refer to recent trends, which is specific about what needs to be done. So, it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it's not confidently pinpointing the exact part but does clearly state what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting that the paper needs to compare with existing solutions and refer to recent trends. It then provides some reasoning, like the importance of demonstrating robustness against weak boundaries for bottom-up methods. However, the justification is somewhat vague and lacks specific references or examples. It mentions common knowledge about the importance of such comparisons but doesn't cite specific literature. So, it's \"Somewhat Verifiable\" because there's some reasoning but it's not fully robust.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is appreciative but raises questions about the paper's strengths and weaknesses. It provides some suggestions but in a questioning manner rather than giving clear, actionable steps. The helpfulness is moderate because it does point out areas for improvement but lacks the depth and clarity that would make it highly helpful.

It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to define the dashed lines or where exactly they should be placed. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under **Borderline Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is asking about specific figures, which means it's grounded because it refers to specific parts of the paper.

Therefore, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a request without any claim or justification. It's just asking for definitions, which doesn't require evidence or reasoning.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actionability. The review says the paper is a straightforward application of DeCorr, which is about deep graph neural networks, specifically in collaborative filtering. It mentions that the contribution is mainly transposing these insights into a different domain with different datasets and backbones, and even some modifications. The reviewer points out that the paper lacks enough insights into the unique challenges of overcorrelation in recommender systems.\n\nFor Actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The reviewer mentions specific areas like different datasets and backbones but doesn't provide explicit steps on how to improve the paper. It's more of a critique without concrete suggestions. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to change or how to address the lack of insights. It's more of an observation than a directive. So, I think this is borderline actionable because it does hint at areas for improvement but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer talks about the application of DeCorr in a specific domain, mentioning different datasets and backbones. This seems like they are accurately pinpointing the part of the paper being discussed, so the grounding is full. Then, they also point out the lack of insights into overcorrelation challenges, which is a specific issue within the application. So, the specificity is high because they clearly identify what needs improvement.\n\nMoving on to Verifiability. The reviewer's claim is that the paper lacks enough insights into overcorrelation challenges. They back this up by stating that the contribution is mainly the application of existing methods. The reasoning is that DeCorr is well-known, so applying it elsewhere isn't novel. They don't provide external references, but the reasoning is logical. So, it's somewhat verifiable because they have a claim with some justification but lack specific examples or references.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer provides a clear critique of the paper's lack of originality and specific areas for improvement. They suggest modifications but don't go into detail on how to implement them. This is helpful because it guides the authors to recognize their paper's limitations and areas for growth.

It also asks about redundancy and interference in the discretization process. The action here is pointing out an issue with the figure and asking a question. However, the question is quite broad and doesn't specify exactly how to fix the problem or what changes are needed. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but vague on the solution. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it does tell the author to improve the figure but doesn't give clear steps on how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to Figure 2 by name, which is specific. It also mentions the multi-sphere icosahedral discretization process, which is a unique and specific part of the paper. The grounding is strong because it clearly identifies the figure and the process being discussed. The specificity comes from addressing a particular part of the methodology, so this is **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that Figure 2 is ambiguous and suggests looking into redundancy and interference.

However, Matern kernels, which are more commonly used, have spectra that decay polynomially, so the authors' results might be restrictive. \n\nIs this an explicit action? The reviewer is pointing out a limitation but isn't giving a specific action like suggesting a change or providing a reference. It's more of an implicit comment, so it's not explicit. Is it concrete? The reviewer is pointing out that another class of kernels isn't included, but they don't specify how to address this or what changes would be needed.

The comment is suggesting an action, which is to test on more datasets. It's explicit because it tells the authors what to do. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly what to do, which is to try more datasets. So it's not implicit. Therefore, this should be highly actionable because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is asking about more datasets, but it doesn't specify which datasets or where to find them. It's a general suggestion. So the authors can't confidently identify which part of the paper it's addressing beyond the datasets. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't point to a specific section or table. Therefore, it's not grounded at all, so the grounding_specificity score would be not grounded.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a suggestion to test on more datasets. There's no claim here, just a request. So it's a normal statement, not a claim. Therefore, verifiability isn't applicable, and the label would be X.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is asking for more datasets to test the method. It's a suggestion, but it's quite vague. The authors don't know which datasets to use or how to implement this. It's helpful in the sense that it suggests an improvement, but it's not very detailed. So it's somewhat helpful because it does point out an area for improvement, but it's not as helpful as it could be because it lacks specifics.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 5\n- Grounding_specificity: 1\n- Verifiability: X\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It also questions what \u03c3 means, suggesting it's a sigmoid. The comment seems to provide clear instructions on where the issue is and what's missing. It doesn't just point out a problem but also asks for clarification, which is an explicit action. So, it's explicit and concrete. I think this is highly actionable because it tells the authors exactly what's missing and how to check it.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Section 4.2 and specifically points out the equation, which is a clear reference. It also explains what \u03c3 could mean, which adds specificity. So, the grounding is strong because it references a specific part of the paper and explains the issue clearly.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that the equation lacks r^q and that \u03c3 is unclear.

The review mentions a major risk of methods exploiting AU relationships across datasets and suggests a solution by performing cross-dataset experiments. It's explicit about the issue and the solution, so that's explicit. The action is clear: perform cross-dataset experiments. It's also concrete because it tells the authors exactly what to do. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to Figure 1 and specific datasets like SEMAINE and UNBC. It accurately points out the issue in these specific sections, so the grounding is full. It also clearly explains what's wrong in these parts, making it specific. So this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests cross-dataset experiments as a solution. It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion. It's a bit vague because it doesn't explain why cross-dataset experiments are necessary or how they would be conducted. So it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out a significant issue and suggests a clear solution. It's helpful because it guides the authors on what to test, which is a meaningful improvement.

It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. Also, it's concrete because it specifies where to put the information. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions the Starcraft environment but doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly the description should go. It's a bit vague because it's just a general suggestion without pinpointing the section. So, it's not fully grounded, but it's clear which part they're referring to. Maybe it's weakly grounded because they can guess it's about the environment, but not exactly sure of the section. However, since they do mention the environment, I think it's fully grounded because they can identify the part as the environment.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a suggestion without any supporting evidence or reasoning. It's just a recommendation, so there's no claim here. Therefore, it's a normal statement, and verifiability isn't applicable, so it's X.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is clear about what the authors should do and where to put the information. It's specific and actionable, which means the authors can take clear steps to improve their draft.

The reviewer suggests improving processing efficiency by comparing it with existing work. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to see if the review gives explicit and clear instructions. The reviewer does suggest comparing processing efficiency, which is an action, but it's not very specific. They don't tell the authors exactly how to do this comparison or what data to use. So, it's more of an implicit action.

It's pretty specific about the parts of the model. However, it doesn't clearly explain why this approach is an issue or how it affects the paper. So, while it's grounded, it's not very specific about the problem or implications.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer makes a claim that the processing efficiency should be described and compared with existing work.

It mentions that in Atlantis, their method underperforms because of repetitive background sounds. The reviewer is asking for this as an example. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, they're suggesting a specific example. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is pointing out a specific scenario where the method underperforms, but they don't tell the authors exactly how to fix it. They just suggest looking into the weighting method. So it's explicit but not concrete because the authors still need to figure out how to apply the change.

It clearly references these parts of the paper, so the authors can pinpoint where to look. The specificity is good because it tells them exactly what part of the work is lacking. They know to focus on the dataset and benchmarks, which is helpful.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the paper's lack of novelty and incremental nature. It supports this by mentioning the specific datasets used. However, the justification is a bit vague. It doesn't provide concrete examples or references beyond what's already in the paper. So, it's somewhat verifiable because they have some evidence, but it's not robust enough.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out clear issues but doesn't offer detailed suggestions.

So, I think this should be a 3 because it's somewhat verifiable but lacks the necessary references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue with the classification accuracy and suggests improvements. It's clear and actionable, which is helpful for the authors. While it doesn't provide detailed justifications or references, it's still useful.

Let's go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the argument about recognition lists makes sense in principle but points out that in the common case of old vs new judgments, the list is exhaustive and hard to implement. It suggests that concrete predictions can't be tested with simulations. This provides a clear action for the authors to consider the implications of an exhaustive list and its practicality. The comment is explicit and gives a direct action, so it's actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the \"most common case of recognition, old vs new judgments\" and mentions that the list is exhaustive. It clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being discussed, which is the implementation challenges of exhaustive recognition lists. Therefore, the grounding is strong and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that an exhaustive list is hard to implement and that simulations can't test concrete predictions. It supports this claim by explaining the practical challenges and the difficulty in testing, which are logical and common knowledge-based arguments. Thus, it's well-verified.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear feedback on a specific issue, suggesting that the authors consider the practicality of exhaustive lists and the limitations of simulations. This is constructive and directly addresses an important concern, making it highly helpful.\n\nSo, all four aspects are scored as 5 because the review is clear, specific, well-supported, and helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It also points out that without SSL, the method performs worse. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is suggesting that the compared methods should have been initialized similarly, but they don't provide exact steps or how to implement this. So, it's not very concrete. Therefore, this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but vague on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about the experimental setup, specifically the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. They mention the pre-trained model and the comparison with other methods. They also refer to Table 1 and the performance without SSL. This seems pretty grounded because they're referring to specific parts of the paper, like the methods section and the table. They also specify what the issue is, so it's **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the comparison is unfair because of the pre-training setup. They support this by stating that without SSL, the method performs worse. This is logical reasoning and provides specific examples from the paper. So, this is **Fully Verifiable** because the claim is well-supported with clear evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer points out a specific issue and provides some suggestions, but they don't go into detail about how to adjust the compared methods or what data to use for pre-training. While it's helpful, it's not the most detailed. So, this is **Somewhat Helpful** because it addresses the problem but lacks depth in suggestions.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: Somewhat Actionable (3)\n- Grounding Specificity: Fully Grounded and Specific (5)\n- Verifiability: Fully Verifiable (5)\n- Helpfulness: Somewhat Helpful (3)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Fully Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

It's an explicit action because it directly tells the authors where to find more information. But it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly what kind of embeddings or how they should be implemented. So, it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear that they need to refer to another paper, but the details on how to apply it aren't given.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions \"better meta-data embeddings\" without clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. It refers to a specific section (table 1 of another paper), which is a weak ground because it's not the main part of the current paper. The specificity is okay because it mentions what kind of embeddings to use, but it's not tied directly to the current work. So, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does identify a part but doesn't tie it directly to the paper under review.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting that better embeddings would improve performance. It's somewhat justified because it references an existing paper, but it's not very detailed. It doesn't provide specific examples or data from that paper, so it's somewhat verifiable. I think this is a **3: Somewhat Verifiable** score.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a potential improvement but doesn't elaborate on how it would affect the results or provide concrete data. It's clear that the authors should look into another paper, but without specifics, it's not very helpful.

It clearly references a specific part of the paper, so that's full grounding. It also specifies what needs to be compared, which adds specificity. So this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that including such a plot would demonstrate benefits. It provides a logical reasoning for why the plot would be useful, suggesting it's well-supported. There's no mention of external references, but the reasoning is clear.

It mentions that ERM and plug-in have similar performance to Kearns et al., highlighting computation time as the main advantage. The reviewer then recommends publishing the code. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer does suggest publishing the code, which is an action, but it's a bit vague. They don't specify how to implement this or what changes are needed. So, it's more of an implicit action. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear that an action is needed, but the specifics aren't detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to the German and Law school datasets and mentions shorter training times. It also talks about ERM, plug-in methods, and computation time. The reviewer doesn't mention specific sections or tables in the paper, so the grounding is weak. They do imply the datasets but don't pin them down. So, this would be **2: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it's somewhat specific but not entirely clear.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment is making a claim by suggesting that shorter training times are reasonable and that the code should be published. It supports this claim by pointing out similar performance and computation time benefits. However, the justification is a bit vague.

So, this should be fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim about why entropy isn't a good measure.

It also points out that this makes the human baseline weaker. However, it doesn't specify what changes the authors should make or how to improve their draft based on this. It's more of a statement of fact rather than a clear action. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors aren't told exactly what to do next. Maybe they should add more details on how to extend the listening time or what other resources to use. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an issue but doesn't provide explicit steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about the time difference between human and model baselines. It mentions that the human only follows 1 hour versus 15, which is pretty specific. It also references the abstract where the authors made a misleading claim about their results. The grounding here is clear because it directly references the specific time durations and the misleading claim. So, this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to the relevant part of the paper and clearly explains the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that the human baseline follows only 1 hour, which is a claim. It's supported by the abstract's mention of the misleading comparison. The reasoning is logical, pointing out the discrepancy in listening time and its impact on the baseline. There's a reference to external literature (Section 4.1) which adds credibility. So, this is **5: Fully Verifiable** because the claim is well-supported with clear reasoning and references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a significant issue with the human baseline and provides a clear comparison with the model's results. It also suggests that the authors' claim in the abstract is misleading, which is a strong point. However, it doesn't offer specific actionable steps for the authors beyond what was already somewhat mentioned. It's helpful in highlighting the problem but could be more detailed.

It says this leads to a different estimator but isn't fundamentally different. The reviewer suggests the paper should be upfront about its contribution. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a lack of clarity, so it's more of an implicit suggestion. They aren't giving a direct action, just pointing out a problem.

The use of \"is\" suggests a particular proxy, but since there's no proxy named \"Efficient Proxy,\" it's more likely referring to a family of proxies. The comment is explicit about the ambiguity but doesn't provide a clear action or solution. So, it's not giving the authors a specific direction to improve.

The review mentions the model is overly simple, which is an explicit action. But it doesn't specify what needs to be done, like suggesting improvements or explaining why it's simple. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to the model being overly simple, but it doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It's a general statement, so the grounding is weak. It's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the section or issue. So that's a 2.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment suggests the model is overly simple, but it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem (overly simple) and mentions it's both a feature and a bug, which gives some context. However, it doesn't specify how to improve it or provide any actionable suggestions. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully, maybe a 3.\n\nWait, but the helpfulness scale is 1 to 5 with X. Since it's somewhat helpful but not fully, maybe 3 is appropriate. Alternatively, if it's not fully helpful, maybe 2.

So, it's not explicit or concrete. Therefore, it's **Unactionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions a specific task (climate change QA) in a specific language (Arabic). It accurately identifies the part of the paper being addressed, so it's fully grounded. However, it doesn't specify what needs to be done about the narrow focus, so it's not specific in terms of addressing the issue. Thus, it's **Fully Grounded and Under-Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a judgment about the paper's limited broader impact. It's a claim because it's an opinion or judgment. The justification is that the task is narrow and the language-specific, which are general statements without specific references or external citations. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some reasoning but no concrete evidence or examples.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment identifies a potential limitation but doesn't provide specific suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't guide the authors on how to broaden the impact.

It suggests that the paper's settings are too simplified. However, the review doesn't specify exactly what changes the authors should make. It's vague about how to improve the paper, so it's not explicit. Therefore, it's not highly actionable or even somewhat actionable because it lacks concrete steps. It might be borderline actionable since it does suggest an issue but doesn't provide clear guidance.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to previous works and specific sections, so it does ground the comment. It mentions \"Sec 5,\" which is specific. The specificity is good because it clearly states that the findings are not novel and points to a specific section for more details. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review cites previous works and mentions specific sections. However, it doesn't provide detailed reasoning or references beyond the citations. It's somewhat verifiable because it gives some justification but lacks depth. There's no external reference beyond the cited work, so it's not fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out that the paper's findings are not novel and suggests that the settings are too simplified.

That means it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to fix or how to proceed. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions the two distance measures but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to.

So, it's explicit but not very concrete. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detailed guidance.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions a specific paper (Nguyen-Tang et al., AAAI\u201921) which is a strong point. It clearly references a unique element, so the grounding is full. The specificity is also good because it suggests a particular method (moment matching) and provides an example of its application.

It suggests comparing with or without fusion. I think this is explicit because it directly tells the authors where to look. But is it concrete? It says \"compare performance,\" which is clear, but maybe it doesn't specify how to do the comparison, like mentioning statistical tests or exact metrics. So, I'd say it's somewhat actionable because it's explicit but lacks concrete details on the method.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to the \"weight pool\" in the design. That's pretty specific because it's a part of the model. It also mentions \"information redundancy implemented in our design,\" which clearly points to a specific part. So, grounding is fully grounded, and the specificity is high because it explains what's being addressed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that information redundancy is the reason for robustness.

It suggests that this isn't a new approach. Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. The comment mentions that it's not a new approach, which could imply that the method is common, but it doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. It's more of a criticism without a direct action. So, it's not giving a clear next step. Maybe the authors need to think about alternative methods or deeper analysis. Since it's not giving a direct action, it's probably not highly actionable. It might be somewhat actionable if the authors infer that they should consider more sophisticated techniques, but that's a stretch. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: This aspect is about how specific the comment is. The review points out that using a linear model for interpretation isn't novel. It doesn't mention a specific part of the paper or any particular issue, just that it's a known approach.

It also suggests that for some graphs, the existing bound might be better. However, it doesn't provide explicit actions or concrete steps on how to improve the bounds. It seems more like a commentary on the existing work rather than a direct instruction on what to do. So, this isn't very actionable.

It then asks if dropout is applied to the hidden states. The comment is explicit about suggesting an action, which is to check if dropout is applied elsewhere. It's not vague; it's clear what needs to be done. So, this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions Zaremba et al. 2014 as an example, which is specific. It also directly asks about the hidden states, which is a specific part of the model. So, the grounding is both clear and specific. That would be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment makes a claim by suggesting the baseline models aren't properly regularized and asks for evidence. It provides an example from another paper, which is a reference, and logically connects the points. The reasoning is clear and supported by external evidence, so this should be **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a specific issue, providing an example, and asking a direct question. It's clear and actionable, which helps the authors improve their work.

I think this is a 4 because it's explicit but maybe lacks some detail on how to apply it.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions \"two typical games\" and \"more complex problem.\" It's clear which part of the paper it's referring to\u2014specifically, the experiments section. The author can pinpoint where the issue lies, so this is fully grounded. It also clearly specifies what's wrong (lack of performance on complex games). So, this should be a 5 because it's both grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the author didn't test enough complex games. It's a claim because it's an opinion or judgment about the author's work. The justification is that testing more complex games would help, which is a logical reasoning. It doesn't cite external references, but the reasoning is clear. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's supported by logical reasoning but lacks external evidence. I'd score this a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a clear weakness (limited experiments) and suggests an improvement (testing more complex games). It's specific and gives a direction for the author to follow. It's helpful because it guides the author on what to do next, though maybe it could be more detailed. So, I'd rate this a 4 because it's helpful and constructive but could be expanded.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should be:\n- Actionability: 4\n- Grounding_specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 3\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

So, it's both explicit and concrete. I'd rate this as 5 because it's clear and gives actionable info.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about performance over baselines and mentions an error range. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or exact section is affected. It's a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific part.

The reviewer is clearly stating what needs to be done, so that's explicit. Now, are these actions concrete? The reviewer isn't just saying \"add something,\" but they're specifying exactly what to include: MDP elements, trajectories, policy, and DPO algorithm overview. So, the actions are not only explicit but also very concrete. There's no ambiguity about what needs to be done. Therefore, this should be a high score on actionability. I think a 5 here makes sense because the actions are both explicit and detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions including a background section and providing an overview of DPO. They're being specific about the sections of the paper that need to be addressed.

They're stating that without this background, the paper is hard to follow, and that the DPO overview is necessary. While this is a subjective claim, it's based on the reviewer's understanding of the paper's structure. However, there's no external reference or detailed reasoning provided.

I think this is an explicit statement, so it's clear what the issue is. But does it give any specific actions? It suggests the authors should consider more games and baselines, which is a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to expand their experiments.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to Section 7.2 by name, so that's pretty specific. It doesn't just say \"Section 7.2\" but mentions it's about the Atari game results. The specificity is good because it points to a particular part of the paper and explains why it's limited. So, grounding is fully grounded, and the specificity is clear.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the results are limited, which is a claim.

It also asks a question about the convergence of networks in a baseline. The explicitness here is clear because it directly points out the errors and asks a question. The specificity is good because it addresses exact lines. So, this is highly actionable because it tells the author exactly where to fix the typo and the extra period, and it also provides a clear question to address the convergence issue. So, I'd give this a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions specific lines in the document, which means it's fully grounded. It also clearly states what needs to be fixed, so the specificity is high. Therefore, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the review provides specific suggestions and a question. It doesn't just say \"fix this,\" but it also asks why the networks might not have converged. This requires the author to think about their setup, which adds value. So, it's well-supported and verifiable. I'd rate this a 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is very helpful because it points out specific issues and asks insightful questions. It guides the author without being too vague. So, this should be a 5 for helpfulness as well.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It's explicit because it tells the authors to do that. But is it concrete? It says \"compare,\" which is a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly how to implement this comparison, like which datasets to use or specific metrics. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe it's borderline actionable because it's clear the action is to compare, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions comparing with previous top-down and bottom-up methods. It's specific about the type of methods, which helps the authors know exactly where to look. It doesn't just say \"compare with others,\" so this is fully grounded and specific. They know which methods to reference, so grounding is strong here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim by suggesting a comparison. It's supported by common knowledge about pose estimation methods and their typical comparisons. There's no external reference needed, but the reasoning is clear. So, it's fully verifiable because it's backed by standard practices and logical reasoning.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a limitation (no study of inference time) and suggests a comparison. It's clear and provides a meaningful improvement area. It gives the authors a specific task to enhance their work, so it's highly helpful. It's not just pointing out a problem but also offering a solution path, which makes it very valuable.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

The comment suggests these corrections. It's explicit about the mistake and provides clear directions on what needs to be fixed. There's no ambiguity here, so it's explicit. Also, it's concrete because it tells the authors exactly where the issue is and what correction to make. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions Theorem A.3 and points out that x is a vector, not a matrix. It's specific about the part of the paper it's addressing because it references Theorem A.3. It also clearly states what's wrong with the equation. There's no mention of external references or vague statements, so it's fully grounded and specific. That gives it high grounding specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The claim here is that the sum of squares should be 1/d. The reviewer provides a specific correction, which is verifiable because it's based on mathematical reasoning. They're not just stating an opinion; they're pointing out a specific calculation that needs to be checked. So, this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear and directly points out two specific issues. It guides the authors on exactly what to change without being vague.

The review suggests that even with beam search, only 77% of results have ground truth logical forms. It then asks about the percentage of correct entities when there's no ground truth. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives a clear action or suggests something the author can do. The review does suggest checking the percentage of correct entities, which is an action. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to check or what steps to take. It's more of a question than a directive, so it's not very actionable. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't provide detailed guidance.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to section 4.3 and 4.4, which mentions entities and relationships. It talks about replacing them but doesn't clearly specify which parts of the paper are being addressed. The mention is general, so the grounding isn't specific. It's not weakly grounded because it doesn't clearly point to a specific section, but it's not fully grounded either. So, this would be **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by questioning the reliability of replacing entities and relationships. It provides some reasoning by mentioning beam search and 77% accuracy but doesn't cite external references or logical reasoning. The justification is there but lacks depth, so it's somewhat verifiable. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking a question about the percentage of correct entities, which is a specific concern. It provides some reasoning but doesn't offer clear guidance or solutions. It's helpful in that it raises a valid concern but doesn't fully address it.

It suggests these limitations should be discussed. The action here is clear: authors should discuss these limitations. However, the explanation is a bit vague. It doesn't specify how to discuss them or what exactly to add. So, it's explicit in pointing out the limitations but doesn't give concrete steps on how to implement the discussion. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"the claim about evolutional dropout\" and mentions \"internal covariate shift,\" \"low-variance units,\" and \"Batch Normalization.\" It's pretty specific about the parts of the paper it's addressing. It doesn't just say \"this part needs improvement\" but pinpoints exactly where the limitations are. So, this is fully grounded because it accurately identifies the sections being discussed. The specificity is also high because it clearly states what needs to be addressed.

The first point talks about introducing two types of attention in a separate section and then describing the models. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. Then, it mentions moving the layer-wise attention mechanism from two sections to a separate one. Again, that's a specific action. The third point is about referencing tricks like normalization in a separate section, which is also a clear action. So all actions are explicit and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions sections 2.3 and 2.4, which are specific parts of the paper. It also talks about moving mechanisms to a separate section, which is a clear reference. Then, it suggests adding a section for tricks, which is a specific part. So the grounding is explicit and precise, making it fully grounded and specific. That's a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nVerifiability. The review points out issues in the paper and suggests improvements. These are clear claims. The suggestions are well-supported by logical reasoning, like moving sections for clarity. There's no mention of external references, but the suggestions are based on common practices in structuring papers. So it's mostly verifiable, maybe a 4. Alternatively, since the suggestions are logical and common, it could be a 5. I think 5 because the reasoning is solid without needing external citations.\n\nHelpfulness. The review provides clear suggestions on structuring the paper and organizing sections, which directly helps the authors improve their draft. It's specific and actionable, so it's highly helpful.

It's not giving a direct action or suggestion. It's more of an observation rather than an actionable item. So, it's not explicit or direct. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. It might be somewhat actionable if the author feels the need to clarify, but since it's vague, it's probably borderline actionable.\n\n**Grounding Specificity:** The comment refers to Figure 5 but doesn't specify which part of the figure or why the author doesn't understand it. It's a general statement about the figure's labels being wrong. The author might not know exactly where the issue is, so the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or element.

It mentions Bayesian-PAC bounds but doesn't specify how to apply this. So, the comment is explicit about the issue but doesn't give concrete steps on how to fix it. That makes it somewhat actionable because it points out a problem, but it's vague on the solution.

The reviewer does suggest adding a table, which is explicit, but the other suggestions are more vague, like asking why certain assumptions are made and whether the token and rationale limits are reasonable. These are implicit actions because the reviewer is prompting the authors to consider these aspects but isn't giving explicit steps on how to do it. So, it's not fully actionable because some parts are vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about the writing being good and well-organized but doesn't specify which part of the paper needs improvement. They suggest adding a table and ask about assumptions and selection criteria, but without pointing to specific sections or figures.

It also points out that these aren't reported and the plots end at a certain weight decay. The action here is clear: the reviewer is making a prediction about the effects of weight decay. However, the instructions say that explicit actions are needed for high actionability. The reviewer doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next, like adjusting other hyperparameters or trying a different regularization method. So, this is more of an implicit suggestion, which might make it borderline actionable. I think it's a 3 because it's explicit in the prediction but lacks concrete steps on how to apply it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about weight decay applied to all layers and mentions that cosine similarities aren't reported beyond a certain point. The grounding here is pretty explicit because it directly references the layers and the cosine similarities. It doesn't make any educated guesses, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is also high because it clearly states the issue with cosine similarities when weight decay is high. So, this should be a 5 for both grounding and specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that applying too much weight decay leads to worse cosine similarities. They back this up by stating that these aren't reported and the plots end at an optimal point. The reasoning is logical, and they provide some justification, though it's a bit vague about how exactly the cosine similarities are affected. It's somewhat supported but not entirely robust.

Now, the action is to add these experiments, but the review doesn't specify how to do that. It just states the problem. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That would make it **Somewhat Actionable** (score 3).\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific types of experiments but doesn't point to a particular section or figure in the paper. It's a general statement, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper is lacking these experiments. Therefore, it's **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** (score 2).\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the paper lacks these experiments. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's a claim without justification, so it's **Unverifiable** (score 1).\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out a clear need for additional experiments but doesn't provide specific suggestions on what experiments to add or how to implement them. It's vague and lacks depth, so it's **Barely Helpful** (score 2).\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The review is clear about the issue but doesn't give detailed guidance, so actionability is somewhat actionable but not fully. Grounding is weak because it doesn't specify where. Verifiability is low since there's no justification. Helpfulness is low because it's vague.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Unverifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Barely Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests expanding on the vulnerability concern to reassure readers. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue but isn't giving a direct action on what to do. They're asking the authors to expand on their analysis. So, it's an implicit action because the authors have to infer what to do. Is it concrete? Well, the reviewer isn't giving specific steps, just a suggestion to expand. So, it's not very concrete. Therefore, this might be a 3: Somewhat Actionable because it's explicit in pointing out the issue but vague on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about the possible vulnerability in lines 107-110. They mention the feasible set assumption. Is this clearly referencing the paper? Yes, they're pointing to specific lines, so that's full grounding. Then, they specify what needs to be addressed, which is the vulnerability. So, this is both grounded and specific. That would be a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the vulnerability is a real concern. They need to support this with reasoning or references. The reviewer doesn't provide any justification or references, just states the concern. So, it's not verifiable. That would be a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a weakness and suggesting an improvement. It's clear and constructive, but it's not as detailed as a 5. It's helpful because it addresses a potential issue, but it could be more detailed.

It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support why the term is too strong. It's more of an opinion without justification. So, it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out a specific issue with the terminology and provides a clear critique. It suggests that the term is too strong and offers a possible alternative. This is helpful because it guides the authors to reconsider their terminology. It's clear and actionable, so it's **Highly Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: Somewhat Actionable (3)\n- Grounding Specificity: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific (2)\n- Verifiability: Unverifiable (1)\n- Helpfulness: Highly Helpful (5)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Unverifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Highly Helpful\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says the theoretical contribution is weak and unpractical. It mentions that the proof doesn't provide mathematical novelty. I think this is explicit because it directly states the issues. But is it concrete? It points out the weakness and the lack of novelty, so yes, it's explicit and concrete. So I'd rate this as 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to existing results and mentions the proof's lack of mathematical novelty. It doesn't specify which part of the paper is being discussed, but it's clear which area is addressed. So it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the theoretical contribution. The specificity is good because it clearly states the issues. So this would be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the contribution is weak and unpractical. It supports this by mentioning existing results and the proof's lack of novelty. This is logical reasoning and references external knowledge, so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear feedback on the theoretical contribution, highlighting its weakness and lack of novelty.

That's an explicit action, so it's clear. However, it doesn't provide concrete details on how to implement this ablation. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review points out that the comparison on CIFAR isn't convincing because other literature has done extensive experiments and the setup isn't the same as in DEN. It accurately identifies the specific part of the paper being discussed (CIFAR experiments) and explains why the comparison is lacking. So, that's fully grounded and specific. That's a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor Verifiability, the review makes a claim about the comparison not being convincing and suggests a specific improvement. It provides logical reasoning by referencing existing literature and proposes a fairer comparison. This is thorough and supported by external references, so it's fully verifiable.

It's suggesting a change in terminology. Is this explicit? Yes, they're recommending a specific change. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? They're not just saying \"change terminology\", but they're specifying that \"above/below diagonal\" is better. So they're giving a clear direction on what to do. That makes it concrete. So I think this is Highly Actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions \"above/below diagonal\" and \"above/below 45 degree\". It's referring to specific parts of the plot. They're not just talking about the general idea of diagonals but specifically about how they're used in the plot. So they're accurately pinpointing the part being discussed. Also, they're explaining why the alternative is better, which adds specificity. So this should be Fully Grounded and Specific, which is a 5.\n\nVerifiability. The review is making a judgment that \"above/below 45 degree\" is less clear and suggesting an alternative.

I guess you want to write that the sum of the 'optimistic' hoped for rewards is close to the expected actual rewards.\" It seems like it's pointing out that the term \"is sufficient\" is vague. The reviewer is suggesting a more precise explanation. Is this explicit? Yes, they're directly pointing out the lack of clarity. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is giving a specific example of where the term is used and suggesting a more precise explanation. So yes, it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions L240 and L428, which are line numbers. So the author can pinpoint exactly where the issue is. That's full grounding because they're referring to specific sections. Then, the reviewer explains what they're suggesting, which is about the sum of optimistic rewards. That's specific. So this is fully grounded and specific, which is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that \"is sufficient\" is vague. It's a claim because it's suggesting an improvement. Now, is this justified? The reviewer is pointing out a lack of precision, which is a common-sense justification. There's no external reference needed, just logical reasoning. So it's verifiable, but maybe not fully. It's somewhat justified, so maybe a 3? Wait, no, because it's a clear judgment with a logical explanation. So maybe it's 4. But I think since it's a subjective judgment, it's somewhat verifiable. Hmm, maybe 3. Wait, the instructions say if there's a claim, assess how well it's justified. The justification is logical, so maybe it's 4. I'm a bit confused, but I'll go with 4.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a specific issue with line numbers and suggesting a more precise explanation. It's clear and actionable. The authors can go to those lines and understand the suggestion. So this is highly helpful, which is a 5.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, I'm not sure if it's 4 or 3. The claim is that \"is sufficient\" is vague, and the reviewer suggests a more precise explanation. The justification is logical, so maybe it's 4.

It mentions that the model isn't shown to be a prototype approximation of existing models. The reviewer is pointing out a lack of comparison, which is an explicit action. However, the advice given is to compare with prior models, but it doesn't specify how to do that. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer is addressing a specific part of the paper, mentioning Section 2.3 and comparing to prior models. They're pinning down the exact section, which is good. Then, they're pointing out that the model isn't a prototype approximation, which clearly states what's wrong. So this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the model doesn't provide further explanation beyond optimization.

It mentions that O_up should contain offsets for every keypoint within a certain distance r from the center. The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with how groundtruths are built and how the network predicts all keypoints. \n\nIs this an explicit action? The reviewer is explaining a possible problem, so it's more of an implicit suggestion. They're not directly telling the authors what to do, but they're pointing out a potential flaw. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to address it themselves.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions O_up and the distance r. They're referring to specific parts of the network and specific keypoints. This seems pretty grounded because they're clearly pointing to the network's output and a specific condition. They're also explaining what the groundtruths should look like, which helps the authors understand where the issue might be.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the network's current setup might not correctly handle all keypoints within the specified distance. They're suggesting that the network parts responsible for each part need to predict all keypoints. To support this, they're relying on their understanding of how the network works, which is logical reasoning. They're not citing external references, but their explanation is clear and logical, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue in the network's architecture.

For the figures, it suggests making them larger. For equation 5, it asks how it follows from 4. For \u03b8, it wants an explanation of how it comes into play. For S* and S~, it points out the cyclic definition in Assumption 1. These are all clear and direct actions the authors can take. Each part of the review provides an explicit action without being vague. So, this seems highly actionable. I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific issues in the figures, equations, and parameters. It doesn't just say \"there's a problem\" but pinpoints exactly where. It refers to specific equations (5, 4) and parameters (\u03b8^{t+1/2}, S*, S~). This shows that the review is grounded because it clearly identifies the specific parts of the paper being discussed. So, this is fully grounded and specific. I'd score this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains claims. It's making judgments about the figures being unreadable, the derivation of equation 5 from 4, the role of \u03b8^{t+1/2}, and the proper definition of S* and S~. Each of these claims is supported by logical reasoning or common knowledge. For example, the figures being small is a common issue, so it's verifiable. The connection between equations is a logical deduction. The cyclic definition is a known issue in definitions. So, all these are well-supported, making this fully verifiable. I'd give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review provides clear and actionable feedback. It doesn't just state problems but also asks for specific explanations and proper definitions.

It also suggests looking for sample complexity results. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The review does suggest specific areas for improvement and provides some direction, like looking for sample complexity results. However, it's quite vague on how to implement these suggestions.

It's suggesting that the difference isn't significant and is asking for clarification. Is this an explicit action? The reviewer is making a request for clarification, which is an explicit action. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify exactly what part needs clarification. So, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is pointing out a difference between two methods but isn't clearly pinpointing which part of the paper they're referring to. They mention RetinaNet and ATSS but don't specify sections or tables. So, their grounding is weak because they can't exactly identify the referenced part. Maybe a 2 here.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim about the methods not having a significant difference. They're suggesting that RepPoints regresses distance to feature maps, while anchor-based regresses [w, h] to the center. They're asking for clarification. The claim is that the difference is not significant, but the reviewer doesn't provide evidence or justification for this claim. It's more of an opinion without support.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review mentions that the contribution is insufficient and suggests the authors should explore how to leverage complementary for model robustness. It provides a specific example about handling corrupted modalities. This is explicit and gives a clear action, so it's actionable. The action is also concrete because it specifies how to improve robustness. So, this should be a high score.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to the connection between complementary and robustness but doesn't mention specific sections or tables. It's a bit vague, so the grounding is weak. However, it does imply the area being discussed, so it's not completely ungrounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the contribution being insufficient and suggests specific solutions. It provides some reasoning, like the conclusion being intuitive, but lacks specific references or examples. It's somewhat justified, so the verifiability score should be moderate.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is clear and provides specific suggestions, which is helpful. It guides the authors on what to improve without being too vague.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says that focusing on \"best\" clusters is odd. Is this an explicit action? The reviewer is pointing out a problem, but they're not suggesting what to do. They're just pointing out an issue. So, it's more of a clarifying question rather than an explicit instruction. That makes it somewhat actionable because the author can infer they should consider other aspects of representation. But it's vague because it doesn't specify what to do. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"clusters\" but doesn't specify which ones or why. They're talking about the motivation of the paper, which is a bit vague. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint exactly what's being addressed. The specificity is also low because they're not providing clear details about the issue. Therefore, this is **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that focusing on \"best\" is odd. They're not providing any external references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's more of an opinion without justification. So, this is **Unverifiable** because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue in the paper's approach. They're suggesting that the focus is too narrow, which could be helpful for the authors to consider alternative perspectives. However, the comment is quite vague and doesn't offer specific suggestions. It's more of a general critique without concrete advice. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this as **Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: Somewhat Actionable (3)\n- Grounding Specificity: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific (2)\n- Verifiability: Unverifiable (1)\n- Helpfulness: Somewhat Helpful (3)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Unverifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

It's explicit about the action\u2014changing the caption. So that's clear and direct. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells the authors exactly what to do: correct the caption. There's no ambiguity here. So I think this is highly actionable, which would be a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions changing the caption but doesn't specify which figure or part of the paper. It just says \"Figure 7\". Is that enough? Well, the authors can infer that it's Figure 7, but it's not explicitly pointing out which part of the figure needs correction. So it's not fully grounded. It's more of a general comment. Therefore, I'd rate this as somewhat grounded because the authors can figure it out, but it's not as precise as it could be.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review is making a judgment that the caption is incorrect and should be changed. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the caption is incorrect. It's just a suggestion without backing. So this isn't verifiable because there's no supporting reasoning or references. It's more of a claim without any backing, so it's unverifiable, which would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does suggest a specific change, which is helpful. However, it's quite brief and doesn't elaborate on why the change is necessary or how it affects the paper. It lacks depth and could be more helpful if it provided more context or reasoning. So it's somewhat helpful, maybe a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be: actionability 5, grounding_specificity 3, verifiability 1, helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I think it's a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific examples like the paper on AMR parsing and generation. It's clear which part of the paper is being referenced, so the grounding is strong. Also, it specifies what kind of case study to include, which adds specificity. So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides an example of a related work paper. This is a specific external reference, which supports the suggestion. It's clear and logical, so it's fully verifiable. That gives it a 5 here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review offers clear suggestions and references, which are directly useful for the authors. It's not vague and provides concrete steps, so it's highly helpful.

It gives examples like fixed probing capacity and latent size. The reviewer is asking for clarification on why E and S are important. Now, actionability is about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. The comment is asking for clarification, which is a bit vague. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next, just that they should consider E and S. So, it's not giving a clear action, making it borderline actionable. I'd give it a 2.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about DCI and ES but doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's more about the methodology than a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part. The specificity about what needs to be addressed in that part is also lacking. I think this is a 3 because it's weakly grounded but somewhat specific in its request.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that E and S should be considered. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this is important. It's just stating a judgment without backing, so it's borderline verifiable. I'd rate this a 2.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking for clarification, which is helpful in itself because it's prompting the authors to think deeper.

It suggests the author clarify which effects are within the SD range and which are improvements. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, it tells the author what to do. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The review tells the author exactly what to look for (within SD) and what to compare (SoRA vs baseline). So it's concrete. Therefore, this should be 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the experimental section and mentions standard deviation and SoRA. It doesn't specify which figure or table, but it's clear which part of the paper is addressed. Then, it tells the author what to look for, which is specific. So it's fully grounded and specific, giving a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the improvement is limited due to random fluctuations. It supports this by stating that the author should clarify effects within SD. This is logical reasoning and clear, so it's fully verifiable.

It gives examples, which makes it explicit. The suggestions are clear, so authors can take action. It's not vague or implicit. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out specific sections (Figure1, Figure2, Table2) and mentions exact issues like font size and wrong format. It's not just a general critique but targets particular parts, so grounding is full. The specificity is also high because it details exactly what's wrong.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides clear examples and mentions specific issues. It doesn't rely on external references, but the points are logical and based on common knowledge about paper organization. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully because it doesn't cite external sources. Maybe it's a 4 since it's mostly supported but could be better.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is specific and points out clear issues with examples. It guides the authors on what to fix without being too vague. It's helpful but could be improved by adding more context or references.

The comment suggests that this should be clarified or defined. This is an explicit action because the reviewer is directly pointing out the lack of definition. However, the action is vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to define {\\cal P}; it just says \"clarify or define.\" So, it's not concrete. Therefore, the actionability score should be 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review points out that {\\cal P} is undefined, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper or where exactly the definition should be placed. The reviewer is making an educated guess about where to define it, which is weak grounding. Since the grounding is weak, the specificity isn't fully addressed either. So, grounding_specificity would be 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that the notation is undefined, which is a claim. The justification provided is that it's undefined, but there's no external reference or logical reasoning beyond that. It's vague and lacks support, so verifiability is borderline.

I'll give this a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review points include a request to define a variable and clarify a figure's caption. These are more about suggestions rather than claims that need justification. Since there are no claims being made, this aspect doesn't apply, so it's an X.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points are clear and directly address specific issues.

I think this is a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because the action is explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"the rest of the paper\" when talking about the variable 'p'. This isn't very specific because it's a bit vague about where exactly 'p' is used. The authors might not know exactly which section or figure they need to address.

Now, for actionability, it's about whether the review gives a clear instruction on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't suggesting a solution. They're just stating that the method's behavior isn't clear without that assumption. So, this isn't an explicit action; it's more of a statement of a problem.

The review points out a problem but doesn't offer any solutions or guidance on how to address it. It's just pointing out a lack of clarity without suggesting anything the author can do. This means it's not helpful at all because the authors don't get any actionable feedback. So, helpfulness is a 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 2, grounding_specificity: 3, verifiability: 1, helpfulness: 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says that some pieces use existing methods like equation (12) but the presentation is vague. It mentions that it can only be understood after checking the original paper. So, the comment is pointing out an issue but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They know there's a problem but not how to fix it. That seems like it's not fully actionable because it's vague. So, I think this is **Borderline Actionable** because it does hint at an issue but doesn't specify the fix.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions equation (12) but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's unclear whether it's talking about a section, figure, or another element. Since it's not pointing to a specific part, the grounding is weak. Also, it doesn't explain why equation (12) is presented vaguely, so the specificity is lacking. I'd rate this as **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because it doesn't clearly identify the issue and doesn't elaborate on what's wrong.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that the presentation is vague and can only be understood after checking the original paper. There's no claim here, just a statement of a problem. Since there's no justification or evidence provided, it's not verifiable. So, this should be marked as **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a problem but doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve their work. Without clear guidance, it's not helpful at all. So, this would be **1: Not Helpful at All**.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect gets its respective score based on the analysis.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Borderline Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point is asking about the reasons behind two design choices in a model. It's explicit about the two parts (a) and (b), so the author is directly addressing the question. However, it doesn't provide concrete details on how to implement these choices. For example, it doesn't suggest any modifications or specific steps the authors should take. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete guidance. That would make it **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what the issues are but doesn't tell the authors exactly how to fix them.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review point refers to Figure 1 and mentions the same singer's dataset. It's specific about the parts of the model but doesn't tie it back to the actual data or why these modules are necessary. It's clear which part of the paper it's addressing, so that's good. However, it doesn't specify what needs to be addressed in that part beyond the modules. So, it's **Fully Grounded and Specific** because it mentions the section but doesn't go into detail about the issues.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review point is making claims about why the modules are necessary. It's suggesting that having a separate timbre encoder is important for capturing voice characteristics, and that SADTW uses the content encoder's outputs because they're more general. These are logical reasons and references to common knowledge in speech processing. So, it's thoroughly supported, making it **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is asking questions about the design choices, which can help the authors understand their model better. It's not just pointing out weaknesses but also prompting for clarifications, which can be very helpful. However, it's more of a diagnostic question rather than a direct improvement suggestion. It's somewhat helpful because it gets the authors to think about their model's architecture, but it might not provide enough actionable steps. So, I'd rate it **Somewhat Helpful** because it's useful but not the most direct in guiding improvements.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: Somewhat Actionable (3)\n- Grounding Specificity: Fully Grounded and Specific (5)\n- Verifiability: Fully Verifiable (5)\n- Helpfulness: Somewhat Helpful (3)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Fully Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

It should include the results for all four datasets.\" This is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors what needs to be done. It doesn't require them to infer anything. Additionally, it's specific about what should be added. So, it's both explicit and concrete. Therefore, the actionability score should be 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions that Table 4 is incomplete and should include results for all four datasets. It doesn't specify which part of the paper Table 4 refers to or why it's incomplete. The authors might have to make educated guesses, which isn't as grounded as it could be. So, this is weak grounding because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part or provide specific details about the issue.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review point is a claim that Table 4 is incomplete and should include more data. The justification is that it's incomplete, which is a judgment or suggestion. However, there's no supporting evidence or references provided. It's a general statement without any backing, so the verifiability is low. The score here would be 1 because it's unverifiable without more context or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out that Table 4 is incomplete and suggests adding results for all four datasets. This is clear and actionable for the authors. It helps them know exactly what needs to be done without being vague. Therefore, the helpfulness score is 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be more comprehensive if it included more details or examples.\n\nSo, summarizing the scores: Actionability 5, Grounding_specificity 2, Verifiability 1, Helpfulness 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review says, \"As I said above, I found the writing / presentation a bit jumbled at times.\" The action here is pointing out that the writing is jumbled, but it doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's vague because it doesn't suggest any changes or improvements. So, it's not explicit, and since it's vague, it's not actionable. Therefore, this should be a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It's a general statement about the writing being jumbled, so the authors can't pinpoint where the issue is. This means it's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the problematic section. So, grounding_specificity is also a 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is subjective. It's an opinion about the writing being jumbled, which doesn't provide any evidence or justification. There's no reference to external works or logical reasoning to support this claim. Therefore, it's unverifiable, scoring a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is vague and doesn't offer any specific suggestions or improvements. It just states that the writing is jumbled without providing actionable steps. This makes it not helpful at all, so it's a 1 for helpfulness.\n\nOverall, the review point is lacking in all four aspects, so all scores are 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says the stability definition needs better justification. It mentions that the left side can be arbitrarily small under some construction of \\tilde{g} and suggests a more reasonable treatment by adding a lower bound. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a specific issue (left side being arbitrarily small) and suggests a solution (adding a lower bound). The action is clear: modify the definition. It's not just a vague suggestion; they even propose a specific change. So this is explicit and concrete. Therefore, it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the left side of the definition and suggests a modification. It's specific about the part of the paper (the definition) and the issue (left side being too small). They also mention a solution, which is adding a lower bound. This shows that the reviewer can pinpoint exactly where the problem is and what needs to be done. So the grounding is full, and the specificity is high.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the left side can be arbitrarily small and suggests a modification. The justification is that a lower bound would make it more reasonable. This is logical reasoning and common knowledge in mathematical definitions. They're not citing external references, but the reasoning is solid. So it's thoroughly supported, making it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear feedback on a specific issue, suggesting a concrete change. It's not vague; it's specific about the problem and offers a solution.

It's asking for an opinion or clarification. Since it's a question without a direct action or suggestion, it's not providing explicit guidance. It's more of a probing question, so it's not actionable. Therefore, it's probably **1: Unactionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to Section 4, specifically the last paragraph, and mentions variables like $\\alpha$ and IWAE. It's clear which part of the paper it's talking about, so the grounding is strong. It also specifies what the concern is about, which is the annealing scheme's importance when $\\alpha$ isn't decreased to 0. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion about the annealing scheme's importance. It's making a judgment about the potential bias introduced by not decreasing $\\alpha$ to 0. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just an opinion without justification. So, it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is a thoughtful question but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or evidence.

It says the heads are active at S2 but not the primary focus. The comment is explicit about the correction, so that's good. It also provides a clear direction for the authors to check their model against the literature, which is a concrete action. So, this seems highly actionable because it's not just a vague suggestion but a direct instruction on what to do next.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions a specific section of the paper (Section 3) and provides a clear explanation of the issue. It doesn't just say \"this is wrong\" but explains why and where exactly. This makes it fully grounded because the authors can pinpoint where to look and what's wrong. The specificity is also high because it explains the nature of the problem, not just that there's an issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review references an external source (Wang et al., 2023) and explains why the authors' claim is incorrect.

So, I think this is fully grounded because it accurately points to the sections and issues discussed.\n\nVerifiability. The review makes a claim that quantization is a bottleneck, which is a judgment. It supports this by stating the cost and the impact on the method. The reasoning is clear, so it's fully verifiable. Maybe a 5 here.\n\nHelpfulness. The review points out a significant issue with the method's scalability and suggests that the method's purpose is diminished. It's clear and actionable, so it should be highly helpful. Maybe a 5.\n\nWait, but for actionability, since it's explicit but not concrete, maybe it's a 3. Because it tells the authors that quantization is a problem but doesn't suggest how to fix it. So, explicit but vague on the action.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Actionability 3, Grounding Specificity 5, Verifiability 5, Helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It says \"notations issues\" but doesn't specify what needs to be done. So, it's not giving clear actions. That would be borderline actionable because it hints at an action but doesn't detail how to apply it.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review refers to existing methods by citation, which is specific. It mentions \"notations issues\" but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. So, it's not fully grounded because it can't confidently identify the referenced part. It's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment suggests comparing against existing methods but doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just states that the work should aim for an application-oriented venue. There's no supporting reasoning or references, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review offers some guidance by suggesting a comparison but lacks depth and clarity. It doesn't elaborate on why this comparison is necessary or how it would help.

It suggests considering how the algorithm operates when the dataset isn't fully perceptible. Then it talks about the trigger being novel but the validation experiments lacking comprehensiveness, time complexity, and efficiency analysis. It also expects further elucidation on the technical contribution rather than the attack form.\n\nFor Actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The first part is explicit about the problem and suggests considering another aspect, which is good. However, the latter parts about validation experiments, time complexity, and efficiency are more vague. The reviewer is pointing out areas for improvement but doesn't specify exactly how to address them. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully explicit and concrete. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions the training dataset issue, which is specific, but then moves on to trigger novelty and validation experiments. The grounding here is weak because it's not clearly pinpointing the exact part of the paper being discussed beyond the trigger. The mention of time complexity and efficiency is a bit vague. So, this might be weakly grounded and not specific, maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nVerifiability. The review contains claims about the algorithm's requirements, validation experiments, time complexity, etc. For each of these, it's unclear if there's supporting evidence. The reviewer is pointing out issues but doesn't provide references or logical reasoning. So, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nHelpfulness. The review does identify some weaknesses and suggests areas for improvement, which is helpful. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide detailed actionable steps.

The review says that every kernel can be described by a feature space parameterized by a neural network but points out that this isn't true, especially for RBF kernels. It suggests that NNs can't represent infinite-dimensional RKHSs in practice. The comment is explicit about the issue with NNs and provides a clear example with RBF kernels. It also gives a reason why this is a limitation, which helps the authors understand how to apply the fix. So, this is explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding_specificity. The review mentions RBF kernels and infinite-dimensional RKHSs, which are specific parts of the paper. It also refers to the necessity of an NN with infinite width, which is a specific detail. The grounding is strong because it clearly identifies the part of the paper being discussed, and it explains why the limitation is important.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment includes a claim that NNs can't represent infinite-dimensional RKHSs. It supports this with a logical explanation about the width of the network needed. It references well-known properties of RBF kernels and the concept of RKHSs, which are common knowledge. So, it's thoroughly supported, making it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review points out a specific limitation and provides clear, actionable suggestions. It helps the authors understand where their model might fall short and how to adjust it. This is very helpful because it directly addresses a potential issue in their work and guides them on how to improve it.\n\nSo, all four aspects are scored as 5 because the review is explicit, well-grounded, fully verifiable, and highly helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at something but doesn't tell them exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment references specific works, which helps the authors identify where to look. It's not just a vague statement; it points them to existing literature. So, this is fully grounded because it clearly mentions the relevant parts of the literature.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides references to specific works, which are external sources. This means the claim is supported by evidence, making it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is informative and directs the authors to relevant literature, which is helpful. It doesn't ask for more details or suggest additional changes, but it does provide useful information.

It mentions that during training, they can handle long token dimensions but during generation, only limited tokens are used. The reviewer is concerned about the benefits for inference. \n\nIs this an explicit action? The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue, but it's more of a concern than an explicit instruction. They're not suggesting a specific change or action, just pointing out a possible limitation. So, it's not explicit. It's more of a statement than an action. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next based on this comment. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions linear attention and autoregressive decoding. It's clear which part of the paper it's referring to, so the grounding is strong. The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue in the generation phase, so they've identified the exact section. The specificity is also good because they're not just saying something is a problem but specifying what's wrong. So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is pointing out a concern about the inference benefits. They're not making a claim that needs verification; they're expressing a doubt. Since there's no claim, this falls under \"X\" for verifiability. So, the score here is X.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue but isn't providing a solution or suggestion. They're expressing concern without offering actionable steps. This means the authors still need to figure out what to do next on their own. Therefore, it's not very helpful.

It then compares the loss functions by their gradient distributions, noting that MSE has a stricter punishment. The reviewer suggests comparing gradients between KL and PCC. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer does suggest a specific action: comparing gradients. That's explicit. But does it give a clear direction on how to do it? It says \"provide the gradient comparison,\" which is a bit vague. They don't specify how to compute or present the comparison. So, it's explicit but not concrete. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The comment refers to PCC, KL divergence, and MSE loss. It mentions their properties but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper or method it's addressing. It's a bit vague about the specific issue. So, the grounding isn't fully solid. Maybe a 3 or 4. It's better than weak, but not fully pinpointing the section.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that PCC is a relaxed constraint compared to KL. They support this by talking about gradient distributions and citing MSE as stricter. This is logical reasoning and references existing knowledge, so it's verifiable. Maybe a 4 or 5.

It mentions specific measures like behavioral trajectories or time to goal but doesn't provide concrete steps. So, it's not fully actionable. It's more of a suggestion without clear instructions, so I'd rate this as **2: Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to Fig. 4 and mentions behavioral data and pattern separation tasks. It does attempt to ground the discussion by linking GPI to behavioral data, but it's not very specific about which parts of the figure or data it's referring to. It's somewhat vague, so I think this is **3: Somewhat Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting GPI with noise could fit behavioral data better.

It's asking for a comparison, which is an explicit action. However, it doesn't provide concrete details on how to implement this comparison. So, it's explicit but lacks specifics. That would be a **Borderline Actionable** score.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions a specific benchmark, which is the \"small learning rate for attention parameters.\" This is a clear reference, so the grounding is strong. It also specifies what needs to be done, which is a comparison. Therefore, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting a benchmark.

It's asking for experiments to disentangle distribution changes from information removal. The action here is clear: authors should design experiments. But is it explicit? Yes, it tells them what to do. Is it concrete? It suggests specific experiments, so yes. So this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions L29, which was previously careful, and asks about experiments. It's specific about the part of the paper (L29) and what needs to be done. So the grounding is full, and the specificity is high. That's a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the paper should have considered distribution changes. It's suggesting experiments, which requires justification. The justification is logical but maybe not very detailed. It's clear, though, so it's somewhat verifiable.

The comment mentions curiosity about a specific method and metric but doesn't provide any explicit instructions or suggestions on how to improve the paper. It's more of an expression of interest rather than a directive. So, it's not explicit or concrete. Therefore, it's probably borderline actionable because it's implicit but vague.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about the SOTA method (LST) and adaptive metric. It doesn't specify which part of the paper this refers to, like a particular section or figure. It's just a general mention without pinpointing the exact issue.

It mentions putting more focus on the IEM in Fig 3 and improving Figs 7. The suggestions are clear, but are they explicit? The reviewer is telling the authors exactly what to do, so that's explicit. Now, are these actions concrete? The reviewer is giving specific figures to focus on and suggesting improvements, so yes, the actions are concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions specific sections like the introduction, method, experiments, and focuses on Fig 3 and Fig 7. They're not just talking about the paper in general but pointing out exact parts. So the grounding is explicit and clear. They're also specifying what needs improvement in those sections, which adds specificity. Therefore, this is fully grounded and specific, scoring a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the structure and the figures needing improvement. They're not just stating facts; they're suggesting changes. Now, are these claims supported? The reviewer is giving general advice, which is common knowledge in academic writing. They're not citing specific external references, but the suggestions are based on standard practices. So while it's somewhat justified, it's not deeply supported. This might be a 3, but since it's based on common knowledge, maybe it's a 4. Wait, the instructions say to score based on how well the claim is justified. Since they're not citing specific literature, it's somewhat justified but not fully. So maybe 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out areas for improvement and giving specific suggestions. They're not just criticizing but offering clear advice. The suggestions are actionable and specific, so this should be highly helpful. A 5 seems appropriate here.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, the claim is about suggesting improvements, which is a judgment. It's not clear if there's external support. So maybe it's only somewhat verifiable. Hmm, perhaps a 3. But since the advice is general and based on common practices, maybe it's a 4.

However, it's vague on how to implement this, like not specifying which aspects of the related work to focus on. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about adding a discussion of related work but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly to discuss. It's too vague, so the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint where the addition should occur.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point is asking about the comparison between the proposed method and two other references, [9] and [16]. It's a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly what the comparison is about or how the proposed method improves upon these references. The reviewer is also pointing out that the computational cost is only discussed in relation to [9], not [16], which might leave the authors wondering why that particular focus. Since the review doesn't give clear instructions on how to apply these comparisons or what changes are needed, it's not very actionable. So, I'd rate this as **2: Borderline Actionable** because it does suggest something but lacks the explicit steps needed.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review is referring to specific references [9] and [16], which should help the authors pinpoint where to look. However, the questions are quite general. For example, it asks why the authors compared their method with [9] first and then [16], which is a bit broad and doesn't specify the exact issue. Also, the part about computational cost is mentioned without a clear connection to the rest of the paper, which might make it unclear how this relates to their main contribution. So, the grounding is weak because it's not entirely clear which parts of the paper are being discussed, and the specificity in explaining the issues is lacking. I'd give this a **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** score because it does touch on specific references but doesn't clearly explain what's missing.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review contains several claims, such as questioning the comparison with [9] and [16], the focus on computational cost, and the lack of discussion on practical implications. However, these claims aren't well-supported. The reviewer doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back up these points. For example, why is the comparison with [9] first and then [16]? There's no explanation or evidence given. Similarly, the mention of computational cost is made without any justification or references. This makes the verifiability low because the claims lack sufficient support. I think this should be a **1: Unverifiable** score since the reviewer isn't providing enough justification for their points.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review raises valid concerns about the comparison and computational cost but doesn't offer clear solutions or actionable steps. It makes the authors question their work without providing guidance on how to address these issues. The part about computational cost being a big issue isn't explored further, which could be a significant concern for the authors. Since the review doesn't offer much help or direction, it's not very helpful.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests conducting experiments on more datasets and encourages experiments on the full dataset. It's pretty explicit about the actions needed, like adding more datasets and comparing with existing ones. The instructions are clear, so this should be explicit. Also, it provides concrete details on how to implement these changes, like comparing with existing experiments. So, this is highly actionable because the actions are clear and the details are provided. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions \"more datasets\" and \"full dataset.\" It's pretty specific about which parts of the paper need improvement. It doesn't just say \"improve the method\" but points to exact sections. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections. The specificity is also good because it clearly states what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting experiments on more datasets. It's supported by logical reasoning\u2014more datasets provide a more comprehensive evaluation. It's also somewhat common knowledge in the field that more data leads to better results. There's no external reference cited, but the reasoning is solid. So, this is mostly verifiable, maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions and is encouraging, which is helpful. It guides the authors on what to do without being too vague. It's actionable and constructive, so it's highly helpful. I'd give this a 5.\n\nI don't see any borderline cases here. Each aspect is clearly defined and the review point meets the criteria for each.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It also says the dataset transformation and experimental setup were cumbersome and unclear. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out issues but doesn't specify how to fix them. So, it's not explicit or direct. It's more of an implicit comment, which means it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do next. So, this should be a low score. Maybe a 2 because it's borderline actionable but vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: This is about how specific the review is about the paper. The reviewer talks about the tasks and setup but doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper. They mention the tasks and the overall process but don't tie it back to a particular section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded, so maybe a 3 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the tasks didn't prove the claim, and the setup was cumbersome. They need to back this up. But the review doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support this. It's just a statement without justification. So, this is unverifiable. Maybe a 1 here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out problems but not suggesting solutions. They don't offer any actionable steps or improvements. It's more of a critique without providing direction. So, it's not very helpful. Maybe a 2 because it's barely helpful, as it identifies an issue but doesn't help the authors fix it.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding_specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 2\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

So, it's explicit but vague on the action. That would make it borderline actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is referencing another specific paper, so they're clearly pointing out a specific part of the literature. They mention a particular work, which is good for grounding.

It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. So, it's not giving a clear action. I think this is **Borderline Actionable** because it suggests an action (improving the analysis) but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to the correlation between dataset size and Frobenius norm/singular values but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model architectures it's talking about. It's vague on the exact issue. So, this is **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific** because it doesn't clearly pinpoint the referenced part.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review points out that the analysis isn't supported by evidence or theory.

It asks if this is a setback for SSL algorithms aiming for generic representations and whether combining datasets helps. The actions here are clear: questioning the policy's applicability and exploring the impact of dataset combination. The suggestions are explicit, so this is **Explicit**. The details are concrete, pointing to information leakage and the mismatch between pretraining and target datasets. So, it's **Concrete**. Therefore, this should be a **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to specific sections, like L114, and mentions linear classification, object-scene centric datasets, and SSL algorithms. It accurately pinpoints the discussion in the paper, so this is **Fully Grounded**. The specificity is high because it clearly states what's being questioned and why. So, this is a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that AutoAugment's policy trained on ImageNet could cause information leakage and affect SSL.

It suggests providing a mathematical characterization. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The comment here is pointing out a problem (ambiguity in definition) and suggesting a solution (mathematical characterization). It's explicit in pointing out the issue and suggests a fix, so that's good. But does it give clear instructions on how to do that? The suggestion is to provide a mathematical characterization, but it doesn't specify how, like a formula or method. So it's explicit about the action but vague on the details. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to the \"gap between the objective values\" and suggests a mathematical approach. It doesn't explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, like a section or table, so the grounding is weak. It's making a general comment without pinpointing where the issue is. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific.

The comment is pointing out a nuance in the corollary. It's explicit about the point, so that's good. But does it give clear instructions on what to do next? The reviewer is explaining a relationship but isn't suggesting a change. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps.

It's not just a general statement but directly points to a result. Then, it explains the implication without adding new parts.

It also says the model is simplistic because only certain edges are changed. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The comment explicitly states the limitation of the model (only 1 node per time step) and mentions that it's simplistic. However, it doesn't tell the authors what to do next or how to fix it. It's more of a description rather than a clear action. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors aren't guided on how to improve the model. Maybe they could suggest higher reassignment probabilities or more edge changes, but the review doesn't specify that. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does mention the issue but doesn't provide detailed steps on how to address it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about the reassignment probability and the simplicity of the model. It mentions \"1/n\" which is specific, and refers to edges with an average of 1 node changing. This clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed, like a particular parameter or model feature. It also explains what the issue is in detail, so the grounding is strong. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to the section and explains the problem clearly.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment states that the reassignment probability is 1/n and that the model is simplistic. These are claims because they are opinions or judgments about the model's performance and complexity. The justification is provided by stating the probability and the resulting simplicity, which is logical reasoning. There's no external reference, but the explanation is clear and logical. So, this should be **4: Mostly Verifiable** because it supports the claims with logical reasoning, though it doesn't cite external literature.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out specific limitations of the model but doesn't offer constructive suggestions on how to improve it.

It also points out that the optimization strategy, including the grid search for hyperparameters, isn't described. Additionally, the positioning relative to related work is limited, mentioning layer redundancy but not how it compares to existing methods.\n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The review does suggest looking into deeper networks and mentions a specific paper for the optimization strategy, which is helpful.

It provides some meaningful feedback, so it's helpful, though not the most detailed or comprehensive. It's somewhat helpful because it addresses an issue and gives a suggestion, but it's not fully detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are: Actionability 4, Grounding Specificity 1, Verifiability 1, and Helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It also suggests that DeepRL methods are widely adopted and offers a more precise critique. These are explicit actions, so the reviewer is directly telling the authors what to do. Now, are these actions vague or concrete? The reviewer is pointing out specific areas for improvement, like the title and terminology, which are clear. So, this seems to be **Somewhat Actionable** because while the actions are explicit, they might not give detailed steps on how to fix the title or define the term.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"evolutionary methods,\" \"state,\" \"reactiveness,\" and \"learning during an episode.\" They also refer to the title being vague and the term \"brittle convergence properties.\" These are specific parts of the paper, so the reviewer is accurately pinpointing sections. Additionally, they provide examples like DeepRL methods being widely adopted, which helps the authors understand what needs improvement. This seems like **Fully Grounded and Specific** because the reviewer clearly identifies the parts and explains what's wrong.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer suggests making the title more precise and defines \"brittle convergence properties.\" They also reference the adoption of DeepRL methods, which is a valid point. However, they don't provide external references or logical reasoning beyond these general statements. So, this is **Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but not enough to fully support the claims.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer addresses several points, including the title, terminology, and the concept of convergence properties. They also suggest a more precise critique and reference external knowledge. This provides the authors with clear feedback and direction, making it **Highly Helpful** because the suggestions are actionable and cover multiple areas, though they could be expanded for completeness.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Somewhat Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Highly Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

It's pretty explicit, so it's not implicit. It also gives specific actions like pointing out where the paper needs to explain these aspects. It's concrete because it tells the authors exactly what to look for. So I think this is highly actionable, maybe a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions specific parts of the paper: focal stack synthesis, forward model, defocus map, and edges with depth discontinuities. It's not just vague; it's pointing to exact sections. So the grounding is full because it accurately identifies the parts. The specificity is also good because it's clear what's missing. So this should be 5 as well.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting improvements and pointing out areas that need clarification. It's supported by common knowledge about research papers needing detailed explanations and examples. So it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 4 because it's clear but could be more specific with references.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out specific areas and asking for explanations and handling of edges. It's clear and actionable, so it should be highly helpful. Maybe a 5 because it's directly asking for the necessary details the authors need to improve their work.\n\nI think all four aspects are 5 except maybe verifiability, which I'm a bit unsure about.

I think it's a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the algorithm's claimed contribution but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper it's addressing. It talks about the algorithm not needing prior knowledge, which is a general point. There's no specific mention of a section or figure, so the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it's making a general statement without pointing to a specific part of the paper.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment suggests adding empirical justification. This is a claim because it's making a judgment about the necessity of such justification. The support is vague because it doesn't provide examples or references. So, it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a specific weakness (lack of justification) and suggests an improvement.

It also points out that the results are similar to another method. But does this help the authors improve their draft? It seems more like a critique without specific actionable steps. So, it's not very actionable because the authors don't know what exactly to change or how to fix it. Maybe they can look into why the results are similar, but that's not a clear action. So, I'd rate this as 2: Borderline Actionable because it does hint at issues but doesn't specify how to address them.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review references specific models and another study, which is good. It also mentions the results in Table 2. This means the authors can pinpoint where the problems are. So, it's well-grounded because it clearly identifies the sections and references. The specificity is also good because it explains what's wrong. I think this is a 4: Fully Grounded and Specific because it's clear and references specific parts.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review cites previous works and shows results in an appendix. This provides logical reasoning and references, making the claims verifiable. It's thorough enough, so I'd give it a 4: Mostly Verifiable because it's well-supported but maybe a bit lengthy. Wait, no, it's actually quite thorough, so maybe 5: Fully Verifiable. Hmm, but the instructions say to rate based on how well the reasoning is provided. It's clear, so 5 seems right.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out that the components aren't novel and compares results. It gives some context but doesn't suggest specific improvements. While it's helpful in pointing out areas for improvement, it's not as detailed as it could be. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most. I think a 3: Somewhat Helpful is appropriate because it does inform the authors but lacks depth in suggestions.\n\nWait, but the review does suggest looking into why the results are similar, which is a helpful hint.

It also recommends giving a sufficient discussion on the comparison. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The comment explicitly states the issue (similarity to RMED) and suggests a specific action (discuss the comparison). However, it doesn't provide details on how to implement this, like specific points to compare or how to highlight the differences. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That would make it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to RMED by author Komiyama et al. 2015, which is specific. It also mentions the comparison, which is a specific part of the paper. So, the grounding is clear and specific. Therefore, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the novelty is limited and suggests a comparison.

It also suggests adding a flow chart and details about the runtime of solving the OT problem and the selection process. \n\nLooking at the explicitness, the reviewer is making specific questions, so that's explicit. Now, for concreteness, they're not just asking what to do but also why and how, which makes it more concrete. So this should be **4: Mostly Actionable** because while the action is clear, maybe the details could be more specific.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper, which is section 2.4.3, so that's pretty grounded. They're also asking about equation (10) and (3), which are specific parts, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is good because they're clearly stating what needs to be addressed.

It's explicit about the missing experiments and suggests a comparison to ConBO. That's a clear action, so it's explicit. The suggestions are concrete because they ask for specific experiments and a comparison. So, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review points out that the discussion in Section 7 is mentioned, but it doesn't specify which part of the paper that is. It's a bit vague because it refers to Section 7 without pinpointing the exact figure or table. So, the grounding isn't fully there. It's not weakly grounded because it doesn't clearly imply the referenced part. Therefore, it's not fully grounded, so the grounding_specificity would be 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that experiments with continuous tasks are missing and suggests comparing entropy methods to ConBO. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support these claims. It's just stating what needs to be done without backing it up.

The explicit action here is pointing out a potential improvement. However, the suggestion is quite vague. It doesn't specify how to implement the comparison or what exactly should be included. So, it's not giving clear instructions, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.

It's more of a general suggestion. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing exactly where the issue lies. It's making a broad statement, which means the grounding isn't strong.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that GCG's approach could be transferred. It's suggesting a comparison, which is a judgment or opinion.

The reviewer asks for a detailed explanation. Now, is this explicit? The reviewer is asking for more details, which is an action, but is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify exactly what kind of explanation they need. So, it's an explicit action but vague on how to apply it.

It's more of a question than a directive, so it's not very actionable. I'd rate this as **2: Borderline Actionable** because it does hint at a limitation but doesn't give clear guidance on how to proceed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions limitations regarding continuous or infinite spaces. It's clear that the author is referring to the framework's inability to handle these types of POMDPs. The comment is specific about the areas where the framework falls short, so it's well-grounded.

That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions a specific reference to the 'nice' landscape of the objective function for symmetric order-4 tensors. That's a specific part of the paper, so grounding is good. It also clearly states what's being connected, which is the difficulty of symmetric vs. non-symmetric decomposition. That makes it specific.

It's not pointing to a particular section or figure, just asking in general. So, grounding_specificity would be weakly grounded and not specific, which is a score of 2.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a suggestion, which is a claim. But it doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It's just asking the authors to discuss something without supporting why that's important or how to do it. So, it's unverifiable, which is a score of 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is asking a question rather than providing specific feedback. It doesn't tell the authors what to do or why it's important. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve their work. So, it's not helpful at all, scoring a 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 2, grounding_specificity 2, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests that the upper bound is crude and that the nonnegative constraint on the distribution needs to be considered. It also notes that assuming the loss belongs to the RKHS is restrictive. These are all explicit suggestions for the authors. The reviewer is providing clear actions, like pointing out the lack of reformulation and the need for approximation.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says the paper lacks detail on techniques, making it hard to reproduce results. It mentions specific questions like how the sparsification process works, how to generate landmarks on edges, deciding the number of landmarks, types of image features, fixed radius with scales, and achieving shape invariance. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives explicit instructions or if it's vague. The reviewer lists several specific questions, which suggests they are pointing out areas where the paper needs improvement. However, these are more like questions rather than clear instructions on what to do. So, it's not giving explicit actions but rather pointing out issues. That might make it somewhat actionable but not fully. Maybe a 3 or 4?\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific technical aspects like sparsification, landmark generation, and various parameters. It clearly identifies the sections of the paper that need improvement, so the grounding is strong. It's not just a general critique but points to specific parts, which is good. So, grounding specificity should be high, maybe a 4 or 5.\n\n**Verifiability**: The review contains claims about the lack of detail and the need for specific technical details. It's supported by the fact that these are well-known issues in reproducibility, so it's verifiable. The reasoning is clear, pointing out common challenges in research. So, verifiability is probably a 4 or 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is quite detailed, listing several specific areas where the paper falls short. It provides clear suggestions for improvement, which is very helpful for the authors. It's not just a superficial critique but offers concrete points.

Yes, it tells the authors exactly what to do. Is it concrete? It says reorganize, but doesn't specify how. So it's explicit but not very concrete. I think that's a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment mentions Appendix H but doesn't specify which part of that section. It just says it's difficult to follow. So the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the exact issue. It's not fully grounded.

For actionability, it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The first part, adding an introduction, is explicit. The second part, clarifying the figure, is also explicit because it's a direct request. Both are clear actions the authors can take without much guessing. So, this seems highly actionable. I think it's a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions the Related Work section and specifically points out Figure 1. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed because it refers to a specific section and a figure. Then, it asks to clarify details within that figure, which is specific. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the section and figure without needing too much interpretation. I'd give this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting specific improvements. It provides references like [1], [2], and [3], which are well-known works. The reasoning is logical, explaining why adding context-aware robust fine-tuning is beneficial and why preserving features is important. The references are solid, so the claim is thoroughly supported. This should be a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers clear and specific feedback. It tells the authors exactly where to add content and what to clarify in the figure. The suggestions are actionable and directly address potential weaknesses.

It gives an example about recent chunks having temporary high utility leading to premature evictions. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with the approach, which is an explicit action. However, the suggestion to consider other factors like chunk value or recency isn't very detailed. It doesn't specify how to modify the eviction policy, so it's more implicit. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to FIITED and mentions utility-based approach, recent chunks, and eviction decisions. It's clear which part of the paper it's addressing\u2014probably the chunk significance section. The grounding is strong because it directly references a specific part of the paper.

It suggests the paragraph provides little value. Is this explicit? Yes, it mentions DNNs and states it's not central. But is it concrete? It tells the authors to focus on other parts but doesn't specify how. So it's explicit but vague. I think this would be a 3 for Actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions DNNs and states it's not central. It accurately points out the paragraph's lack of relevance. So it's fully grounded because it correctly identifies the section. But is it specific? It mentions DNNs and their relevance, which is specific. So Grounding Specificity would be 5.\n\nVerifiability. The review is a claim that the DNN intro is not central.

It suggests adding quantitative experiments and comparisons between algorithms. The comment is explicit about the need for these actions, so that's clear. It also provides concrete details on what to add, like specific experiments and comparisons. So, this is both explicit and concrete. I think this is highly actionable because it tells the authors exactly what to do without leaving room for interpretation.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out that the framework's performance isn't clear. It doesn't mention a specific part of the paper, but it does suggest looking at the result section and adding quantitative data. However, it's a bit vague about which exact sections or comparisons to make. It doesn't provide a unique element or a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is weak.

The comment is making a claim by stating that the lower bounds follow as a corollary. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's not verifiable. There's no justification given for why this is the case, so it's unclear how the authors can verify or apply this claim.\n\nHelpfulness. The review points out a significant part of the work and suggests a straightforward reduction, which gives the authors some direction. However, it's quite vague on the specifics of how to apply this or what exactly needs to be done. It might be helpful but lacks depth, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable because it mentions the key part of the work, but it's vague on implementation. It's well-grounded in terms of addressing a specific part of the paper but doesn't provide clear verifiable justification. It's somewhat helpful because it points out an important aspect but doesn't give detailed guidance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Unverifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do. So, it's not giving clear actions. It's more of an observation without a direct fix. That makes it **1: Unactionable** because the authors don't know how to improve.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to SDSA, ConsiStory, CLIPseg, and OTSU.

It's an explicit action because it tells the authors exactly what to do. But it doesn't give detailed steps on how to implement this comparison, so it's not fully actionable. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done, but the method is vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions \"images with multiple objects\" and \"cluttered scenes,\" which are specific parts of the paper.

It doesn't refer to any specific part of the paper beyond the implementation choice, but it's clear which part is being addressed\u2014the kernels. The grounding is solid because it's pointing out the specific technology used. The specificity is also good because it explains why a full-page isn't needed, which adds context. So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a claim that using CUDA isn't necessary because of known engineering improvements. The support given is that it's well-known, which is a common knowledge point. It's logical and provides a justification without needing external references. So, this is somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 4? Wait, the support is there, but it's a bit vague. Maybe it's borderline.

It doesn't give clear instructions on how to improve the model. So, it's not explicit or concrete. It's more of an implicit comment, which makes it borderline actionable because it suggests a problem but doesn't tell the authors how to fix it. So, I think it's a 2 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions yes/no responses but doesn't specify which part of the paper or the model it's addressing. It's too vague. The authors don't know where the issue lies, so grounding is weak. It's not grounded because it doesn't clearly point to the specific section or issue. So, grounding_specificity would be a 2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that yes/no responses aren't sufficient. It needs justification, like explaining why they're incorrect. But the review doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back this up. It's just a statement without support, so it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out a limitation but doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't help the authors much.

The action here is clear: improve the discussion. But does it give specific steps? It says \"more datasets\" and \"correct forecast horizon,\" which are specific actions. So, it's explicit and concrete. That should be a high score.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"the very-long-term forecasting task\" and mentions \"more datasets\" and \"correct forecast horizon.\" It's specific about the areas needing improvement. It doesn't just say \"improve the discussion\" but pinpoints the exact aspects. So, the grounding is strong because it clearly identifies the sections or elements to focus on.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the task is limited in significance and suggests improvements. It provides some reasoning by mentioning experiments on more datasets and correct forecast horizon. However, it's a bit vague about how these experiments will be conducted or what the expected results are. There's some justification but not detailed enough.

It mentions that they should have experiments for spatial, temporal, and summary queries. The reviewer is pointing out a lack of these experiments and explanations. Now, is this actionable? Well, the reviewer is suggesting specific experiments and explanations, so the action is explicit. But does it give a clear instruction on what to do? It says \"there should be experiments and explanation,\" which is a clear instruction. However, it doesn't specify how to implement these experiments or what data to collect. So, it's explicit but not very concrete. That would make it borderline actionable, which is a 2.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions specific components like spatial, temporal, and summary queries. They are pointing out a lack in these areas. So, the grounding is explicit because they're referring to specific parts of the paper. They're not making general comments but are directly addressing certain sections. Therefore, this is fully grounded.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is making a claim that the experiments are missing. They're suggesting that the paper should include these experiments.

So, it's not fully actionable but gives a clear direction. I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to specific models like SIG-VAE and VGAE, which are clearly mentioned. It also talks about optimizing only the inference part, which is a specific part of the model. The grounding is strong because it accurately points to these sections. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests trying these specific models and comparing inference methods. It's making a claim by suggesting these changes, and it's supported by logical reasoning about the models. There's no external reference, but the reasoning is clear. So, this is **Somewhat Verifiable** because it has some justification but could benefit from more references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a method to evaluate the model's benefits, which is helpful for the authors. It's specific about what to do and why, so it's quite helpful. It doesn't seem too vague or lacking in guidance, so I'd rate this as **Highly Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Somewhat Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Highly Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests a new network design inspired by prior work. The comment is explicit about the contribution, so that's good. However, it doesn't specify how to improve the network or what changes are needed. It's vague on the actionable steps, so it's not fully actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the method's inspiration from prior work but doesn't clearly specify which part of the paper or section is being discussed. It mentions \"prior work\" but doesn't point to a specific section or figure, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't provide enough detail about what needs to be addressed, so it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment states that the contribution is somewhat incremental and suggests a new network design inspired by prior work. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. There's no logical reasoning or external citations, so it's not verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out the novelty but doesn't offer specific suggestions or improvements.

It suggests that without it, predictions might depend on image size. This is a clear action, so it's explicit. The action is also concrete because it tells the authors exactly what to consider. So, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out a specific part of the paper, table 3, and mentions visualizations. It also refers to the 2D image space and graph structure. This is pretty specific, so grounding is strong. The specificity is high because it clearly directs the authors to a particular section and the issue with locality. So, grounding_specificity should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides some reasoning about the potential dependence on image size if locality isn't encoded. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't cite external references or provide a strong justification. It's somewhat verifiable but not fully. So, I'd rate this a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific area for discussion and suggests a potential issue.

It also talks about the impact on the constant factor of the required feature size and references Figure 1. However, it doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They might need to adjust their methods or re-examine their assumptions. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still have to infer the necessary steps.

It provides references, which makes the action clear. However, it doesn't specify which part of the model to modify. So, the action is explicit, but the implementation details are vague. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because it tells the authors what to look for but not exactly how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review references a specific paper, which is good.

It doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why GRU and LSTM were chosen. There's no reference to external studies, common practices, or logical reasoning supporting this choice. So, it's not verifiable because there's nothing to back up the suggestion, making it hard for the authors to assess the validity of the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: Since the review point doesn't offer specific actionable steps, clear justifications, or evidence, it's not helpful. The authors won't get clear guidance on how to improve their model based on this comment. It's more of a general question without the depth needed for meaningful feedback.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the review point scores as follows: actionability 1, grounding_specificity 1, verifiability 1, and helpfulness 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}

Since it's an implicit action, the reviewer is prompting the author to clarify, but it's not giving a direct action. So, it's not explicit. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because the action is implicit but not vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper, line 135, which mentions \"active vertices.\" The comment is clear about which part it's referring to, so the grounding is strong. Additionally, the comment is specific because it directly addresses what's unclear in that part. So, this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting that \"active vertices\" needs clarification. The reviewer is making a judgment that the term isn't well-defined, which requires justification. However, the justification is minimal because it's just pointing out the lack of definition without citing external references or providing examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific area for clarification, which is helpful. It's not vague and directly addresses a potential issue the author might have.

The review mentions that the authors didn't honestly mention the limitation of their theory not being applicable to the model. It suggests they should have discussed this but instead only have vague assumptions in the appendix. It also points out that the authors underestimate the use of GNNs in industry and suggests elaborating on their negative societal impacts. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what the authors should do. The first part suggests they should address the limitation by mentioning it in limitations, which is explicit. However, the second part about GNNs is more vague\u2014saying they're widely used but not elaborating on the specifics. So, the explicit part is there, but the second part isn't clear on how to elaborate. So, it's partially actionable. I think this would be a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review talks about the limitations and the societal impact. It mentions the appendix for assumptions, which is specific, and also talks about GNNs being widely used, which is a general point. So, it's not fully pinpointing a specific part of the paper, but it's clear where the issues are. I think this is weak grounding because it's not exactly pointing to a specific section or figure, but it's still identifying areas. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the authors underestimate the use of GNNs and that they should elaborate on negative impacts. It also mentions the limitations not being discussed. The support for the first part is vague\u2014it just says they're widely used without references. The second part about negative impacts could use more justification, like citing studies or examples. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. Maybe a 3 here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out two main issues: the missing limitation discussion and the lack of elaboration on GNNs' societal impact. It suggests improvements but doesn't go into detail.

You have epsilon-greedy exploration on top of the proposed strategy?\" \n\nFirst, I check if it's an explicit or implicit action. The reviewer is asking a question, which is a common way to prompt clarification. Since it's a question, it's implicit because the author has to figure out what the reviewer is asking. So, it's not explicit. \n\nNext, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking about the use of epsilon-greedy exploration, but they don't specify how it's implemented or what impact it has. It's vague because it doesn't provide actionable steps or details. So, it's borderline actionable. \n\nMoving to **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper, right before Appendix D.2. That's pretty specific. They're not making an educated guess; they're directly referencing a section. So, the grounding is full. But what about specificity? The reviewer is asking about the use of epsilon-greedy, which is a specific method. So, the specificity is also high. \n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that epsilon-greedy was used on top of the strategy. They're asking for clarification, which is a claim. To verify this, the authors would need to check the code or methods section for evidence of epsilon-greedy implementation. So, it's somewhat verifiable because there's a logical step the authors can take, but it's not fully supported with references or examples. \n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking a clear question about a specific part of the paper.

The first part is explicit\u2014changing a figure reference. But the second part, about attaching proofs, is vague. It doesn't specify how or where, so it's not actionable. So, it's partially actionable but lacks clarity, making it borderline.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to \"each theorem and corollary\" and their proofs. It mentions the main paper, which is specific. However, it doesn't provide details on how this affects the paper's sections or what part needs improvement. So, it's grounded but not specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review includes a judgment about the paper's strengths but lacks supporting evidence. It states the paper has good novelty and results but doesn't cite any external sources or explain why. So, it's borderline verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers some positive opinion and a minor suggestion about figures.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review mentions that determiner missing Section 3 and asks about action verbs, specifically the 50 classes. It also questions whether the chosen verbs are all action verbs as per Levin. The reviewer is pointing out that the section might be missing some key points. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. \n\nIn this case, the reviewer is asking about the selection of action verbs, which is a suggestion, but it's not giving a direct action. It's more of a question or a request for clarification rather than a directive. So, it's not explicit. It's also vague because it's not providing a specific action or how to implement it. Therefore, it's not highly actionable. It might be somewhat actionable if we consider the suggestion, but since it's vague, I think it's borderline actionable. So, I'd give it a 2.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The reviewer is talking about Section 3, which I assume is a specific part of the paper. They're asking about action verbs, which are part of the methodology or writing style. The mention of Section 3 is specific, so the grounding is strong. However, the content they're asking about is more about methodology rather than the paper's content. So, while they're specific about the section, the issue is about methodology, which might not be as grounded. But since they did mention Section 3, I think it's weakly grounded. The specificity about the verbs is clear, so it's somewhat specific. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is asking about whether the chosen verbs are action verbs as per Levin. This is a claim because they're making a judgment about the appropriateness of the verbs. Now, is this claim well-supported? The reviewer is referencing Levin's work, which is a well-known source, so the justification is there. They're also asking a question, which is a form of justification. So, the claim is somewhat verifiable because they're citing a reference but it's not fully detailed. Maybe it's somewhat verifiable, so a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a methodological issue in Section 3 and asking about the choice of action verbs. This seems to be more about the methodology rather than the substance of the paper. It might not directly help the authors improve their main arguments or results. So, while it's helpful in pointing out a methodological gap, it's not as helpful as a comment that addresses the content. Therefore, it's somewhat helpful, so a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It's an explicit action because it directly points out the mistake. However, it doesn't provide any specific instructions on how to fix it, like suggesting the correct term or where to change it. So, it's explicit but lacks detail. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it's clear but not very specific on how to apply the correction.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review points out a specific line and page, so it's fully grounded. It mentions line 32 of page 1, which is specific enough for the authors to locate the issue. There's no mention of external work or examples, but since it's about a typo, it's clear what needs to be fixed. So, this should be \"Fully Grounded and Specific\".\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that \"Empiically\" is incorrect. The justification is that it's a typo and should be \"Empirically\". This is supported by common knowledge about correct spelling and common-sense reasoning. It's clear and logical, so it's \"Fully Verifiable\".\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a clear typo and suggests a correction. It's helpful because it identifies the issue and provides a straightforward fix. It doesn't seem too vague or minimal, so it's \"Somewhat Helpful\" because while it's helpful, it could be more detailed, but it's still useful for the authors.\n\nWait, but the helpfulness score might be a bit higher since it's a clear typo. Maybe it's \"Mostly Helpful\" because it's helpful but could be expanded. Hmm, but the main issue is just a typo, so it's somewhat helpful but not the most. I'll stick with \"Somewhat Helpful\" for now.\n\nWait, no, actually, the helpfulness is quite clear and directly useful, so maybe it's \"Mostly Helpful\". Let me reconsider. The comment is specific, identifies an error, and provides a clear correction. It's helpful but perhaps not the most comprehensive. So, \"Mostly Helpful\" seems appropriate.\n\nWait, but the initial thought was \"Somewhat Helpful\", but upon reconsideration, it's more than that. The correction is direct and useful, so \"Mostly Helpful\" is better.\n\nWait, no, the initial thought was \"Somewhat Helpful\", but upon further evaluation, it's clear and directly useful, so maybe \"Mostly Helpful\" is more accurate.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check the definitions again. \"Somewhat Helpful\" is for incomplete or lacking depth, while \"Mostly Helpful\" is for clear and actionable feedback. Since the comment is clear and provides a direct correction, it's \"Mostly Helpful\".\n\nWait, no, the initial thought was \"Somewhat Helpful\", but upon reconsideration, it's more than that. The correction is direct and useful, so \"Mostly Helpful\" is better.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating. The review is pointing out a typo, which is a clear issue. It's helpful but perhaps not the most detailed. So, \"Mostly Helpful\" is appropriate.\n\nWait, no, the initial thought was \"Somewhat Helpful\", but upon reconsideration, it's more than that. The correction is direct and useful, so \"Mostly Helpful\" is better.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The review is pointing out a specific typo, which is clear and actionable.

The reviewer suggests that the feature selection in Section 4.2 could be improved with consideration of representation learning. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is suggesting improvements but doesn't specify exactly what needs to be done. They mention considering representation learning but don't provide clear steps or examples.

Since it doesn't pinpoint where the issue is, the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't identify the specific part of the paper being addressed. So, this would be **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it states that the writing could be improved. However, there's no supporting evidence or justification provided. The reviewer just mentions their own effort without backing it up with references or logical reasoning. This makes the claim unverifiable. So, the verifiability score is **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is somewhat helpful because it does suggest that the writing needs improvement. However, it's vague and doesn't provide specific directions on how to improve it. The reviewer talks about the effort they went through but doesn't offer actionable steps or examples. So, it's helpful but not very detailed. This would be **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding_specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It's a yes/no question, but it doesn't provide any specific instructions or actions on how to do that. So, the authors don't know what exactly needs to be changed or fixed. That makes it unactionable because there's no clear guidance. So, I'd rate this as 1 for Actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment is asking about concatenating text inputs with object elements, but it's very vague. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or which section it's referring to. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is because the comment is too general. So, this is not grounded at all. I'll give it a 1 here.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is a question, which doesn't really count as a claim. It's more of a factual statement asking for information rather than making a judgment or suggestion. Since there's no claim, it doesn't need to be verifiable.

It also points out that the baselines haven't explored this trade-off. The comment is explicit about the issues but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. It's more of a critique without concrete steps, so it's not actionable. I think this is borderline because it does point out problems but doesn't give clear fixes.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific works like Decouple and mentions hyper-parameters, which grounds it in existing literature. It also talks about trade-offs, which are specific to the analysis. So, this seems well-grounded because it references specific parts of the paper and external work.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the proposed approach is worse or not as good as Decouple. It supports this with references to Table 5 and the trade-off analysis. The references are specific and logical, so this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about the shortcomings and suggests improvements, which is helpful.

The comment doesn't specify how to perform this comparison, like whether it's a direct comparison or what metrics to use. So it's explicit but vague. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions a specific paper, Revisiting Visual Question Answering Baselines. That's a clear mention of a section or unique aspect, so grounding is strong. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, which is comparing with existing models. So grounding_specificity would be a 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting a comparison. It's supported by external references, which is a strong justification. So verifiability should be a 5 because it's thoroughly supported.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides a clear suggestion to compare with another model, which is helpful. It's specific and actionable, so it's highly helpful. Therefore, helpfulness is a 5.\n\nI think that's all.

So, this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that ResNet doesn't share parameters and suggests a baseline. It provides a logical reasoning by comparing it to an ODE net, which is a well-known concept. It references common knowledge about ODEs and Euler integrators, so this is fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific improvement and even suggests a baseline. It's clear and directly addresses a potential area for the authors to explore. This should be highly helpful, so a 5.\n\nI don't see any issues with these scores. Each aspect is well-covered and the review point is quite informative and actionable.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

So, it's not explicit, and the action isn't clear. I think this is **Borderline Actionable** because it hints at an action but doesn't specify how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions cross-encoder architecture but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing.

It also points out that the baseline methods are outdated. This is explicit, so it's actionable. However, it doesn't specify how to improve or what changes to make, so it's not very concrete. I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"an antiquated GNN model\" and \"baseline algorithms/methods.\" It doesn't mention specific sections, tables, or figures, so the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it's making general comments without pointing to exact parts of the paper.

It doesn't specify which part of the figure or what exactly is unclear. It's making an educated guess about where the issue is without pinpointing it.

The review mentions that the experiment uses pseudo feature importance because there's no true feature importance available. It also points out that the correctness of this pseudo importance depends on Proposition 3.2 and choosing a large enough perturbation value. The reviewer suggests that it's hard to trust the experiment because the difference between the tested method and the pseudo feature importance is just the number of perturbations. They also suggest two ways to strengthen the experiment.\n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The review does explicitly state the issues (no true feature importance, dependence on Prop 3.2, perturbation value) and provides two concrete suggestions. So it's explicit and concrete, which should be a high score.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like Prop 3.2 and perturbation value, and clearly states what's wrong with the experiment. It doesn't just refer to general issues but points to specific elements, so this is fully grounded and specific. That should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the experiment is not trustworthy because the difference is just the number of perturbations. It supports this with references to Prop 3.2 and the need for a large perturbation. This is logical reasoning and references external knowledge (the proposition), so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review provides clear feedback on the experiment's limitations and offers specific suggestions to improve it. It's actionable and constructive, which means it's highly helpful.

It tells the author what to do, which is actionable. But does it give specific steps? It just mentions that Z should have good properties, which is a bit vague. So I think it's 3: Somewhat Actionable because it's clear but lacks detail on how to apply it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity.

They mention the exact part of the equation, which is a clear reference. The comment is specific about the equation, so it's fully grounded. Since the comment is about a specific part of the paper, it's well-grounded. There's no mention of external work or examples, but the specificity is clear.

The review points out specific sections and changes, like L502 and L507, which are pretty specific. It doesn't just say \"the references should be in SuppMat\" but gives exact line numbers and what to change. So the grounding is solid because it clearly references the paper's parts. I'd give this a 4.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making claims about the formatting issues and suggesting changes. It's not just stating facts; it's giving advice.

So, it should be **4: Mostly Helpful**.\n\nI think that covers all aspects. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

It's pointing out that the improvement isn't enough. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is making a judgment about the claim's validity, so it's explicit. But does it give a clear direction on what to do? It suggests that the improvement isn't enough, but it doesn't tell the authors what exactly to change or how to proceed. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment mentions specific tables but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's referring to \"various language pairs and domains\" without pinning down the exact section or figure. So the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. The specificity about what's wrong is there, but the part it's addressing isn't clearly identified. So this would be a 3 for grounding specificity.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim that the slight improvement supports the effectiveness claim. It's a subjective opinion, so it's a claim. Now, is this claim supported? The reviewer is stating that the improvement isn't enough, but there's no justification or references provided. It's just a judgment without backing. So the verifiability is low. It's borderline because it's a claim but lacks support. So maybe a 2 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The comment is pointing out that the slight improvement isn't enough, which is helpful because it directs the authors to reconsider their approach. However, it's vague and doesn't provide specific suggestions or details on how to improve. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully. That would be a 3 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding 3, verifiability 2, and helpfulness 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

So the action is clear: compare against these models. Now, is it explicit or implicit? Since it directly mentions the models, it's explicit. Next, is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how to implement the comparison, like suggesting a particular method or providing results. So it's not very concrete. Therefore, this review is somewhat actionable because it tells the authors what to do, but not exactly how. So on a scale of 1 to 5, I'd give it a 3 for actionability.\n\nMoving on to grounding_specificity. The review mentions two specific models, so the grounding is clear. It accurately points out which parts of the paper are being addressed\u2014their performance on multilingual tasks. The specificity is good because it's not just a general statement but refers to specific models. So this should be fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the review claims that comparing with these models is recommended. Now, is this claim supported by evidence? The reviewer doesn't provide any justification or references. They just suggest comparing with these models. So there's no supporting evidence, making it unverifiable. Therefore, verifiability would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review suggests comparing with two models, which is helpful because it provides a direction for improvement. However, it doesn't explain why this comparison is necessary or how it helps the paper. It's vague in the reasoning part. So while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully detailed.

It suggests that there could be many different designs, like experiments with different sampling intervals and sample sizes. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The review mentions possible designs but doesn't specify what exactly the authors should do. It's suggesting improvements but not detailing how to implement them. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what experiments to run. Maybe they could add more specific actions, like recommending specific sampling intervals or sample sizes, but as it stands, it's a bit vague. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't give clear details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about Cycle FC aligning features at different spatial locations to the same channel. It mentions that the analysis is insufficient and suggests considering different designs. \n\nGrounding refers to how specific the comment is about the paper. Here, the comment mentions a specific part of the method, Cycle FC, and what it does. It doesn't explicitly name sections or tables but refers to a part of the methodology. Specificity is about what exactly is wrong. The comment points out that the analysis is insufficient but doesn't specify what's wrong with it. It's a bit vague on the issues. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing exactly where the problem is. Therefore, I'd give this a **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does imply a part but doesn't clearly specify the issue.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment contains a claim that the analysis is insufficient and suggests considering different designs. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just stating an opinion without backing it up. So, this is an **1: Unverifiable** because there's no justification or evidence provided to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential improvement area but doesn't specify how or what experiments to conduct. It's vague and doesn't offer concrete suggestions.

The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue with the Vandermonde matrix, which is a clear action.

So, it's explicit about the problem but not on how to fix it. That would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer refers to Algorithm 1 by name and mentions its properties, so that's explicit grounding. They also suggest providing experimental results, which is a specific request about the algorithm. So, this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the Vandermonde matrix is ill-conditioned and that the algorithm might fail.

Is this explicit or implicit? Well, it's directly asking for the feature extractor, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking for the name or type of the feature extractor, which is specific enough. So, this should be highly actionable because the author knows exactly what information to provide.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is pointing out a specific part of the paper, line 201, so the grounding is clear. It's not making a general comment but specifically referencing a line. Therefore, the grounding is strong. Also, it's asking for a specific detail, so the specificity is high. This means the comment is well-grounded and specific, so it scores highly on grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting that the dimensionality is 512 and asking about the feature extractor.

It suggests adding measurements like GPU hours or training time. The comment is explicit about the action (adding specific metrics) and provides clear details on how to implement it. So, this is highly actionable because it tells the authors exactly what to do and how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out that the paper doesn't provide specific measurements. It doesn't mention which parts of the paper are being referred to, like sections or figures. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or element. It's more of a general suggestion without pinpointing where the issue lies.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that the paper lacks quantitative data and suggests adding specific measurements. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up why adding these metrics is necessary.

The review points out that the authors didn't discuss the 'filter manifold network' (FMN) much and asks if they tried other architectures. It also questions if FMN scales with more filter parameters. The suggestions are explicit: ask about other architectures and scaling issues. However, the guidance is a bit vague. The authors need to explore more architectures, but the review doesn't specify how to do that, like suggesting which ones or what experiments to run. Also, the scalability part is raised but not detailed on how to test it. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable** because the action is clear but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions FMN and asks about other architectures, which is specific. It also questions scalability, which relates to the paper's content. The grounding is strong because it directly refers to the FMN and the experiments they conducted. So, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains claims about the lack of discussion on FMN and the scalability issues. These claims are supported by logical reasoning\u2014FMN's scalability isn't standard, and experiments with small channels might limit its applicability.

It suggests comparisons to UNets and mentions specific papers. This is explicit because it directly states the components involved and suggests a comparison. It's also concrete because it provides specific details about the operations and references other works. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific components like the fractional transform and UNet, and references particular papers. It accurately points to the parts of the model being discussed, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is high because it clearly explains what needs to be addressed and why.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the performance boost comes from either the fractional transform or the UNet operation. It supports this with references to other works, which are external sources. This provides sufficient justification, so it's somewhat verifiable but could be more robust. However, since it's supported by references, it's definitely verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out potential issues with the model's architecture and suggests improvements by comparing it to established models.

It also notes that the paper is motivated by supervised contrastive learning (DSCL), improving the discriminative of tail classes. However, the reviewer doesn't explicitly state what needs to be done to improve PBSD or DSCL. It seems like the reviewer is pointing out issues but not providing clear actions or solutions. So, this is more of an implicit suggestion rather than explicit. Therefore, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly how to fix it.

I think this is a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific because it accurately points to the method and explains its importance.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the method might be different from traditional active learning. It doesn't provide evidence or references to back this up. Without justification, it's hard for the authors to verify if their method is indeed different. So this is 1: Unverifiable because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review raises a valid concern about potential misinterpretation. It provides some guidance by pointing out the need for clarification but doesn't offer specific steps or solutions. It's helpful in identifying the issue but doesn't fully assist in resolving it. So this is a 3: Somewhat Helpful because it does inform the authors of a problem but doesn't offer a complete fix.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests the authors should compare tensor completion results for all models with the same number of parameters. \n\nFirst, is this an explicit action? Yes, the reviewer is pointing out a specific issue (omitted ranks) and suggesting a solution. So it's explicit. Now, is the action concrete? The reviewer is telling the authors exactly what to do: compare results with the same number of parameters. That's very specific. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions comparing all models with the same number of parameters. They even suggest adding the number of entries in core tensors. This clearly references specific parts of the paper, like the experiment settings. So the grounding is full because they're pointing to exact sections and methods. The specificity is also high because they're not just saying \"compare all models,\" but specifically how to do it by looking at parameters.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is making a claim that the comparison is unclear because ranks are omitted. They provide a suggestion to fix this by comparing models with the same parameters. The justification is clear: without knowing the parameters, the comparison isn't fair. They also reference the method of adding core tensor entries to compute parameters.

It points out that figures are good for intuition but need standardization. It also talks about a specific figure (Fig. 4) and some minor text issues. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does suggest standardizing pictograms, which is explicit. However, they don't specify how to do it, like which symbols to use or where the overlaps are. So it's not fully actionable because the method isn't detailed. It's more of an implicit suggestion.

This is an explicit action because the reviewer is directly pointing out a missing part in the methodology. It's not a suggestion to add something but rather a critique of what's missing. So, it's actionable because the authors can look into their algorithm for more details. It's also specific about the computational cost, which adds clarity.

They clearly identify the specific part of the paper being addressed, which is the methodology section. They also specify what the issue is, comparing it to baselines. So, this has strong grounding because it's specific and clear about the part of the paper being discussed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the same procedure is used as for baselines, which is a judgment. They provide some reasoning by pointing out that most baselines don't use 300W-LP. However, they don't cite external references or provide detailed examples, so the justification is somewhat vague. This makes it somewhat verifiable but not fully robust.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer raises a valid concern but doesn't offer detailed suggestions on how to improve the methodology. They mention the potential unfair advantage but don't propose solutions.

Since it's explicit and asks for a specific reason, I'll give it a 4.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is pointing out a specific section, section 4, so that's good grounding. They're not just talking about the paper as a whole but a particular part. Then, they're asking about the purpose beyond T/I/O, which is specific. So, they're clearly identifying the issue in that section and what's needed. That should be a 5 because it's both grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is asking for an explanation of why separators were introduced. This is a claim that needs to be supported. The reviewer is expecting a logical explanation, which is common knowledge in academic writing. So, it's verifiable. It's not just a vague statement but has a clear reasoning behind it. I think this is a 4 because it's mostly supported but could be more detailed. However, since it's a clear claim with logical reasoning, maybe it's a 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking for a clear explanation of the purpose of separators. This is directly helpful because it guides the authors to look into the specific section for more details. It's not vague; it's specific and actionable. So, this should be a 5 because it's highly helpful and provides clear guidance.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, I'm a bit unsure. The reviewer is asking for an explanation, which is a claim, but does it have supporting evidence? The reviewer is expecting the authors to provide or refer to the paper's context. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's based on common knowledge, but it's not explicitly citing external references. Maybe it's a 4 because it's mostly verifiable but could be more robust with references. Alternatively, if it's relying on the authors' existing knowledge, it's fully verifiable. Hmm, I think it's a 5 because it's a clear claim with logical reasoning, even if no external references are provided.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nActionability: 4\nGrounding Specificity: 5\nVerifiability: 5\nHelpfulness: 5\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says, \"There could be different approaches to pooling the tokens. For instance, why is it that mean pooling works? What about other pooling strategies?\" It's asking the authors to consider other pooling methods but doesn't specify what to do next. So, it's not giving explicit instructions on how to change their approach. It's more of a suggestion without concrete steps, so I think this is **Borderline Actionable** because it hints at an action but doesn't detail how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions \"different approaches to pooling the tokens\" and asks about \"mean pooling\" and \"other pooling strategies.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to, like a particular section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. It's vague about the specific part, so this is **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a suggestion about pooling strategies but isn't providing any evidence or justification. It's just recommending other methods without supporting why mean pooling works or why other strategies might be better. So, this is **Unverifiable** because there's no backing to validate the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential improvement area by suggesting different pooling methods. It's helpful because it identifies an area for the authors to explore. However, it's quite vague and doesn't provide much guidance, so it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this as **Somewhat Helpful** because it does suggest an improvement but lacks depth.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

This is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors what to do. However, it doesn't provide concrete details on how to calculate or present these costs. So, it's not fully actionable because the method isn't specified. I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" since the action is clear but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions \"real search cost (e.g., in terms of GPU days)\" and \"Table 3\". This clearly identifies the specific part of the paper (Table 3) and what aspect (real search cost). It's fully grounded because it accurately points to the section and provides a specific metric. The specificity is also good as it tells the authors exactly what to look at in the table.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment is making a suggestion, which is a claim. It's supported by the idea that comparing GPU days is a logical and common practice in search cost analysis. There's no need for external references here, but the reasoning is clear and logical. So, this should be \"Fully Verifiable\" because the claim is well-supported with logical reasoning.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point suggests a specific improvement, which is helpful for the authors. It guides them on what additional data to include in their table. While it doesn't provide examples of how to present GPU days, it's still actionable and relevant. Therefore, it's \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it's clear and provides meaningful feedback, though it could be more detailed.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: 5 (Fully Verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 4 (Mostly Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It also suggests a comparison, which is a specific aspect. The grounding is strong because it references particular works and the nature of the discussion. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting the inclusion of these works and the need for a discussion. It provides some justification by mentioning the importance of comparing with other works, which is logical reasoning.

It's explicit, so that's good. Now, is it concrete? The comment doesn't specify exactly what to replace it with, just to be more objective. So it's explicit but not very concrete because it doesn't give examples or exact replacements. So I think this is 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is suggesting a change in terminology. It doesn't mention any specific part of the paper, just the axes being squished and the improvement being difficult to characterize as remarkable.

It's a statement of a problem without a solution or suggestion. So, it's not explicit or concrete.

The review mentions pruning and GPUs but doesn't reference a specific part of the paper. It's a general statement without pinpointing an issue or section. So, the grounding is weak because it can't accurately identify the referenced part. It's not grounded at all, so the grounding_specificity is not grounded.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that pruning isn't efficient on GPUs.

The review mentions that the method isn't convincing because it's tested on synthetic data and lacks comparison with [5]. It doesn't specify what action the authors should take, like suggesting an alternative method or improvement. So, it's more of an implicit suggestion rather than explicit. Therefore, it's not highly actionable or even somewhat actionable. It might be borderline actionable because it does hint at an issue but doesn't clearly instruct on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about the method's limitations but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It doesn't mention synthetic data or the comparison with [5] in a way that clearly identifies the issue. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint where the problem lies. It's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review points out that the method is only tested on synthetic data and lacks comparison with [5]. This is a claim that needs justification.

The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue, so that's clear. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly where to look (Figure 6) and what the problem is (font size too small). So it's not just a suggestion but a direct action. Therefore, it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to Figure 6, which is specific. The reviewer is pointing out a particular part of the paper, so the grounding is strong. It's not a vague comment about the figure in general but specifically about Figure 6. Therefore, it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to Verifiability. The comment is a claim because it's suggesting a change (improving font size). Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out an issue, but there's no justification or reasoning provided. They're just stating that the font is small.

For example, it doesn't say whether to use a different PMF for each tree or how to adjust the parameters. So, while the action is clear, the details are vague. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think a 4 here because it's implicit but concrete in the request, just lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests revising the discussion, especially in the modeling section. It mentions not being clear enough and suggests a better formalization. The action is clear\u2014revising the modeling section. But the instructions say to make it explicit or implicit. Here, the action is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do: revise the modeling section. It doesn't ask them to infer anything. So, this is explicit. Now, is it concrete? The suggestion is to formalize the architecture, which is specific. It doesn't just say revise; it gives a direction. So, it's concrete. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the modeling section, which is specific. It doesn't just say \"the paper\" but points to a particular part. The comment also specifies what needs improvement: a better formalization. So, it's grounded because it refers to a specific section and clearly states what's wrong. Therefore, this is a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about the current formalization being unclear and suggesting an improvement. It's a claim because it's making a judgment. Now, is this claim verifiable? The suggestion is to formalize the architecture, but the review doesn't provide specific references or reasoning. It's vague on how to implement the change. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's making a claim, but the justification is lacking. Therefore, this would be a 3 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is pointing out a specific area for improvement and suggests a particular change. It's clear and actionable, but it doesn't go into detail about how to formalize the architecture. It's helpful but not the most detailed. So, this would be a 4 for helpfulness.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, the claim is that the current formalization is unclear, but the review doesn't back this up with evidence or references. So, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe it's a 2? Because it's making a claim but without sufficient support. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. The definitions say that if a claim is made, it's verifiable if supported by reasoning, references, or external sources. Here, the review doesn't provide any of that. So, it's not fully verifiable, but it's a claim. So, maybe 2? Or is it 3 because it's somewhat verifiable? I think since it's a claim without support, it's borderline, so 2.\n\nWait, no, the definitions say that if a claim is made, it's verifiable if supported. If there's no support, it's unverifiable. So, since the review doesn't provide any justification, it's unverifiable. So, 1 for verifiability.\n\nBut wait, the claim is that the current formalization is unclear, which is a judgment. The review doesn't back this up with evidence or references, so it's not verifiable. So, 1.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's 2 because it's a claim, but without any support, it's borderline. Hmm, perhaps 1 is more accurate because there's no justification provided.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nActionability: 5\n\nGrounding_specificity: 5\n\nVerifiability: 1\n\nHelpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

The comment is explicit about the need for clarification and provides a clear action\u2014asking for evidence and comparison. So, it's explicit and concrete. I think this is highly actionable because it tells the authors exactly what to do and how to do it.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the residual term by name and mentions sparsity, which is a specific aspect of the paper. It doesn't just say \"the residual term is unclear,\" which would be weakly grounded. Here, it's specific about the term and what's unclear about it, so it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that the authors should provide evidence and compare with existing methods. It supports this claim by explaining why these actions are necessary. The reasoning is clear and provides sufficient justification, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is asking for specific improvements and comparisons, which directly helps the authors by guiding them on what to add. It's clear and actionable, so it's highly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 5 because the review point is explicit, specific, well-supported, and directly helpful to the authors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review points out that 'connectivity' is misleading because it doesn't use structural connections. Is this an explicit action? Yes, it clearly states that 'connectivity' is misleading. It doesn't ask the author to do anything, just points out the issue. So, it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer explains that 'connectivity' isn't using structural connections, but it doesn't tell the author exactly how to fix it. So, it's explicit but not concrete. Therefore, on a scale of 1 to 5, I'd give it a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions 'connectivity' and explains it's misleading because it doesn't use structural connections. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or section is affected. The author might not know where to look or what exactly needs to be changed. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific part. It's more of a general critique without pinpointing the issue. So, grounding_specificity would be a 2.\n\nFor verifiability, the review makes a claim that 'connectivity' is misleading. It supports this by stating that it doesn't use structural connections. This explanation is logical and provides a clear justification. It references common knowledge about terminology and structural aspects. So, it's thoroughly supported. Verifiability would be a 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review clearly identifies an issue and provides a straightforward explanation. It doesn't ask the author to do anything beyond recognizing the problem, so it's not asking for clarification. The feedback is direct and gives the author a clear direction on what's wrong. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. So, helpfulness would be a 4.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 3, grounding_specificity: 2, verifiability: 5, helpfulness: 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

But it doesn't specify what exactly needs to be done. So, the action is implicit. The authors still don't know how to fix it. That makes it borderline actionable because it's vague.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review refers to \"related work,\" \"experiment,\" and \"writing\" without pointing to specific sections or elements. It's a bit vague, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify which part needs improvement, so it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the paper isn't polished and lacks details.

It's vague about the actions the authors should take, like whether they need to modify their weight matrices or if there's a specific method to validate the use of orthogonal matrices. So, it's not giving clear instructions, which makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think this would be a 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to orthogonal matrices but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model it's addressing. It talks about the transpose and the transpose of the matrix but doesn't clearly link this to the local window MLP. The grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact section or figure.

It's explicit about the issue and the possible cause, so that's clear. But does it give concrete steps on what to do? It just mentions overfitting without suggesting how to fix it, like regularization or cross-validation. So it's explicit but lacks concrete actions. I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to Figure 5 by name, which is specific. It mentions overfitting, which is a general concept but not tied to the figure. The grounding is clear because it's pointing to a specific part of the paper. So this should be **4: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the claim is that accuracy drops due to overfitting. The reasoning is that overfitting is a common concept, so it's supported by common knowledge. There's no external reference, but it's a logical explanation. So this is **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and suggests a possible cause. It's clear and provides a reason for the observed phenomenon.

The reviewer doesn't specify how to implement these changes or what results to expect. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on actions, making it somewhat actionable. I'd give it a 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions specific models and datasets, which clearly pinpoints the issue. They also ask about language tasks, which is a specific area. So, this is fully grounded because they're pointing to specific parts of the paper and asking about a particular concern. That's a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the models/datasets are toy-like. They support this by suggesting alternatives, which are well-known benchmarks and architectures. They also ask a question about language tasks, which is a logical follow-up. The evidence is solid, so this is fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

It also points out that a crucial baseline is missing and questions the argument against pretraining. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is suggesting a specific experiment ( ScratchGAN without pretraining) and asking a direct question about the baseline. That seems pretty explicit. It also provides a clear action: conducting that experiment. So, it's not just a vague suggestion but a specific action the authors can take. Therefore, this should be **Highly Actionable** (5).\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to natural ablation studies and specifically asks about ScratchGAN. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed\u2014likely the section discussing ablation studies or the comparison with other models. The specificity is good because it's not just a general statement but specifically about a known aspect of the work. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific** (5).\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that a crucial baseline is missing. They're suggesting that conducting the experiment would provide evidence. The justification is logical\u2014without this baseline, the argument against pretraining is weaker.

It mentions padding the shorter sequence by replicating the last state and the lack of a normalization factor. The comment is explicit about the action the authors should take, which is to clarify their method. It also provides some details, like the padding method and the normalization issue. However, it doesn't give explicit instructions on how to implement the normalization factor, so the authors might need to infer it. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully explicit. So, I'd rate this as 4: Mostly Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions padding the last state and discusses normalization factors. It clearly references specific parts of the code, like the lack of a 1/T factor. The grounding is strong because it points to specific code lines and the impact on trajectory comparison. The specificity is good because it explains the implications of not normalizing by the sequence length. So, this should be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the authors should explain their padding method and normalization. It supports this claim by explaining why the normalization is important and how it affects the comparison. It references common knowledge about trajectory comparison in domains like Atari games. The reasoning is logical and provides sufficient justification without needing external references.

The details about the pruning strategy in self-attention layers are concrete, so the reviewer is giving specific instructions. That makes it actionable and specific, so I'd rate this as 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer specifically mentions Vision Transformer and ImageNet, which are well-known and specific parts of the paper. They also ask about pruning strategies in self-attention layers, which is a precise area. So the grounding is strong because it clearly points to specific sections and aspects of the work. I think this is a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the author didn't consider Vision Transformer.

So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that the proof technique has a special case and that normalization affects Theorem 1's applicability. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning beyond what's in the paper. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. That would be **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a limitation in the proof technique and references a specific section.

It mentions that GDSS doesn't explicitly have a conditional framework but points to a recent work that does. The comment is clear about the action of comparing models but doesn't specify exactly how to implement this comparison. It's a bit vague on the steps, so I think this is **Borderline Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't give detailed instructions.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to GDSS and a specific recent work [2]. It accurately mentions the models and the framework, so it's fully grounded. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is the conditional generation task. So this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment includes a claim that GDSS should be compared as a baseline. It provides a reference to recent work, which supports the claim. The justification is logical and references an external source, so this is **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a clear weakness in GDSS by referencing another study and suggests a specific improvement.

It's not just a general statement; it's pointing to specific areas and metrics. So, the grounding is full, and the specificity is high because it's talking about specific metrics and benchmarks. That would be a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests that colorization pre-training isn't suitable and mentions IoU metrics. It's making a claim that colorization isn't good for object detection, and it's supported by the use of specific metrics like IoU. This is verifiable because it's backed by established metrics.

It mentions that image encoders need to produce meaningful embeddings for new concepts. It then points out that for geometrically distinctive concepts, DINO representations are good, but for those where class labels are more semantic than geometric, the authors' concern is valid. The reviewer is asking for clarification on whether the model's adaptation capacity still holds.\n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is asking a question, which is a form of action. They're prompting the authors to explain if the model can handle new concepts beyond geometry. So, it's explicit. But is it concrete? The reviewer isn't giving a specific action, just a question. So, it's explicit but vague. Therefore, it's borderline actionable. Maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer is talking about the adaptation capacity of the model, specifically about image encoders producing embeddings for new concepts. They mention DINO representations and the correlation between class labels and geometry. The comment is pretty specific about the model's capabilities and the nature of the concepts. The grounding is clear because it's referring to specific parts of the model and the nature of the concepts. So, this is fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5.\n\nVerifiability.

It makes strong assumptions about the coverage of the initial data. The reviewer suggests at least discussing the limitations. \n\nFor Actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue and suggesting a discussion, which is explicit. However, they don't tell the authors exactly what to do next. They just mention the limitation and suggest discussing it. So it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out how to address the limitation. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment refers to partitioning in the first iteration and the assumption about data coverage. It mentions the initial data, which is specific. The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the methodology and its implications. So the grounding is solid because it clearly references a specific part of the paper. The specificity is also good because it explains what the limitation is. So this would be a 5.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is making a claim by stating that freezing partitioning is risky and making assumptions about data coverage. It then suggests discussing the limitations. The suggestion is clear and provides a direction for the authors to take. There's no external reference needed here; it's more of a logical suggestion based on common knowledge in data partitioning. So this is fully verifiable, giving it a 5.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer points out a specific limitation and suggests discussing it, which is helpful for the authors. It gives them a clear area to consider without being too vague. It's not the most detailed, but it's sufficient to guide the authors in improving their work.

So, it's not giving any explicit actions or concrete suggestions. That means it's not actionable because the authors don't know what to do or how to improve. So, on a scale of 1 to 5, this would be 1: Unactionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review point is referring to Section 5.2 without pointing out exactly which part of the paper it's talking about. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint which specific section or issue is being addressed. So, this is weak grounding because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. Therefore, it's 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the review point is just stating a question about the intent of a section. There's no claim or suggestion made, so it doesn't require any justification or evidence. It's just a factual statement, so it's not verifiable. That would be a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review point is asking a question without providing any meaningful feedback or suggestions. It doesn't help the authors by improving their draft because there's no actionable advice.

The comment suggests a problem but doesn't provide specific actions or solutions. It's vague about how to address the issue or what changes are needed. So, this is borderline actionable because it hints at a problem but lacks concrete steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to \"fully realistic datasets\" and mentions the difficulty in controlling variations. It doesn't specify which part of the paper or analysis this affects. The authors might not know exactly where the issue lies, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the specific aspect being addressed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a judgment that there's no immediate societal impact. It doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. It's a subjective opinion without supporting references, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential limitation but doesn't offer constructive suggestions or improvements.

It also points out that the figure is hard to understand and suggests dashed lines are vague. The actionable parts are clear\u2014mentioning Gittins and the posterior as a Markov chain. However, the suggestion about the figure being vague isn't very specific on how to improve it. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but lacks specifics on the figure.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to Gittins strategy and posterior evolution, which are specific parts of the paper. It also mentions the figure and dashed lines, which are specific elements. So, it's fully grounded because it accurately points to the sections and elements being discussed. The specificity is good because it clearly states what's wrong with the figure. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review mentions Gittins strategy and posterior as a Markov chain, which are well-known concepts, so that's logical reasoning. It also references the figure's unclear explanation, which could be supported by external knowledge about how to improve figure clarity. So, it's thoroughly supported, making it **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions about the bandit algorithms and the figure's clarity. It's specific and actionable, which is very helpful for the authors. It doesn't seem vague or lacking in guidance.

The review point says, \"For clarity, it would be better if the evaluation metric is mentioned here to better understand the scale of the improvement; this would also be helpful to understand the results reported in this paper for comparability: the expression \u201clabelled F-measure scores (LF1) (including ROOT arcs)\u201d was used in Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez and G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez (2020).\" \n\nHmm, the reviewer is suggesting adding more clarity by specifying the evaluation metric. They mention F-measure scores and ROOT arcs, which are specific metrics. So, the action here is suggesting a specific change, which is explicit. But is it concrete? The reviewer isn't just saying \"improve clarity,\" they're giving a precise example of what to include. So, this seems like an explicit action with concrete details. Therefore, it's highly actionable because the reviewer is not only suggesting a change but also providing exactly what needs to be added.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper\u2014the evaluation metric section\u2014so they're clearly identifying which part needs improvement. They're not just making a vague comment about clarity but specifically referencing the metrics. This means they're fully grounded because they're pinpointing a specific section. Additionally, they're providing a clear suggestion about what to include, so it's specific. Therefore, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that adding specific metrics would improve clarity. They're providing a clear recommendation based on their understanding of what makes evaluations clearer. They're not citing external references, but their reasoning is logical and based on common practices in research evaluation. So, their claim is well-supported, making it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is providing a specific and actionable suggestion. They're not just pointing out a problem but also offering a solution. This makes their comment helpful because it gives the authors a clear direction on what to do. It's not just vague advice but a concrete improvement plan, so it's highly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at the highest level\u2014actionable, grounded and specific, verifiable, and helpful.

Also, it's concrete because it specifies the exact change. So this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to the standard deviation of the noise as being 3. It doesn't mention any specific part of the paper beyond that. It's a general statement without pinpointing a section or figure.

It's not just a general comment but points to exact elements, making it well-grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the suggestions are based on common practices in vector normalization and similarity measures. The user is referring to standard methods, so this is supported by existing knowledge. It's logical and provides clear guidance, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is very detailed, addressing multiple areas the authors might need to improve. It's not just a superficial critique but provides substantial feedback.

It also points out that running multiple experiments is critical and should be reported with statistics. The explicit action here is to run multiple experiments, which is clear. The suggestion to report statistics adds more detail, making it concrete. So, this seems highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do and how to apply it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about reproducibility and the need for multiple experiments. It references a specific paper [a] by Henderson et al. The grounding is strong because it mentions a specific paper, and the issue of multiple experiments is clearly addressed. The specificity comes from the mention of statistics and the referenced work, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review includes a reference to a specific paper, which is a good source of external support. It also explains why reproducibility is important and suggests running multiple experiments, which adds logical reasoning.

It mentions that the authors did the observation, so that's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It suggests they should make the text clearer, but it doesn't specify how. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, Grounding_specificity. The review refers to lines 293-295, which is specific. It also mentions that the authors did the observation, which is a clear pinpoint. So the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the part of the paper being discussed. That should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nVerifiability. The review claims that the text is unclear because the authors manually observed the examples. Is this claim supported? Well, it's a subjective judgment. The authors might disagree with the clarity, but there's no external reference or logical reasoning provided. So it's a claim without much support. Maybe a 2 for verifiability since it's claimed but not fully justified.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review points out that the text is unclear and suggests the authors make it clearer.

It points out Lemma 3 specifically. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out issues but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They mention the lack of clean logic but don't specify how to improve it. So, it's implicit. Since it's not giving clear steps, it's not actionable. So, this should be 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions Lemma 3 but doesn't specify what exactly is wrong with it. It's a general statement about the proof's organization and logic. The reviewer doesn't point out a unique aspect or a specific part of Lemma 3 that needs improvement. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pinpointing the issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity is 2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the proof is not well-organized. The reviewer provides some reasoning about the lack of clean logic and the difficulty in checking rigor. However, it's vague and doesn't cite specific examples or references.

Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is making a statement about the similarity, which implies that the approach is not novel. But does this tell the authors exactly what to do? It suggests that the method isn't new, but it doesn't provide a clear action or fix. So, it's more of an implicit comment.

So, it's clear what needs to be done, but the method is vague. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions specific tasks like language modeling and tasks from COCO-LM. It accurately points out the areas where the current experiments fall short. So, it's fully grounded because it's specific about the parts of the paper it's addressing. The specificity is also good because it clearly states what's missing. So, this would be a 5.\n\nFor Verifiability, the review is making a claim that the current experiments don't reflect the capability of language models.

It's explicit because it clearly states the dependency. But does it give concrete details on how to apply this? It mentions the features but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next, like changing their analysis methods. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. That would make it 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to \"method/features used for answer detection\" like POS and dependency parses. It's specific about the features, so the grounding is strong. It clearly mentions the parts of the paper that need attention, so this is 4: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nVerifiability.

The comment is explicit about the action\u2014adding datasets and encoding. It also provides concrete details, like the specific issue with one-hot encoding. So, this is both explicit and concrete. I think this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific datasets and the lack of one-hot encoding. It accurately points out the problem without overgeneralizing. The grounding is solid because it references the exact part of the paper. So, this should be a high score too, probably 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides clear reasoning. It explains why categorical features are important and why one-hot encoding is necessary. It doesn't just state a problem but also gives a logical reason. There's no need for external references here, but the explanation is thorough. So, this should be a high score, maybe 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is very specific about the issues and provides actionable suggestions. It helps the authors understand where to make improvements without being vague. This is definitely highly helpful, so a 5 makes sense.\n\nI don't see any borderline cases here. Each aspect is clearly defined and the review point does a great job in each category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

The review mentions that the datasets are unpopular and weird choices, suggesting that the authors should have chosen better options. It gives examples like wearable health or mobile activity recognition data. This is explicit because it tells the authors what to do\u2014replace the datasets. It's also concrete because it specifies alternative datasets. So, this should be a high score on actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific datasets by name, like FlatCam Face [26] and Head-pose detection [11], and mentions other potential datasets like those from UCI. This means the authors can pinpoint exactly which parts of the paper are being discussed. It's fully grounded because it references specific sections and provides clear suggestions. So, grounding_specificity should be high.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides references to the datasets and suggests alternative sources. It's logical and well-supported by external references, so this is fully verifiable. The claims are justified with examples and citations, making it highly verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review clearly identifies weaknesses in the dataset choices and provides actionable suggestions. It's detailed and constructive, offering specific alternatives.

It suggests this could break acceleration techniques like quantization and sparsification. \n\nFor actionability, it's about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. The review explicitly states the issue (not mentioning global Q values) and suggests a problem with acceleration techniques. However, it doesn't provide concrete steps on what the authors should do next. They might need to look into global Q values or compare with average gradients. So, it's explicit but lacks specific guidance on how to implement the fix. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to large networks and acceleration techniques but doesn't specify which part of the paper or unique aspect it's addressing. It mentions general issues without pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the referenced part. It's more of a general critique rather than pinpointing an issue. Therefore, it's **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that not mentioning global Q values could break acceleration techniques. It provides some reasoning about how this might affect quantization and sparsification. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't give concrete references or examples. The reasoning is logical but lacks specific evidence or citations. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue with pruning and suggests the authors check global Q values. It's clear and provides actionable feedback, but it's somewhat general. The authors might need more specific guidance on where to look or how to proceed.

It also points out a potential concern about increasing false positives. The comment suggests that this should be a substantial part of the discussion. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. Here, the reviewer is making an explicit action by pointing out a potential concern, which is good. However, the suggestion to make this a substantial part of the discussion is a bit vague. The reviewer isn't giving a specific action beyond mentioning the concern, so it's not fully actionable. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear that there's a concern but doesn't provide detailed guidance on how to address it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to the dropout probe and its impact on sensitivity. It mentions a causal role and a potential concern about false positives. The reviewer is addressing a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is clear. The specificity is about how well the issue is detailed. The reviewer does explain the concern but doesn't provide examples or references, so it's somewhat specific. I think this would be **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does address a specific part but doesn't elaborate on the concern.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment contains a claim that increasing false positives is a concern.

The action here is pointing out a missing part, which is the regret bound. But is this explicit or implicit? The comment is clear about the missing part, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer says the authors didn't find it, but they don't explain how to fix it. So, it's explicit but vague on how to apply the fix. That would make it borderline actionable, which is a 2.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer mentions the regret bound in the appendix but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. They also don't provide specific details about what's missing. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly pointing to a specific section or element. The specificity is also low since they don't explain what needs to be addressed. So, this would be weakly grounded and not specific, which is a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim that the authors didn't find the regret bound in the supplementary. They support this by stating that they didn't find it, which is a factual statement. There's no external reference or reasoning provided, so it's not verifiable. This would be unverifiable, a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer points out that the authors missed a specific part but doesn't suggest how to address it.

It suggests fixing the style to gain space and include NLP experiments in the main body. \n\nFor actionability, it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The review explicitly states the issues with the formatting, so that's clear. It also suggests specific fixes, like adjusting the margins and font, which are concrete actions. Additionally, it provides guidance on where to include the NLP experiments, which is a direct action. Since both the problem and the solution are clearly stated, it's highly actionable. So I'd give this a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out specific formatting issues in the abstract font and margins. It doesn't mention any other parts of the paper, so the grounding is pretty strong. The comment is specific about the sections it's addressing, which means the authors can easily identify where the problems are. The specificity is also good because it clearly states what needs to be fixed. So this should be a 5 as well.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review claims that fixing the formatting will allow the authors to include NLP experiments in the main body and gain space. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to back up why adjusting the margins and font size would solve these problems. It's more of a suggestion without solid justification. Therefore, the verifiability is low. I'd rate this a 1 because there's no strong evidence to support the claims made.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers specific suggestions about formatting issues and where to place the experiments. However, it doesn't elaborate on how these changes will actually help, like explaining the benefits of adjusting the margins or why the font size is too large.

The review refers to multi-scale methods and mentions skip connections [10], which is a specific reference. It does point out areas where the authors should provide more details or explanations. However, it's a bit vague about what exactly needs to be added. So, the grounding is clear enough, but the specificity in explaining what needs to be addressed isn't very detailed. I think this is **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes claims about the appropriateness of subjective statements, the need for proofs, and the sensitivity of image recovery to architecture choices. It references a specific paper, which adds credibility. However, the reasoning is a bit vague, and it doesn't provide clear examples or logical justifications for all the points. It's somewhat supported but not fully robust. So, I'd give this a **3: Somewhat Verifiable** score.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review does point out issues and suggests improvements but lacks concrete details and examples. It's clear that the authors need to add proofs and references but doesn't specify how or where. The mention of skip connections is a helpful hint, but overall, it's not very detailed. I think this is **3: Somewhat Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2: Borderline Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3: Weakly Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3: Somewhat Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3: Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the review point \"3) How does the proposed method compare with prior art?\" based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point is asking about the comparison with prior art. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next, like suggesting specific changes or improvements. It's more of a general question, so it's not providing clear actions. Therefore, it's not highly actionable or even somewhat actionable. It might be borderline because it's asking a question, but without a direct action, it's probably not actionable at all. So, I'd rate this as 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review point mentions prior art but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper or section it's referring to. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know exactly where to look or what specific issues to address. So, it's not fully grounded because it's not pointing to a specific section or element. It's more of a general statement, so grounding_specificity would be 3, which is weakly grounded and specific. Wait, no, actually, the definition says weak grounding is when the author can't confidently identify the referenced part. Since it's referring to prior art in general, it's weakly grounded. But since it's not providing specific details, it's not specific either. Hmm, maybe it's weakly grounded and not specific. But looking at the scale, weakly grounded and not specific would be 2. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's weakly grounded and specific because it's implying the relevant parts without naming them. I think I'll go with 3, which is weakly grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review point is making a judgment about comparing with prior art, which is a claim. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for why prior art is relevant or how it affects the current method. It's just stating a fact without backing it up. So, it's unverifiable. Therefore, verifiability would be 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is asking about prior art but doesn't provide any specific feedback or suggestions. It's a question that doesn't help the authors improve their work. It's not giving them actionable steps or insights. So, it's not helpful at all. Therefore, helpfulness would be 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 1\n- Grounding_specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 1\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}

It's a good suggestion, but does it give clear actions? It says \"some analyses can be more detailed\" and gives an example. It doesn't specify exactly what to do, like which analyses to enhance or how to compare the languages. So, it's explicit in suggesting improvement but vague on the details. That makes it **Borderline Actionable** because it's clear there's a need for more detail but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"language/nationality\" and mentions 20 types, which is specific. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed\u2014the analysis section related to language and nationality. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the section. The specificity is also good because it mentions the exact variables and the number of types.

It's not a factual statement but an opinion or recommendation. The suggestion is clear and logical\u2014comparing different languages could reveal interesting biases. There's no external reference needed, but the reasoning is solid. So, it's **Somewhat Verifiable** because it's supported by logical reasoning but doesn't cite external sources.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a potential area for improvement and suggests a specific analysis.

It's explicit about the question, so that's good. It also mentions illustrating with numerical examples, which gives a clear action. So, it's explicit and concrete. I think this is highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to Hamiltonian systems, which is a specific part of the paper. It's not vague or too general. So, the grounding is solid. It also clearly states what needs to be addressed, which is conservation properties. That makes it well-grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The comment suggests looking into symplectic integrators and provides examples. It's making a claim by suggesting that F^\u2020 can conserve properties, which requires justification. The reasoning is logical, and the references to symplectic integrators are specific.

It seems like the reviewer is making a suggestion about what tasks should be included, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer isn't giving specific steps or how to implement this suggestion. They're just stating that a variety of tasks beyond link predict should be considered.

The review suggests expanding the related work section and comparing to strong baselines. It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. But is it concrete? It says to compare to strong baselines using coordinates, which gives a clear direction. So I think this is highly actionable because it's explicit and provides detailed instructions.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions related work and strong baselines but doesn't specify which part of the paper or which sections. It's a bit vague because it doesn't point to a specific section or provide unique elements. So the grounding isn't fully there, but it's not weak either. Maybe it's somewhat grounded because it's clear where the issue is, but not specific about the details.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim because it suggests adding comparisons. It needs justification, like why this comparison is important or how it adds value. The review doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, so it's not fully verifiable. It's more of a suggestion without solid backing, so maybe it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment is clear and suggests a specific improvement, which is helpful.

It suggests using multiple seeds for a more robust evaluation. The action here is clear: move from single to multiple seeds. It's explicit, so that's good. The suggestion is concrete because it tells the authors exactly what to do. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out a specific issue with the experiments, mentioning single seed training. It clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, which is the experimental methodology. It doesn't mention external work, so it's not providing specific examples, but it's still grounded because it refers to a specific part. So, this is fully grounded but not specific in terms of examples.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that single seed experiments are limiting. It supports this by suggesting multiple seeds, which is a logical reasoning. It doesn't cite external references, but the reasoning is clear and logical. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it has some justification but lacks external references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a clear weakness in the experimental setup and provides a constructive suggestion.

The motivation behind this is unclear to me.\" The comment is asking for clarification on why these specific distributions were chosen. It's not giving a direct action or suggestion, so it's not explicit. It's more of a question, which might be considered implicit. Since the reviewer is asking a question but not providing a clear solution or action, it's not very actionable. So, I'd rate this as 2: Borderline Actionable because it does suggest an action (clarification) but doesn't give much detail on how to proceed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is asking about the motivation for using these distributions. It's not pointing to a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is weak.

Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 2 because it's weakly grounded but not specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is suggesting adding an overview. There's no claim here; it's just a request. Since it's a normal statement without any supporting evidence, it's not verifiable. So, verifiability would be 1 because it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is asking for an overview but doesn't provide any specific details or suggestions on how to implement it.

So, it's not giving clear actions, making it somewhat actionable but not fully. I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to the statistical dimension d_lambda and mentions ridge regression. It's clear which part of the paper it's talking about, so the grounding is good. It also explains the issue clearly, so specificity is high. I'll give this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review points out a potential issue with computing d_lambda and its impact on bias. It references ridge regression, which is a common method, so it's well-supported. The reasoning is logical, and it cites a relevant concept. This should be fully verifiable, so I'll score it as 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment raises a valid concern about computational complexity and bias.

So, this is **Fully Grounded and Specific (5)** because it accurately identifies the section and clearly states the comparison.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that when the number of classes is large, the noise rate is lower. It doesn't provide any justification or references. It just states the observation. So, there's no supporting evidence, making it **Unverifiable (1)**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out an interesting finding but doesn't offer actionable advice. It tells the authors that there's a relationship but doesn't suggest what to do next. Without clear recommendations, it's not very helpful. So, I'd rate this as **Somewhat Helpful (3)** because it does inform the authors of a potential issue, but it doesn't guide them on how to address it.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests comparing the model trained on the original dataset with the mixture. This is explicit, so it's clear what needs to be done. The action is to compare these datasets, and the method is specified, so it's concrete. Therefore, this is highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment references Section 3.1 and specific datasets (original vs. adversarial). It accurately points to the relevant part of the paper, so grounding is full. It also clearly explains what needs to be addressed, making specificity high. Thus, it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests a comparison that's logical and based on common knowledge about model training. It doesn't require external references, so it's thoroughly supported. This makes it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions for improvement, compares specific datasets, and emphasizes the importance of the experiment.

That would be borderline actionable because it hints at an issue but doesn't tell how to fix it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to \"CNN experiments\" but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It's too vague, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify where the problem is, just that the experiments aren't convincing.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment says the experiments aren't convincing but doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable. It lacks the necessary backing to be considered fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a problem but doesn't suggest improvements. It's vague and doesn't guide the authors on what changes to make.

It suggests that the authors should mention this. This is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors what to do\u2014they should clarify their methodology. It's not vague; it's straightforward. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to \"model (3) (Chung et al. 2016) for Cs-En\" and mentions that the results were computed by the authors. This clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being discussed, which is the results section related to model (3). It also specifies what's wrong and what needs to be addressed. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the authors should mention how they computed the results. It provides a logical reasoning by pointing out that the authors should clarify their methodology. There's no external reference needed here, but the reasoning is clear and logical. So, this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear feedback that the authors should mention their computation of the results. It's actionable and constructive, helping the authors improve their paper by being transparent about their methodology.

The review mentions \"prompt design\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs improvement. It's a general suggestion without pointing to a specific section or issue. So, the grounding is weak because it can't confidently identify the referenced part. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific, which is a 2.\n\nFor Verifiability, the review doesn't provide any justification or evidence. It just suggests improving prompt design but doesn't explain why or how. There's no claim here because it's more of a suggestion without backing. So, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review offers a suggestion but it's vague. It tells the author where to focus but doesn't provide details on how to do that.

The review says, \"You could compare your result with SoTA approaches, for example with HateXplain models.\" I need to check if this is explicit or implicit. It seems like the reviewer is suggesting a comparison but isn't giving a specific action. They're implying that the authors should do something, but not exactly what. So, it's implicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer isn't providing any specific steps or details on how to compare with SoTA approaches. They just mention the idea. So, it's vague. Therefore, this review is borderline actionable because it suggests an action but doesn't specify how to take it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"SoTA approaches\" and \"HateXplain models.\" I'm not sure if the authors can pinpoint exactly which part of their paper this refers to. It's a bit vague. The grounding here is weak because the reviewer isn't clearly pointing out a specific section or figure in the paper. They're just making a general suggestion, so the grounding isn't strong.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review is making a claim by suggesting a comparison with another model. Is this claim supported? Well, comparing with another model is a common practice, so it's a general statement. There's no specific evidence or references provided, so it's not fully verifiable. It's more of a suggestion without much justification, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

It might be somewhat actionable if it were more specific, but as it stands, it's borderline because the action is vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions hyperparameters but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It doesn't point to a specific section, table, or figure. The reviewer is making a general comment about the model's components. Since the comment doesn't clearly identify the referenced part, the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't pinpoint where the issue lies. So, this is weakly grounded and not specific because it doesn't provide details on what needs fixing.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that hyperparameters are missing. The reviewer is suggesting a solution, which is a judgment or suggestion. To verify this claim, the reviewer would need to provide justification, like why the missing hyperparameters are problematic or how they affect the model. However, the comment doesn't offer any evidence or reasoning to support why this is an issue. It just states the problem and suggests a possible action without backing it up. So, the verifiability is low. It's not fully verifiable because there's no justification provided.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment points out a weakness (missing hyperparameters) and suggests an action (tracing in the code). However, the suggestion is vague and doesn't provide specific guidance on how to trace or what to look for. The helpfulness is limited because the feedback is incomplete and lacks depth. The authors might understand that hyperparameters are missing but won't know exactly what steps to take next. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully because it doesn't offer detailed actionable steps.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding_specificity: 2 (Weakly Grounded and Not Specific)\n- Verifiability: 1 (Unverifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

The comment suggests the authors should clarify this. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The review directly points out the issue and tells the authors what to do, so that's explicit. Is it concrete? Yes, because it tells them exactly where the problem is and what to fix. So this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"CIFAR-10 improvement of 3%p\" but doesn't specify which part of the paper or figure this refers to. It's a bit vague because it doesn't point to a specific section or table. So the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. Therefore, this is weakly grounded and not specific, which would be a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it suggests the authors should clarify the notation. The justification is that the improvement is unclear, which is a subjective opinion. There's no external reference or logical reasoning provided to back up the claim.

The action here is suggesting a clarification, which is explicit. But does it give a clear action? It tells the authors to clarify the title, but it doesn't specify how. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions the title being ambiguous but doesn't specify which part of the paper that refers to. It doesn't point to a section or figure, so the grounding is weak. It's not grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part.

It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back up this claim. So it's a claim without support, which makes it unverifiable. That's a 1 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a specific issue with the title and giving a clear suggestion to clarify it. It's specific and actionable, so it should be helpful.

It says the CLT guarantees Gaussianity in a non-asymptotic regime and applies to any finite linear combination. The reviewer explains that this is incorrect. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out specific errors in the authors' claim. It's clear what the mistake is, so the authors can directly fix their statement. That seems explicit. Also, the reviewer provides clear examples, like non-asymptotic and finite combinations, which gives the authors exactly what to change. So, this is both explicit and concrete. I think this is highly actionable, so a 5.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions the CLT and explains why the authors' statement is wrong. They don't just say \"the authors are wrong,\" but they reference specific aspects of the CLT. They also give examples, which makes it clear which part of the authors' claim is incorrect. So, the grounding is strong because they pinpoint the issue. The specificity comes from explaining why it's wrong and providing examples. This seems like full grounding and specificity, so another 5.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer's claim is that the authors' statement is incorrect because of the reasons given. They provide logical reasoning, examples, and explanations. This makes the claim well-supported. The evidence is clear and sufficient, so this is fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer not only points out the mistake but also explains why it's wrong and provides examples.

But does it give a direct action? The reviewer is asking the authors to do something, but it doesn't specify how. They just need to analyze the time complexity, which is a bit vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the method isn't detailed. Maybe it's borderline actionable since it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment is about Section 4, which is specific. It doesn't mention any specific part within Section 4, so the grounding is weak. The reviewer is pointing out a general area without pinning it down to a specific figure, table, or paragraph.

They clearly identify the part of the paper (the abstract) and what's missing (evaluation systems for single dialogue systems). This is fully grounded because they mention the specific section and the issue with it.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that arena-based systems aren't suitable for evaluating single systems.

This is supported by common knowledge about how these systems are used, so it's **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer provides a clear critique of the proposed method and suggests alternatives. They explain why the current evaluation systems aren't suitable, which gives the authors a direction to look elsewhere. This is helpful because it guides them to better evaluation methods. It's not the best help, but it's better than vague comments.

The comment suggests that the authors should consider the computational implications and fairness in their comparison. It's explicit about the issue and provides a clear action, so it's actionable. It doesn't seem vague or implicit, so I think it's at least somewhat actionable. Maybe a 4 here.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the training process of RegMixup, specifically mentioning the number of samples and the running speed. It also ties this to the authors' own claim. The grounding is clear because it directly references the method and the specific aspect being discussed. The specificity is good because it explains why the number of samples matters and how it affects the comparison.

The author is asked to define t_R^m, which is a specific part of the equation. There's no ambiguity about which part of the paper is being addressed, so this is fully grounded. The specificity is also high because it directly addresses the unclear part without needing further clarification.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment is making a claim by suggesting that t_R^m should be defined because it's used subsequently. This claim is supported by the fact that the author is pointing out a potential issue with the notation, which is a common practice in academic writing.

It also comments that the authors might only want a unified formula without considering the task differences. \n\nLooking at explicitness, the reviewer is making specific claims about focal loss's behavior in regression, which is an explicit action. However, the suggestion about the weight adjustments for IoU regression is somewhat vague. The reviewer doesn't provide concrete steps on how to adjust the loss or what changes to make. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer refers to focal loss, which is a specific method, so that's fully grounded. They also mention IoU regression, which is a specific aspect of the paper. The specificity is about pointing out a potential issue with applying focal loss to regression. They clearly specify the part of the paper being addressed, so that's fully grounded. They also clearly state what's wrong, so it's specific. That would be a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim about focal loss's behavior in regression. They provide some reasoning, like lower gradients on easy samples causing inaccuracies, but it's not very detailed. They don't cite external references or provide a logical chain of reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable. That would be a 3: Somewhat Verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer points out a potential issue with using focal loss for IoU regression, which is helpful. They suggest that the authors might not have considered the task differences, which could guide them to improve their approach.

It's an explicit action because it directly recommends a different model. But it doesn't provide concrete details on how to implement this change. So, it's not fully actionable because the user would need to know exactly where to make the switch or what differences to expect. So, this seems like a 3: Somewhat Actionable because it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment mentions RoBERTa-base, which is a specific model, so it's fully grounded. It also suggests an improvement, which is specific to the encoder choice.

The comment suggests this leads to confusion. Now, is this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is pointing out the issue but isn't giving a specific fix. They're implying that the authors should clarify the notation, but they don't specify how. So, it's an implicit action because the authors have to infer what needs to be done. Since it's not explicit, it's not highly actionable. Maybe a 3 or 4?

It suggests improvements, which are direct. The comments are explicit about what needs to be fixed and how. So, this seems actionable. I think it's a 5 because it's explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific lines in the paper, like line 143 and 154. It clearly identifies the parts where changes are needed, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is also good because it explains exactly what's wrong and what needs to be done. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides clear reasoning. It points out that in MDPs, rewards are not given after each action, which is a well-known fact. It also explains that actions might not be single features but could be more complex. The suggestions are supported by logical reasoning and common knowledge, so this is fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is very clear and directly addresses the issues. It provides actionable feedback and explains the concepts well, which is helpful for the authors. It's detailed enough to guide them on what changes to make. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nI don't see any borderline cases here. Each aspect is clearly 5 because the review is explicit, well-grounded, fully verifiable, and highly helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review says that ideally, other baselines from [29, 5, 6] should be included in the related work. It mentions that the authors addressed their weaknesses and raised their score because unclear parts were explained. It also suggests adding this to the final version. \n\nLooking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a potential improvement but doesn't specify how to implement it. They mention adding other baselines but don't give a clear method or example. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion. Since it's vague about how to add the baselines, it's not very actionable. So, I'd rate this as 2 for actionability because it's borderline\u2014there's an action implied but no details.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer talks about related work but doesn't specify which parts of the paper they're referring to. They mention \"other baselines\" and \"the authors' explained why the chosen baseline makes the most sense.\" However, they don't clearly identify which sections or aspects of the paper are being discussed. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint the specific part. They do mention what's missing, which is the related work, but without pointing to a specific section, it's not fully grounded. So, I'd give this a 2 as well\u2014weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting the inclusion of other baselines. They provide some reasoning that the authors addressed their weaknesses and raised their score, but this reasoning is vague. They don't cite specific external references or provide clear examples. The justification is there, but it's not detailed enough. So, this falls under somewhat verifiable because there's some support but missing key elements like references or examples.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a potential improvement but doesn't explain why it's important or how it benefits the authors. They mention that the authors raised their score because unclear parts were addressed, but this is more of a consequence than a direct benefit. The suggestion is clear, but the context and impact aren't elaborated, making it somewhat helpful. It's not the most detailed or comprehensive feedback, so I'd rate this a 3.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is borderline, so the scores are 2 for actionability, 2 for grounding, 3 for verifiability, and 3 for helpfulness.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point is asking for an explanation of \u03b4 in Lemma 5. It's explicit because it's directly asking for clarification. However, it's not giving any specific instructions on how to find \u03b4. So, it's not very actionable because the user needs to go look up Lemma 5 themselves. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully because it lacks the concrete steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review point refers to Lemma 5, which is specific. It's not just a vague part of the paper but a specific reference. So, the grounding is strong because it clearly points to Lemma 5. But does it specify what's wrong with \u03b4? It doesn't; it just asks for its definition. So, it's grounded but not specific in explaining the issue with \u03b4.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment is a claim because it's asking for an explanation, which is a request for information. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, asking for an explanation is more of a request than a claim that needs justification. There's no supporting evidence or references provided, so it's not verifiable. It's more of a factual statement than a claim that needs backing.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is asking for clarification on a specific term. It's helpful because it does identify an area that needs understanding. However, it's not providing any actionable steps or depth. It's just a question, so while it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully helpful because it doesn't guide the author on how to improve their work beyond just knowing what \u03b4 is.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 4 (Fully Grounded and Under-Specific)\n- Verifiability: 1 (Unverifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"4\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It provides an example from other works, which is good. But does it tell the author exactly what to do? It says dynamic weighting is important, which is a suggestion, but it doesn't specify how to implement it. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but not concrete on the fix. That makes it somewhat actionable because the author knows there's a problem, but not exactly how to solve it. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions works in multimodal fusion but doesn't specify which ones or how they did it. It's a general statement without pointing to a particular part of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because the author can't pinpoint where the issue is. Therefore, this is 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that dynamic weighting is important, which is a subjective opinion. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this up. So, it's not verifiable because there's no justification or support given. That would be a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a potential issue with the uniform weighting approach and suggests dynamic weighting is better. It's clear and provides a reason why the current method might be flawed. Even though it doesn't give specific implementation details, it's still helpful because it guides the author to consider a different approach.

It doesn't specify what changes should be made, like suggesting adding clarifications or removing redundant phrases. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issue but doesn't give concrete steps. That makes it borderline actionable because it's clear there's a problem but lacks specifics on how to fix it.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions \"a response candidate can meet each utterance\" without pointing to a specific part of the paper. It's a general statement, so the authors can't pinpoint where exactly the issue is. That means it's not fully grounded because it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is a claim that \"a pervasive use of 'to meet' is unclear.\" It doesn't provide any justification or references, so it's unverifiable.

It suggests that this should be clarified. The comment is explicit about the discrepancy and provides a clear action\u2014asking the authors to clarify the terminology. Since the action is direct and specific, it's actionable. There's no vagueness here, so it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points out a specific issue in the figure versus the text. It mentions L_class, which is a clear reference to a specific part of the paper. The grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the part being addressed without needing further clarification. The specificity is also high as it directly addresses the terminology discrepancy.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment doesn't make any claims beyond pointing out the terminology issue. It's more of a factual observation without supporting evidence or justification. Therefore, it's not verifiable because there's no reasoning or references provided to back up the statement.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific issue but doesn't provide any suggestions or improvements.

It's a suggestion, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking the author to check if the network is shallow, but they don't specify how to do that. So it's not very detailed. Maybe it's borderline actionable because it's explicit but vague.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is talking about the network being shallow, which is a specific part of the method. They mention the graph case and the network's depth, so they're accurately pinpointing a specific area. That seems like full grounding because they're clearly referring to a particular part of the paper.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a judgment that the network might be shallow. They're asking the author to check, which is a suggestion. But there's no supporting evidence or references provided. So it's not verifiable. It's more of a suggestion without justification, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is pointing out a limitation and asking the author to consider it.

The comment is explicit about the action of adding machine translation evaluation, so that's clear. It also provides concrete details about the lower uncertainties in machine translation, which gives the authors exactly how to apply the suggestion. So, this is highly actionable because it's both explicit and detailed. I'd give it a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment specifically mentions machine translation as the additional evaluation method. It's not just a general suggestion but clearly points to a specific part of the paper. Also, it explains why this addition is beneficial, which helps the authors understand what needs to be done. So, this is fully grounded and specific. Another 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests machine translation as a reference. While machine translation is a well-known field, the review doesn't provide specific external references or examples. It's more of a general suggestion without concrete evidence or logical reasoning. So, it's somewhat verifiable but lacks depth. Maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment offers a clear suggestion to add machine translation evaluation, which directly addresses the work's limitations.

It's a question, so it's not explicitly stating an action. It's more of a request for information. Therefore, it's not actionable because the authors can't directly apply this information to improve their draft. So, I'd rate this as 1: Unactionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review point is asking about specific details related to the dropout mechanism. It mentions encoder presentation and multiple stochastic masks, which are specific parts of the paper. The grounding here is clear because it's referring to specific technical aspects of the model. However, it's a bit vague because it's just asking for details without providing a specific issue or how it affects the paper. So, I think this is 3: Somewhat Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review point is a question seeking information. There's no claim being made here; it's just asking for details.

Then, it points out missing \u03c4 and \u03b7 in the bracket on line 2, and mentions issues with the Q function on line 4.\n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The reviewer suggests looking at smaller \u03bb values, which is a specific action.

It mentions specific elements like \u03c4 and \u03b7, which are unique parts of the paper. So, the grounding is pretty solid here. The reviewer isn't just talking about the results but specifically points out sections and mentions particular variables, which helps the authors pinpoint the issues.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review makes claims about the performance trend and suggests looking at smaller \u03bb. It's unclear whether these claims are supported by evidence. The performance increase is observed, but there's no justification or references. The suggestions about \u03c4 and \u03b7 are vague and lack specific references or reasoning.

It clearly states the difference between the two figures, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is also high because it directly addresses the figures and their structures. Therefore, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the two figures should be consistent. They're suggesting a change in the model structure. This is a claim, and it's supported by the information provided. The reasoning is logical, and there's no need for external references because it's a straightforward observation. So, this is **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a discrepancy but doesn't provide specific suggestions on how to fix it. It's clear that there's an issue, but the reviewer doesn't offer actionable steps. This makes it somewhat helpful but not fully. So, it should be **Somewhat Helpful**.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: Somewhat Actionable (3)\n- Grounding Specificity: Fully Grounded and Specific (5)\n- Verifiability: Fully Verifiable (5)\n- Helpfulness: Somewhat Helpful (3)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Fully Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

The review mentions that the paper only considered label names, descriptions, and few-shot examples, but claims to have used annotation guidelines. It provides an example from TACRED about city of birth. The comment suggests that the paper's approach might be an overstatement because annotation guidelines are complex and involve rules beyond just label names. \n\nIs this actionable? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a potential issue but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. They mention the complexity of guidelines but don't provide a clear action or suggestion on how to improve the paper. So, it's not explicit or direct.

They mention that the paper didn't consider the complexity of these guidelines, which were curated by linguists. The comment is specific about the example from TACRED, which is a unique aspect of their field.

The first part is a judgment about simplicity, which is a claim. The second part is vague and lacks justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully. I think this is a 3: Somewhat Verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a missing information issue and questions the method's effectiveness. It's clear and provides some actionable feedback, but it's not very detailed. So, it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 3: Somewhat Helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 3\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It also mentions comparing inference speeds. I think the action here is clear: switch to DICOM and compare speeds. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do this? Maybe not entirely. They might need to look into how to use DICOM in their code and where to find the FastMRI dataset. So, it's explicit but not entirely concrete. I'd say it's 4: Mostly Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions DICOM images and the FastMRI dataset. It's pretty specific about the type of image and a recommended dataset. It doesn't leave much ambiguity. So, this should be fully grounded. I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment suggests using DICOM and comparing speeds. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning. It's just a recommendation without backing. So, it's unverifiable. That's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

It also suggests considering the effect of changing the stimulus duration. The comment is explicit in asking for clarification, which is a direct action. It doesn't just say \"clarify,\" but specifically asks about the training method and the impact of stimulus duration. So, this is an explicit action, making it actionable. It doesn't seem vague or require the authors to infer what to do. So, I think this is **Highly Actionable** (5).\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 7 and discusses the stimulus parameters. It's clear which part of the paper it's referring to, so the grounding is explicit. It also talks about the effect of changing the cycle duration, which is a specific aspect of the model training. The specificity is good because it's not just a general question but directly relates to the methodology. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific** (5).\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that altering the stimulus duration might affect the model's adaptation time, referencing Smirnakis et al. Nature 1997. This is a justified claim because it cites an external reference, which adds credibility. The reasoning is logical, connecting the stimulus duration to adaptation time based on prior research. So, this is **Fully Verifiable** (5).\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is asking for clarification on a specific technical aspect of the model training and its implications. It's clear and directly addresses a potential concern the authors might have. It provides a specific question that could guide their investigation, making it helpful.

It seems like it's asking a question, which might be a way to prompt the author to think about the implications. But is it explicit? Or is it more of a suggestion? I think it's more of a question, so maybe it's implicit. If it's implicit, then the author would have to infer what to do next. So, it's not as actionable as it could be. Maybe it's a 3 on actionability because it's explicit but vague.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is asking about the CAD model and BRDF maps. It mentions \"spatially-varying (SV) BRDF maps,\" which is specific. So, the author can pinpoint exactly where the issue is.

Yes, because it's directly pointing out a problem with the comparisons. But is it vague? The reviewer is suggesting that the comparisons aren't using the same amount of data, but they don't specify how this affects the results or what changes should be made. So, while the action is clear, the details are missing. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully because the authors still need to figure out what exactly to do next.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions specific comparisons, like H->N vs H->N+B and H->N->H vs H->N+B->H. They're pointing out exact sections in the paper (like the tables) and specific issues with data usage. This means the reviewer has fully grounded the comment because they're referring to specific parts of the paper. Additionally, they're being specific about what's wrong, so this is highly specific. \n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that the comparisons aren't using the same amount of data, which could affect the validity.

I'd give this a 2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains claims like \"Adding it at the very end is a bit counterintuitive\" and \"no reference to Laplacian eigenmaps.\" These are claims that need justification. The first part is a general statement, but the second part about missing citations could be supported by common knowledge that references are important. However, it's not fully justified with specific examples or external references.

So, it's not explicit, and the action is unclear. That would be a 2: Borderline Actionable.\n\nNext, **grounding_specificity**. The review mentions the experimental section but doesn't specify which part of the section is weak or what needs to be improved. It's too general, so the grounding is weak. That's a 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **verifiability**, the review is making a judgment that the experimental section is weak and suggests more experiments. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why more experiments are needed. It's just a statement without support, so it's unverifiable. That's a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a weakness and suggesting more experiments, which is helpful. It gives a clear idea for improvement without being vague. So, it's a 4: Mostly Helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding Specificity: 3\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"3\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

The review suggests the manuscript could benefit from more comparisons with various models and fine-tuning techniques beyond LoRA and SPP. It's an explicit statement, so that's good. But it's vague because it doesn't specify which models or techniques to use or how to implement these comparisons. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to do next. I think this falls under borderline actionable because it's explicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions models and techniques but doesn't specify which ones or where to find them. It's too vague, so the authors can't pinpoint exactly what part of the paper needs improvement. This means the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the referenced part. The specificity about the models isn't clear either, so it's not fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it suggests an improvement area. It's supported by the reviewer's knowledge of various techniques, which is common knowledge. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's based on established practices, but it doesn't provide specific references or examples, which could make it more robust.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out a clear area for improvement but doesn't provide specific suggestions or examples. It's vague, so while it's helpful, it's not the most helpful because it lacks depth and specific guidance.

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points suggest specific changes like fixing typos and improving grammar. These are explicit actions, so the reviewer is directly telling the authors what to do. Additionally, the changes are concrete, like fixing \"Despite of being compact\u201d to \u201cDespite being compact\u201d, which clearly tells the authors exactly what to correct. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: Each correction targets a specific part of the paper. For example, line 2 refers to a specific typo, line 56 to another, and so on. The reviewer is accurately pinpointing the sections, which means the grounding is full. Each change is specific, so the specificity is also high.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review points are not making any claims beyond suggesting improvements. They're just pointing out issues without needing external references or logical reasoning. So, this falls under \"X\" because there are no claims, just descriptive feedback.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions for fixes, which are directly helpful to the authors. Each change is specific and actionable, so the feedback is meaningful and constructive.

W4 \u2013 Mistakes in Eqs.\" It's asking for clarification on a specific part of the equations. The reviewer is pointing out that there's ambiguity in the text and that the equations have mistakes. So, the action here is to clarify the equations. It's explicit because it directly points out the issue. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify exactly what's wrong or how to fix it. They just mention that there are mistakes. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to figure out what's wrong. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is referring to the equations by their section, W4, which is specific. They're also pointing out that there are mistakes, which is clear. So, the grounding is strong because they're accurately pointing to the specific part of the paper. The specificity is also good because they're clearly indicating the issue in that part.

It also asks about downstream applications and handling uncertainty. I think this is more of a question than an actionable suggestion. The authors aren't given clear steps to improve their work; instead, they're asked to consider applications and handle uncertainty, which is vague. So, this isn't very actionable.

However, it's vague about how to implement this, like whether they should add noise or how much. Also, it mentions minor comments but doesn't specify what needs fixing. So, it's explicit in the action but lacks detail, making it borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions ImageNet with 1000 classes, which is specific. It also refers to non-tail classes, adding more specificity. The suggestion is clear about the experiment, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting an experiment, which is verifiable through existing knowledge.

The review says the evaluation isn't comprehensive and lacks transparency about the experiment setup, mentioning missing details like the number of in-content examples and varying their numbers. It also points out reliance on a single dataset. \n\nFor Actionability, it's about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. The review mentions specific issues but doesn't tell the authors exactly how to fix them. It's vague on the changes needed, like not specifying how to vary the number of examples or what dataset to use. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implicit suggestion, which is good but not enough. It's also not concrete because it doesn't outline the steps. So, I think this is Borderline Actionable because it does suggest an action but doesn't detail how to implement it.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions specific issues like missing details in experiments and reliance on a single dataset. It clearly identifies the parts of the paper being addressed, like the experiment setup and dataset. So, it's fully grounded because it points to specific sections. It's also specific because it details what's missing, which helps the authors know exactly where to focus. So, this should be Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nVerifiability. The review contains claims about the evaluation lacking comprehensiveness and transparency. It supports these claims by mentioning missing details and reliance on a single dataset.
