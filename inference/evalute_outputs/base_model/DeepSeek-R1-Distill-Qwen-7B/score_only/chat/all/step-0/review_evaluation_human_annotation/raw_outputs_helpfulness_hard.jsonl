It suggests this might introduce noise. The comment is explicit about the issue and provides a clear explanation of why it's a problem. It also gives a concrete example of how this could introduce noise. So, this is both explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review clearly mentions the specific part of the paper being discussed, which is the description of HIERENC. It also explains what the issue is, so the grounding is explicit and specific. Therefore, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that averaging all possible instantiations introduces noise. It provides a logical explanation and an example, which supports the claim. This makes the claim thoroughly justified, so it's fully verifiable. I'll give this a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is very helpful. It points out a clear issue, explains why it's a problem, and provides a concrete example.

The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue with the wording, so that's explicit. However, the suggestion to correct it is vague\u2014how exactly should it be corrected? The reviewer doesn't provide specific steps or details, so it's not very actionable. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because the action is clear but the implementation is vague.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to a specific part of the paper, mentioning the cognitive bias in NLP research. It's clear which part is being addressed\u2014the discussion of \"on par or better.\" So the grounding is full because it accurately points to the section.

However, the justification is vague and doesn't provide specific references or examples. It's more of a suggestion without solid backing, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer provides feedback that the results are fine except for the wording issue. This is helpful because it points out an improvement area.

It suggests using data augmentation beyond the low-resource setting and points out that sentence classification is easier. It also mentions the method's potential for more NLP tasks but doesn't show them. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does suggest using data augmentation in other settings, which is an action. However, they don't specify exactly how to implement this, like which parts of the paper to modify or which data augmentation techniques to use.

The reviewer talks about the low-resource setting, which is specific, but also mentions that it's not the only case. They also suggest the method could be used in more tasks but don't pin it down. So, the grounding is somewhat clear about the low-resource part but not fully specific about other applications. It's not weak grounding because they do identify the area, but it's not fully specific either. So, this would be **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because they do address the low-resource part but don't specify other tasks.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer makes claims about the experiments being too limited, suggests using data augmentation elsewhere, and mentions the method's potential for more tasks. Each of these claims needs justification. They don't provide references or logical reasoning to back up these suggestions, so it's unclear if these are well-supported.

It mentions that many systems build knowledge graphs and generate summaries, but as the number of nodes increases, it becomes harder to distinguish concepts, making general summaries more readable. The comment is pointing out a problem but doesn't specify what needs to be done. It's more of an observation than an explicit action. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors aren't told exactly how to adjust their approach.

So, this gets a 5 here as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that modular architectures aren't discussed in the introduction.

They do explicitly state which part of the paper they're referring to, which is the related work section. So, the grounding is strong because they're pointing to a specific section.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says, \"I don't think the study about different subdomain sizes is an 'ablation' study since they aren't removing a component of the method.\" The reviewer is suggesting that the study isn't an ablation study because they didn't remove any part of the method. This is an explicit statement, so it's clear what the reviewer is pointing out. Additionally, the reviewer provides a concrete reason why it's not an ablation study by stating that they didn't remove any component. So, this is both explicit and concrete. Therefore, it should be highly actionable because the author can directly apply this feedback to their work.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions \"the study about different subdomain sizes\" and specifies that it's not an ablation study. They also explain why by saying they didn't remove any component. This clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being discussed and explains the issue. So, the grounding is full because they accurately pinpoint the section and provide a clear reason. Therefore, this review is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the study isn't an ablation study. They support this by stating that they didn't remove any component of the method. This explanation is logical and provides sufficient justification. There's no need for external references here because the reasoning is straightforward and based on the information given. So, this claim is thoroughly supported, making it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is clear and directly addresses a potential misunderstanding about the study's nature. They explain why it's not an ablation study, which is helpful for the author to understand the context better. While it might not cover every possible aspect, it provides significant value by clarifying the study's purpose. Therefore, it's highly helpful as it gives the author specific feedback that can improve their work.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores highly. The review is explicit and concrete, fully grounded and specific, fully verifiable, and highly helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It's not just asking for a general explanation but is seeking detailed information. The reviewer is pointing out that the current explanation is vague and lacks concrete details. They want to know the number of attention modules, their placement, and whether they're after each block or stage. This is an explicit action because the reviewer is directly asking for specific information. However, the action isn't very detailed. It's clear that the authors need to provide more specifics, but the reviewer isn't giving any guidance on how to do that. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks the specifics on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer is asking about the ResNet-20 architecture, specifically where the attention modules are placed. They mention the backbone architecture, which is a specific part of the paper. So, the grounding is pretty solid because they're referring to a specific section of the paper. The specificity is about the placement details, which the reviewer is asking for. They want to know after each block or stage, which is a specific question. Therefore, this is \"Fully Grounded and Specific\" because the part being addressed is clearly identified, and the specifics are well-defined.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that the attention module's placement and number should be clarified. This is a subjective opinion or judgment. To verify this claim, the reviewer would need to provide evidence or reasoning. However, in the given review point, there's no supporting evidence or references. The reviewer is pointing out an issue but isn't providing any justification or examples. So, this claim is not well-supported. It's a claim without sufficient justification, making it \"Unverifiable.\"\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is asking for specific details about the attention module's placement and number.

The review mentions 'AR' in Table 5, which is specific. It clearly identifies the part of the paper (Table 5) and what's wrong (confusion due to lack of definition). So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the section. The specificity is also good because it explains why 'AR' is problematic. So, this should be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the review states that 'AR' stands for domain adaptation tasks and algorithms. This is a claim because it's making a judgment about the abbreviations. The justification is clear and provides specific references, so it's fully verifiable. Therefore, the verifiability score is 5: Fully Verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out the issue and provides a clear explanation. It suggests that the authors should define the abbreviations to avoid confusion. This is actionable and constructive. It helps the authors improve their work by guiding them on what to do. So, this is highly helpful, giving it a 5: Highly Helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability 3, grounding_specificity 5, verifiability 5, and helpfulness 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

The comment is pointing out a specific part of the paper, which is line 44, so the grounding is clear. It's not just a general statement; it's directly addressing a specific line. The specificity is about explaining why the rationale selector needs to be perfect. It's not just stating a problem but explaining the implication of it being perfect.

It's a bit vague, so I'd say it's weakly grounded. Maybe a 2?\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes claims about over-smoothing and the impact of positive samples. However, it doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's just stating opinions without backing, so it's not very verifiable. Maybe a 2 here.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review raises valid concerns and suggests additional experiments, which is helpful. It does provide some direction, even if it's not fully detailed.

It's making a direct comparison and providing a suggestion. The action is explicit\u2014comparing two architectures and recommending more discussion. The suggestion is clear, so this should be highly actionable. So, I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions fast SMP and SMP, which are specific terms, but it's not pointing to a particular part of the paper. It's more of a general question about architectures. The grounding is weak because it's not clearly referencing a specific section or figure. So, this should be a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making a claim that fast SMP is less expressive. However, it doesn't provide any justification or evidence for this claim. It's just a statement without supporting references or reasoning.

It's an explicit action because it directly tells the authors to change their evaluation approach. The action is clear, so it's actionable. It also provides concrete details on what to do, which makes it highly actionable. So, I'd rate this as 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment specifies the evaluation across different splits, which is a specific part of the paper. It's well grounded because it clearly mentions the data splits. The specificity is good as it tells the authors exactly where to focus.

It also asks about redundancy and interference in the discretization process. The action here is pointing out ambiguity and unclear explanations. It's explicit because it directly mentions Figure 2 and the lack of clarity. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to fix it or what changes to make. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 2 by name, which is specific. It also mentions the discretization process, which is a unique part of the paper. The grounding is strong because it clearly points to the figure and the specific process. The specificity is good because it's not just pointing out a problem but also asking about a particular method.

However, Matern kernels, which are more commonly used, have spectra that decay polynomially, so the authors' results might be restrictive. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the comment is pointing out a limitation, but it's more of an observation rather than a direct action. The authors might need to consider alternative kernels or adjust their analysis. So, it's not giving a clear step-by-step action but rather points out a potential area for improvement. I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it suggests a direction for the authors to explore, but it's not explicit.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about Matern kernels and their polynomial decay. It specifically mentions that these kernels are not included because their spectrum decays polynomially. This clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed, so the grounding is strong. It also specifies what's missing, which adds specificity. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the authors' assumption might be restrictive. It's suggesting that considering Matern kernels could be beneficial. The justification here is that Matern kernels are commonly used and have different spectral properties. This is supported by common knowledge about kernel types, so the claim is well-justified.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the experimental comparison is unfair because the proposed method was pre-trained before fine-tuning, and it's unclear if the compared methods were initialized with the same pre-trained model. It also points out that without SSL, the proposed method performs worse than most compared methods. \n\nIs this an explicit action? The reviewer is making a claim about the fairness of the comparison and suggesting a specific issue. They're also providing some reasoning, like the pre-training step. So, it's explicit because they're directly pointing out the issue. Now, is it concrete? They do give some details, like the pre-training and the performance comparison. So, I think this is **4: Mostly Actionable** because while the action is inferred, the details are provided.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about the experimental comparison being unfair. They mention the pre-training step and the performance without SSL. They also refer to Table 1, which suggests they can accurately pinpoint where the issue lies. So, they have full grounding because they're referring to a specific part of the paper (the comparison section and Table 1). They also clearly specify what needs to be addressed, which is the fairness and the pre-training issue. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the comparison is unfair and suggests that the pre-trained models might not be on the same scale. They provide some reasoning about the pre-training step and the performance metrics. However, they don't cite external references or specific literature to back this up. The reasoning is logical but lacks concrete external support. So, this is **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but it's not fully robust.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue in the comparison and suggesting improvements. They provide some reasoning about the pre-training and the performance without SSL. However, the suggestion is somewhat vague in terms of how to fix it. They don't specify exact changes or provide references for further reading. So, it's helpful but not the most detailed.

Therefore, it's borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions specific terms like \"Confidence Diversity (CD)\" and references line numbers. It does point to specific areas in the paper, so that's good grounding. It also asks about entropy, which is a specific measure, so it's clear what's being discussed. That makes it well-grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making claims about what CD captures beyond predictive uncertainty and why entropy isn't suitable. It references line 113, which presumably explains this, so the claim is supported by existing information.

It's an explicit action because it directly recommends a different statistical test. Then, it provides concrete details about why a paired test is better, explaining that the samples are dependent. So, this is both explicit and concrete, making it highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which is a specific statistical test. It clearly states why this test is appropriate, linking it to the paired nature of the data.

Well, it's suggesting that these models should be included, but it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to do that. So, it's not explicit because it's just a suggestion without clear steps. It's more of an implicit action, which means the authors would have to infer how to improve their work by adding these models. Since it's implicit, it's not highly actionable. Maybe it's a 3 or 4 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions specific models, so it's definitely grounded because it's pointing to particular models. But does it specify what's wrong with the current approach? It just says they aren't compared, which is somewhat specific. So, I think it's weakly grounded and somewhat specific, maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim that other models aren't compared. Is this claim supported?

It also suggests that for some graphs, the existing bound might be better. However, it doesn't provide explicit actions or concrete steps on how to improve the bounds. It seems more like a commentary on the existing work rather than a direct instruction on what to do. So, this isn't very actionable.

It mentions the independence number and adaptive adversary but doesn't clearly identify which section or figure in the paper is affected. This makes it weakly grounded because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. So, I'd give this a 3 since it's not fully grounded but there's some indication of the problem.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that the current bound uses the independence number and suggests that another bound might be better. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. The claim is made without justification, so it's not verifiable. This would score a 1 because there's no backing to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out some issues but doesn't offer concrete solutions or detailed suggestions.

So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint exactly where the issue lies. It's not fully grounded since it doesn't clearly identify the referenced part.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests that finetuning depends on external factors like the environment or OPE methods. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references. It's making a judgment that finetuning is needed but doesn't back it up with logical reasoning or external sources. So, this is \"Unverifiable\" because there's no justification or evidence provided to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out that hyperparameters need finetuning but doesn't offer any specific suggestions or methods on how to do that. It's vague and doesn't provide actionable steps. Without clear guidance, the authors won't know how to proceed, so it's not very helpful. It's more of a warning without actionable advice, so it's \"Not Helpful at All.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}

It also asks a question about the convergence of networks in a baseline. The explicitness here is clear because it directly points out the errors and asks a question. The specificity is good because it's about specific parts of the text. So, this is highly actionable because the reviewer is giving precise instructions and a clear question to address the issues.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions specific lines and parts of the text, which means it accurately identifies where the problems are. It doesn't just say \"line 108\" but also explains what the issue is, which shows a good understanding. The specificity is high because it's not just pointing out a problem but also asking about a specific aspect of the methodology.\n\nFor verifiability, the review contains a claim by pointing out the typo and extra period, which are verifiable issues. The justification is clear and direct, so it's fully verifiable. There's no need for external references or logical reasoning beyond pointing out the errors, which makes it robust.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is very helpful because it directly addresses two issues and asks a clear question about the methodology. It provides actionable feedback without being vague or overly lengthy.

It also states that this is a new approach. The explicit action is pointing out the dependence and suggesting a new framework, which is clear. However, the suggestions are quite vague on how to implement the framework or what specific changes are needed. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this falls under **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to Table 4 for model accuracy sensitivity and mentions a new federated learning approach. It accurately points out the specific part (Table 4) and clearly explains the issue with pre-trained models.

It's not giving a direct action or suggestion. It's more of an observation rather than a directive. So, it's not actionable because the author isn't told what to do; they're just informed that they don't understand it. Therefore, this is borderline actionable because it hints at a problem but doesn't specify how to fix it.\n\n**Grounding Specificity:** The comment refers to Figure 5 but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's addressing. It's a general statement about the figure, so the grounding is weak. The author isn't told exactly where the issue is, just that they don't understand it. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\n**Verifiability:** The comment is a judgment about the author's understanding, which is a claim.

That makes it somewhat actionable because it points out a problem, but it's vague on the solution.

It doesn't explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, just the approach. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing an exact section or issue. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be a 2.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that classical bounds aren't realistic without Bayesian methods. It supports this with knowledge of Bayesian-PAC bounds, which is a good justification. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully.

It suggests considering the extra complexity and cost. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the review does suggest considering the extra models, which is a clear action. But is it explicit or implicit? It seems explicit because it tells the authors to think about the additional complexity. Is it concrete? Yes, it tells them exactly what to consider. So this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review talks about the comparison being unfair because it requires two models. It mentions VAE/GAN + CL. This is specific because it names the models and the extra step. So the grounding is fully grounded, and it's specific about what needs to be considered. That would be a 5 here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the comparison is unfair and suggests considering the extra models. The claim is supported by stating that the extra models are required, which is a logical reasoning. It references specific models, so it's verifiable. Therefore, this should be a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear feedback about the unfair comparison and the need to consider extra models.

It suggests that the authors should consider this limitation. This is explicit, so it's actionable. The action is clear: authors should be aware of the limitation. However, it doesn't specify how to address it, so it's not fully concrete.

So yes, it gives clear actions the authors should take, like investigating the pretraining approach and considering the model's generality. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to QM9 and specific tasks, which is pretty specific. It mentions the homo-lumo gap and the poor performance on most tasks except a few. The authors can pinpoint where the problem lies, so this is fully grounded and specific. \n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides examples (QM9 results) and explains the contradiction. It uses logical reasoning to connect the pretraining issue with the model's general-purpose claim. It's supported by external references (QM9 dataset) and logical connections, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review clearly identifies a potential issue and provides actionable insights.

I think this is explicit because it directly states the issue. But does it give clear instructions on what to do? The reviewer doesn't suggest any changes or improvements, just points out the issues. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps.

I guess you want to write that the sum of the 'optimistic' hoped for rewards is close to the expected actual rewards.\" It seems like it's pointing out that the term \"is sufficient\" is vague and suggests the reviewer wants a more precise explanation. Is this an explicit action? The reviewer is asking for clarification, which is a direct action. But is it concrete? The reviewer isn't giving specific steps or how to improve it, just asking for more detail. So I think this is borderline actionable because the action is implicit.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions L240 and L428, which are line numbers, so that's explicit grounding. It also explains what they're referring to, which is the use of \"is sufficient.\" The specificity is okay because it explains the context, but it's not super detailed. So I'd say it's weakly grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it's suggesting that \"is sufficient\" needs more detail. The justification is that the reviewer wants a more precise explanation. This is logical reasoning and common knowledge, so it's fairly verifiable. Maybe a 4 because it's mostly supported but could be clearer.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking for clarification, which is helpful but vague.

It also points out that this comes at the cost of less information compared to DAGs. The reviewer suggests that the reviewer should explain how much information of a DAG is encoded in its ancestral graph. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is asking the author to explain something, which is an explicit action. But is it concrete? The reviewer isn't giving specific steps or how to apply this. So, it's explicit but vague.

But they don't clearly specify which part of the paper they're addressing. They're using general terms without pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint the exact area. The specificity about the information loss isn't detailed either. So, this would be a 2 for grounding specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that reducing the search space affects the information content.

The review doesn't specify how to add it, like whether to use certain metrics or how to present the data. So it's explicit but not concrete. That would make it **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out a specific part of the paper\u2014the experiments section\u2014where GFLOPs are compared. It's clearly mentioning the section, so that's full grounding. Then, it suggests adding a speed analysis, which is specific about what needs to be addressed. So that's **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that adding speed analysis would be beneficial. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references, just a suggestion. So it's unverifiable. That would be **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a clear improvement area and suggests a specific change. It's helpful because it guides the authors to add more comprehensive analysis. It's not the most detailed, but it's still useful.

It also lists specific problems but doesn't guide how to fix them. So, this is more of a suggestion without concrete steps.

It doesn't just say \"the plots are bad\" but points out exact problems. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the parts of the paper being discussed. The specificity is also high because it details what's wrong without bringing up external work.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the plots are poor and suggests improvements.

The comment is pointing out a nuance in the corollary. It's explicit about the point, so that's good. But does it give clear instructions on what to do next? The reviewer is explaining a relationship but isn't suggesting a change. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete steps. I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but not giving actionable advice.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions Corollar 10 and talks about the expected 0-1 loss and convex surrogate. It's pretty specific about the part of the paper being discussed, so the grounding is strong. The comment is clear about which part it's addressing, so I'd rate this as **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the corollary doesn't imply uncertainty sampling isn't minimizing the convex surrogate. It's supported by the statement of the corollary, so the reasoning is logical and clear. There's no need for external references here, just a logical argument. So, this should be **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific point in the corollary and explaining its implications.

So, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions adding specific details about the division method, which clearly identifies the part of the paper being addressed. It's grounded because it refers to a specific aspect of the methodology. It's also specific because it tells the authors exactly what to add, not just a general suggestion.

Well, it's a subjective judgment. Without evidence or references, it's hard to verify. So it's borderline verifiable because it's a claim but lacks justification.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out a claim but doesn't provide specific feedback or suggestions. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve. So it's barely helpful because it identifies an issue but doesn't offer actionable steps.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that at least one NCE-based method should be included and references a specific paper. It doesn't provide explicit instructions on what changes to make or how to implement the suggestion. So, it's not fully actionable. It's more of a suggestion without concrete steps, which would make it borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to NCE-based methods and mentions a specific paper. However, it doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper is being addressed or why the method is relevant. It's a bit vague in pinpointing the exact section or figure, so it's weakly grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review cites a specific paper but doesn't provide any justification or reasoning for why NCE-based methods are relevant or how they apply to the current work. There's no supporting evidence or logical reasoning, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment suggests including NCE-based methods and references another paper, but it doesn't explain why this is beneficial or how it helps the authors improve their draft. It lacks clarity and depth, making it not very helpful.\n\nSo, based on these evaluations, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 2 (Weakly Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: 1 (Unverifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 2 (Barely Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

It points out that existing methods use smaller datasets, like GEM with 20M unlabeled data. The reviewer is suggesting that the scale impacts accuracy, implying that the proposed method's superiority is due to the new large dataset. \n\nIs this explicit? The reviewer is making a claim that the dataset size affects accuracy, which is an explicit action. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't specify how the larger dataset helps or how the results were compared. It's a bit vague because they don't provide details on the comparison process or the extent to which the dataset size influenced the results. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what steps to take next.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about the newly collected 209M dataset and existing methods using smaller ones, like GEM's 20M. This clearly references specific parts of the paper\u2014specific datasets used. They also mention the impact of dataset scale on accuracy, which is a general point but still grounds the comment in specific elements of the paper. So, this is fully grounded because they're pointing out specific datasets and their characteristics.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that dataset size affects accuracy. They don't provide any supporting evidence or references. They just state that larger datasets might influence the results. Without backing this up with logical reasoning or external references, it's hard to verify. So, this is unverifiable because there's no justification or examples given to support the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with the comparison but doesn't offer a constructive suggestion. They're critiquing the methodology but aren't providing a clear alternative or how to address the unfair comparison. This makes the comment somewhat helpful but not very actionable or detailed. It's more of a critique without a solution, so it's somewhat helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable) because the action is implied but vague.\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific) as they reference specific datasets and the issue.\n- Verifiability: 1 (Unverifiable) because there's no support for the claim.\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful) as it's a critique but lacks actionable suggestions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

The reviewer mentions the DNN-related paragraph but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. They just say it's not central. So the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly which section is the issue. They mention it's in the Introduction but don't give a specific reference like a subsection or figure. So this would be 2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific because they can't identify the exact part and don't specify what needs fixing.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer makes a claim that the DNN introduction is not central. They back this up by stating the paper's focus is on drift detection. This is a clear claim, and the reasoning is logical. They reference the paper's core focus, which is a well-known concept, so it's verifiable. Therefore, this should be 5: Fully Verifiable because the claim is supported by clear reasoning and references.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer points out that the Introduction is not central and provides little info. They suggest the paragraph is not valuable.

The reviewer is suggesting an addition, so it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is giving a specific instruction to mention the sampled policy, so they're not just saying \"improve\" but specifying what to add. That makes it concrete.

It's unclear whether it's talking about the methodology section or the results. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the exact area. The specificity is also low since it doesn't clearly explain what's wrong with the comparison.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the motivation is unclear and that the comparison is unfair. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. There's no logical reasoning or external sources to support these claims. So, it's **Unverifiable** because there's no evidence to back up the points made.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review does identify some issues but lacks depth. It mentions the need for explaining the adversarial network's purpose and the unfair comparison but doesn't offer solutions or how to address these points. This makes it somewhat helpful but not fully so.

The comment is stating a fact about adversarial loss and perturbed data without suggesting any specific changes. It doesn't provide actionable steps or clarify what needs to be done.

It seems like it's pointing out a problem but doesn't tell the authors what to do. So it's not explicit. Is it implicit? Well, it's suggesting that visualization is needed, but it's vague on how to add it. So it's implicit but vague. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it implies an action but doesn't specify how to implement it.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment mentions \"intermediate processes and comparisons.\" It doesn't specify which part of the paper or which figures/tables. So the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't reference specific sections. It's also not specific about what needs fixing. So this is weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nVerifiability. The comment is a claim because it's suggesting that there's a lack of visualization. Now, is this claim supported? It's a general statement about the paper, so it doesn't reference external literature or provide examples. It's more of an opinion without justification. So it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. It's unverifiable.\n\nHelpfulness. The comment points out a problem but doesn't suggest solutions. It's vague and doesn't help the authors improve their work beyond identifying the issue. So it's not helpful at all because it doesn't provide actionable feedback.

The authors might not know exactly how to adjust their methods or where to focus their efforts. So, it's explicit in pointing out an issue but lacks specific guidance on how to address it.

Is this explicit or implicit? Well, it's directly asking for the feature extractor, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer is asking for the name or type of the feature extractor, which is specific enough. So, this should be highly actionable because the author can look it up or provide the information.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is pointing out a specific part of the paper, line 201, so the grounding is clear. It's not making a general comment but specifically referencing a line. Therefore, the grounding is strong. Also, it's specific because it's about the feature extractor, which is a detail in that line.

It's clear which part of the paper it's referring to, so the grounding is strong. The comment also explains why this matters, which adds specificity. I think this is a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific because it accurately points to the method and explains its importance.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that the method might be different from traditional active learning. It doesn't provide evidence or references to back this up. Without justification, it's hard for the authors to verify if their method is indeed different. So this is 1: Unverifiable because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review raises a valid concern about potential misinterpretation. It provides some insight but lacks depth. The authors might not know how to verify their method or what specific changes to make. So it's somewhat helpful but not fully. I'd rate this a 3: Somewhat Helpful because it does inform the authors of a potential issue but doesn't offer detailed guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 3\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

I think this is an explicit action because it directly points out the issue with the method. But is it concrete?

So, I think it's explicit but not very detailed on how to do that. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It's a general statement about the task being Argument Mining. So, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint where the issue is. Maybe a 1 or 2.\n\nVerifiability. The review is making a claim that the task is Argument Mining, but it's not supported by any evidence or references. It's just a statement. So, it's a normal statement without verifiability. Maybe a 6 or X, but since X is for no claim, and this is a claim, perhaps it's unverifiable. So, 1.\n\nHelpfulness. The review is pointing out a problem and suggesting improvement, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable in the sense that it's pointing out the need for clarification. It's not vague, so it's helpful. Maybe a 4 or 5. Since it's clear and suggests improvement, I'll go with 4.\n\nWait, but for grounding_specificity, it's not grounded at all because it doesn't specify where the issue is. So, 1. For actionability, it's explicit but not concrete on how to implement the change, so maybe 3. Verifiability is unverifiable because it's a claim without support, so 1. Helpfulness is 4 because it's clear and actionable but not the most detailed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It also suggests providing evidence for sparsity and comparing with existing methods. The comment is explicit about the need for clarification and comparison, so that's an explicit action. It also gives concrete advice on what to do, like showing advantages. So, this seems highly actionable because it tells the authors exactly what to do and how.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to the residual term by name, which is specific. It also mentions comparing with existing methods, which is a clear instruction on what to do. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the part of the paper and what needs to be addressed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment contains a claim that the residual term's sparsity needs clarification and comparison. It provides some justification by suggesting evidence and advantages, which are logical and common-sense reasons. It doesn't cite external references, but the reasoning is solid. So, it's somewhat verifiable but could be better by including examples or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review point is clear, suggests specific improvements, and provides actionable steps. It helps the authors by guiding them on what to do and why. While it could be more detailed, it's definitely helpful and gives meaningful feedback.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect seems to be at least a 4, but maybe the grounding could be 5 because it's fully grounded and specific.

It also asks if there are challenges for language tasks. The suggestions are explicit, so that's good. But are the actions clear? The reviewer is pointing out specific models and datasets, so the authors know what to change. The verbiage is direct, so I think this is **Highly Actionable** because it's explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions specific models and datasets, so they're clearly pointing out parts of the paper. The mention of CIFAR100, ResNet variants, and ViT sizes shows they're pinning down specific sections. The specificity is high because they're not just saying the models are toy-like but providing exact examples. So this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the models/datasets are toy-like. They support this by suggesting alternatives like CIFAR100 and specific network architectures. These are well-known benchmarks, so the justification is solid. They also ask about challenges in language tasks, which is a valid point. The evidence is clear and logical, so this is **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

There's no claim here, just a request for information. So, it's an \"X\" with no claim, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking for information on extraction methods but doesn't provide any guidance on how this affects the experiment or what improvements can be made. It's a question without actionable suggestions. So, it's barely helpful because it does identify an area for improvement but lacks clarity and direction. That would be a 2.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 2\n- Grounding Specificity: 2\n- Verifiability: 1\n- Helpfulness: 2\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"2\"\n}\n```"}

The comment is giving a clear action: either move the content or remove it. It's explicit about what needs to be done. Now, is it concrete? Yes, it tells the authors exactly where to move it or remove it. So, it's not just a suggestion but a specific action. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions L107-114 but doesn't specify exactly which part of the paper that is. It just says \"this part\" or \"that section.\" So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. They have to make an educated guess, which isn't fully grounded. So, this is weakly grounded and not specific, which would be a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that the content is speculative or opinionated. It doesn't provide any evidence or references to back this claim. It's just a statement of opinion without justification. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is pointing out an issue and giving a suggestion, which is helpful. It's clear and actionable, so the authors can understand what needs to be done. It's somewhat helpful because it's not too vague, but it could be more detailed.

The motivation behind this is unclear to me.\" The comment is asking for clarification on why these specific distributions were chosen. It's not giving a direct action or suggestion, so it's not explicit. It's more of a question, which might be considered implicit. Since the reviewer is asking a question but not providing a clear solution or action, it's not very actionable. So, I'd rate this as 2: Borderline Actionable because it does hint at a need for explanation but doesn't specify how to proceed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment is asking about the motivation for using these distributions. It doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to, so the grounding is weak. The reviewer isn't pointing to a specific section or figure, just asking in general. Therefore, it's not fully grounded because it's too vague.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is asking a question without providing any justification or references. It's purely speculative, so there's no supporting evidence. This means it's unverifiable, scoring it as 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking for clarification, which is helpful in itself because it shows they want to understand better.

It says the authors only want a unified form without considering the task differences. I think this is explicit because it directly states the issue. But is it concrete? It suggests that the authors didn't think about the task differences, which gives a clear action: authors should consider the distinction between classification and regression when using focal loss.
