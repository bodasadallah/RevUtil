(2020) and didn't use domain adaptation methods from Section 8. It also suggests improvements in line 277. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer points out specific areas where comparisons should have been made, which is explicit. However, the suggestion in line 277 is a bit vague\u2014it just says \"may be attributed\" without clear guidance on how to apply this. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what to do next. Maybe they need more specific instructions on how to incorporate those comparisons or methods.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions specific references like Campos et al. (2020) and Section 8. That's pretty specific because they're naming exact sections and citing works. So, the grounding is strong here. The comment clearly identifies the parts of the paper that should be addressed, which is good for the authors to know exactly where to focus their improvements.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer's claims are that the author didn't compare enough and should have cited specific methods. The justification provided is that other works cited in Section 8 exist. This is somewhat verifiable because they reference other works, but it's not very detailed. The reviewer doesn't provide a lot of examples or logical reasoning beyond citing other sections, so it's somewhat verifiable but not fully robust.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out specific areas for improvement and mentions two other studies, which is helpful. However, the suggestion in line 277 is vague. The authors might not know exactly how to proceed with that part. So, while it's somewhat helpful, it's not the most detailed or clear feedback. It could be improved by providing more specific instructions.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable because it points out specific areas, but the action isn't fully clear.

However, it doesn't provide specific instructions on how to implement these changes. For example, it doesn't say whether to use mean, max, or another pooling method. So, while it's explicit about the issues, the action on how to fix them is vague. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review points to specific sections, line 397 and equation (7). It mentions the pooling method and the equation, which are specific parts of the paper. However, it doesn't explain why these are problematic or how they affect the model. Without context, the authors might not understand the issues. So, it's grounded in the paper's sections but lacks specificity in explaining the problems. I think this is a 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim about the pooling method and the equation needing clarification. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or references.

It's explicit because it's telling the authors to do something. But is it concrete? The review doesn't specify how to show the evidence, like which experiments to run or how to measure performance. So it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly what steps to take. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the Column Subset Selection problem and the third contribution, but it doesn't specify exactly where in the paper this should be addressed. It's a bit vague. The authors might not know which part of the paper to focus on, so the grounding isn't fully specific. It's more of a general suggestion without pinpointing the exact issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the algorithm works better, which is a subjective opinion.

It also disagrees with the authors' claim that CNNs and ViTs benefit similarly. The reviewer points out specific cases where DeiT-B doesn't outperform DeiT-T and S on certain datasets, and suggests that CNNs show more consistent improvements except on ISIC2019. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is suggesting more analysis, which is a clear action. However, they don't specify exactly what kind of analysis or how to implement it. They mention looking into performance trends but don't provide concrete steps, like rerunning experiments or suggesting specific metrics. So, it's explicit that more analysis is needed, but it's vague on the exact actions.

The reviewer refers to Figure 3 and specific datasets like APTOS2019, ISIC2019, and CheXpert. They also mention the impact of 0.1% model capacity on performance. This seems pretty specific because they're pointing out exact parts of the paper and even suggesting the minimal impact of a small increase in capacity. So, the grounding is strong because they're accurately pointing to specific sections and providing clear details about what's missing.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that DeiT-B doesn't outperform DeiT-T and S on certain datasets. They back this up by stating specific results and suggesting that the improvement from CNNs is more consistent. They also reference external literature by mentioning that 0.1% won't be significant, which implies they're using common knowledge about model capacity impacts. So, this claim is well-supported with logical reasoning and references, making it **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer provides a clear disagreement with the authors' claim, points out specific data from Figure 3, and suggests that CNNs are more reliable.

The comment suggests that the authors' approach is redundant. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a direct action for the authors. They're implying that using the coarse method is redundant, but they're not instructing the authors on what to do next. So, it's more implicit. \n\nIs it concrete or vague?

The review says that the authors take the first subword token as the verb embedding and mentions averaging over subword representations, citing a footnote. Is this explicit? Yes, it tells them exactly what to do. Is it concrete? They specify how to get the verb embedding and mention a common practice with a reference. So, this should be highly actionable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The comment refers to a specific part of the paper by mentioning the footnote, which is a specific element. It also provides a reference, so the authors can pinpoint where the footnote is. This is fully grounded and specific, so a 5 here.\n\nVerifiability. The comment includes a claim that it's common to average subword representations, supported by a citation. The justification is logical and provides a reference, so it's fully verifiable. That's a 5.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review points out a specific method and provides a reference, which is helpful for the authors to understand and improve their work.

It's explicit about the actions taken, like checking architectural mismatches and cross-domain imitation. But does it give concrete details on how to improve? It just states what was done, not how to fix it. So, it's explicit but lacks specifics on implementation. That would be a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"various settings\" and mentions specific scenarios like architectural mismatch and cross-domain. It doesn't name exact sections or unique aspects, so it's not fully grounded. It's weakly grounded because it can make an educated guess but not precisely point to the parts. So, 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review talks about experiments but doesn't provide any justification or references.

Is it 100 sampled strategies?\" The reviewer is asking a question about what 100 steps mean in the context of the search models. They're seeking clarification. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to determine if this is explicit or implicit. The reviewer is asking a question, which is a form of clarification. It's not giving a direct action to take, but it's seeking to understand something. So, it's more of an implicit action. \n\nNext, is it concrete or vague? The reviewer is asking about the meaning of 100 steps, but they're not providing any specific action beyond that. They're just asking for an explanation. So, it's vague because the reviewer isn't suggesting how to proceed or what to do with that information. \n\nTherefore, this review point is **Borderline Actionable** because it's implicitly asking for clarification but isn't providing concrete steps or actions.\n\nMoving on to **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer is referring to \"Search models comparison 5.1\" and asking about 100 steps. They're directly referencing a specific section of the paper, which is section 5.1. This shows that the reviewer can identify the specific part of the paper being discussed. Additionally, they're asking about what 100 steps mean, which is a clear question about the content within that section. \n\nSo, the grounding is strong because the reviewer can pinpoint the section, and the specificity is clear as they're asking about the meaning within that section. Therefore, this review point is **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is asking a question seeking clarification. There's no claim being made here; it's purely a question. Since there's no claim, it doesn't fall under verifiability. So, this should be marked as **X: No Claim**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is asking for clarification on a specific part of the paper. While this can help the author understand the context better, it doesn't provide actionable suggestions or identify weaknesses. It's more of a clarifying question rather than a constructive critique or suggestion. \n\nTherefore, this review point is **Somewhat Helpful** because it does provide some insight but lacks depth and direction for improvement.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: Borderline Actionable (2)\n- Grounding Specificity: Fully Grounded and Specific (5)\n- Verifiability: No Claim (X)\n- Helpfulness: Somewhat Helpful (3)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"X\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

The review points out that the first two sections are hard to read because the author stacked previous approaches without clear explanations. It then provides specific examples, like questions about converting a stacked LSTM to a sequential one and an unclear sentence about hierarchical layers. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The reviewer does give specific questions, which are explicit. However, the questions are quite detailed and might require the author to infer how to address them. For example, the reviewer asks about h_{t-1}^{1..5} in Figure 2(b), which the author might need to figure out themselves. So, while the comments are explicit, they might be a bit vague in terms of how to apply the changes. Maybe they could have provided more direct instructions or examples. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because the actions are clear but could be more direct.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer refers to specific sections of the paper, like Figures 2(a) and 2(b), and mentions line numbers. They also ask about specific parts of the text, like the unclear sentence. This means the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the areas in the paper that need improvement. Additionally, they are asking the author to explain certain technical details, which adds specificity. So, this seems like **Fully Grounded and Specific** because the reviewer is not only pointing out the sections but also asking for detailed explanations.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is making claims by suggesting that the author's approach is unclear and that specific technical points need clarification. These are subjective opinions, so they are claims. Now, the reviewer provides some reasoning, like asking the author to explain the LSTM conversion and the hierarchical layers. However, they don't cite external references or provide logical reasoning beyond the questions. The justification is there but could be more robust.

The reviewer is pointing out areas where the author's work is unclear and provides specific questions to guide the author. While it's helpful, it could be more detailed. For example, instead of just asking about h_{t-1}^{1..5}, the reviewer could suggest specific changes or provide examples.

It doesn't tell the authors exactly how to implement the comparison, though. So, it's explicit but not very detailed on the action. I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to PhaseNet-Das and mentions the need for a proof of concept. It doesn't explicitly name the section of the paper where the comparison should be made, but it's clear that it's about comparing against existing methods.

Considering the nonlinear expression ability of neural networks, how to explain that the data distribution illustrated in Figure 1 is inseparable from the network model?\" \n\nFirst, does this give an explicit action? It suggests looking into why the data distribution is inseparable, which is an action. But is it vague? The reviewer is asking for an explanation, which is a bit broad. So, it's not fully actionable because the user would need to figure out how to approach the explanation themselves. Maybe it's borderline actionable because it's explicit but vague on the method.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions Figure 1, which is specific. They're pointing out a particular data distribution, so that's good grounding. They also reference neural networks' nonlinear abilities, which is a specific point in the paper. So, this seems fully grounded because they're clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper and the issue is well-defined.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting that the data distribution is inseparable from the model. They're asking for an explanation, which is a claim. But they don't provide any justification or references. They're just posing a question without supporting evidence. So, this is unverifiable because there's no backing for the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a problem in the synthetic experiment and asking for an explanation. This is helpful because it identifies an issue. However, the question is quite open-ended and doesn't provide specific guidance on how to address it. It might be somewhat helpful but lacks depth. So, it's a 3 on the helpfulness scale because it's somewhat helpful but not fully comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat Actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\n- Verifiability: 1 (Unverifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (Somewhat Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It mentions that this makes it difficult for practical applications. Now, actionability is about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The comment points out a problem (low efficiency) but doesn't specify what needs to be done to fix it. It's more of a statement than an actionable suggestion. So, it's not explicit or concrete.

The review says, \"I would tone down this statement, in my understanding, the neural network does not memorize an exact 'critical point' as such in TopoNet [24].\" The author is suggesting a change to a specific citation. That's explicit, so it's actionable. Now, is it concrete? The author is telling the reviewer to tone down, but they don't specify exactly how. They mention that the neural network doesn't memorize exact critical points, which gives a clear direction. So, it's explicit and gives a direction, but the specifics are a bit vague. I think this is 4: Mostly Actionable because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detail on how to implement it.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions \"in TopoNet [24]\" which is specific. They also refer to \"neural network does not memorize an exact 'critical point' as such.\" The specific part is the neural network's inability to memorize exact critical points. So, the grounding is strong because they pinpoint the section and the issue. It's not a general comment, so I'd rate this as 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the review contains a claim that the neural network doesn't memorize exact critical points. The reviewer provides a reference [24], which is external support. They also mention their understanding, which adds some justification. So, the claim is supported by evidence, making it 4: Mostly Verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer gives clear feedback, suggesting a tone adjustment and explaining why they think the neural network doesn't memorize exact points. They also point out grammatical errors. This is helpful because it guides the author on specific improvements. It's somewhat detailed but could be more comprehensive.

It suggests that if COCO-LM is parameter-efficient, the conclusion applies to these others. The reviewer then asks about switching BPE types. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions. The reviewer is pointing out that the comparison is overrated and lists other models, which is explicit. However, the specific action is to ask a question about BPE types. It's not giving a direct action like suggesting a change or providing data. So, it's more of an implicit action. Therefore, it's not highly actionable because the action isn't explicit. Maybe a 3 or 4? Since it's explicit about the overrating but vague on how to apply it, I think 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about other models but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're addressing. They mention BPE types but don't clearly identify the section or part of the paper. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. They mention unique elements like BPE types, which is good, but overall, it's not fully grounded. Maybe a 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific? Wait, no. They mention specific elements but don't clearly identify the part. So, it's weakly grounded but specific in what they're saying. Hmm, maybe 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by pointing out that the comparison is overrated and suggesting the conclusion applies to other models. They're asking a question, which is a claim. They don't provide evidence or justification for why the comparison is overrated or why BPE types matter. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. Maybe a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a flaw in the comparison and suggesting the conclusion applies elsewhere.

It points out that the GS-P-50 model has a smaller class selectivity score, implying it shares more features with ResNet-50, which learns more class-specific features. The authors hypothesize that additional context could reduce dependency. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is making a connection between class selectivity and the model's ability to learn better representations. It's not a direct action like suggesting a change or a specific fix, but it's pointing out an observation that could lead to an improvement. So, it's somewhat actionable because it suggests looking into class selectivity and how adding context might help. But it's vague on how to proceed, so maybe it's not fully actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions the histogram in Fig 3 and references two external papers. They clearly identify the specific part of the paper (lines 128-149, the figure, and the two references). So, the grounding is strong because they're pointing to exact sections and providing context with references.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the analysis isn't convincing enough.

So, I think this is **4: Mostly Actionable** because while the action is inferred, the details are provided.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about the experimental comparison being unfair. They mention the pre-training step and the performance without SSL. They also refer to Table 1, which suggests they can accurately pinpoint where the issue lies. So, they have full grounding because they're referring to a specific part of the paper (the comparison section and Table 1). They also clearly specify what needs to be addressed, which is the fairness and the pre-training issue. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the comparison is unfair and suggests that the pre-trained models might not be on the same scale. They provide some reasoning about the pre-training step and the performance metrics. However, they don't cite external references or specific literature to back this up. The reasoning is logical but lacks concrete external support. So, this would be **3: Somewhat Verifiable** because there's some justification but it's not fully robust.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue in the comparison and suggesting improvements. They provide some reasoning about the pre-training and the performance without SSL. However, the suggestion is somewhat vague in terms of how to fix it. They don't specify exact changes or provide references for further reading. So, it's helpful but not the most detailed. I'd rate this as **4: Mostly Helpful** because it gives meaningful feedback that could guide the authors, though it could be expanded.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 4\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 3\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It's an explicit action because it directly tells the authors where to find more information.

The review mentions \"better meta-data embeddings\" without clearly pointing to a specific part of the paper. It refers to a specific section (table 1 of another paper), which is a weak ground because it's not the main part of the current paper. The specificity is okay because it mentions what to look at, but it's not very clear.

It's supported by referring to another paper, which is a good external reference. The reasoning is logical, explaining that better embeddings can lead to better performance. So, this should be **4: Mostly Verifiable** because it's well-supported but maybe lacks a bit more detail on how exactly the embeddings would be used.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a potential improvement but doesn't provide concrete steps or data on how the new embeddings would perform.

They mention that \"X\" should be a multiset, which is a specific part of the paper. They're not making any vague references or educated guesses; they're directly pointing to a section. So, this is fully grounded because they're accurately pinpointing the section. Additionally, they're specific about the change needed, so this is also specific. Therefore, grounding_specificity should be 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that \"X\" should be a multiset. This is a clear claim because they're stating an opinion or judgment about the paper's use of sets versus multisets. Now, is this claim supported? Well, the reviewer is suggesting a change, but they don't provide any justification or references. They're just pointing out that multisets are needed. Without supporting evidence, the claim isn't fully verifiable.

That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to classical learning theory and Bayesian-PAC bounds. It doesn't explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, just the approach. It's a bit vague about where the problem lies. So, it's weakly grounded because it's not pinpointing a section but is somewhat specific about the type of bounds. I think this would be a 3.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim that classical bounds aren't realistic without Bayesian methods. It supports this with knowledge of Bayesian-PAC bounds, which is a good external reference. So, it's somewhat verifiable but not fully.

It suggests that the fine-tuning was done for 10 epochs without early-stopping and that ablation studies are needed. The action here is clear: the authors should perform ablation studies. The instructions say that explicit actions are good, and this seems to be an explicit action. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells them exactly what to do\u2014run ablation studies. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out that the fine-tuning was done without validation early-stopping on GLUE, which is a specific part of the paper. It mentions the number of epochs and the lack of early-stopping, which are specific details. The grounding is strong because it clearly references the methodology section where these parameters are discussed. The specificity is also good because it explains what needs to be addressed. So this should be fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests that ablation studies are needed. This is a claim because it's making a judgment about the necessity of these studies. The justification provided is that GLUE tasks have high variance without validation, so ablation is needed. This is logical reasoning and provides specific examples (GLUE tasks) to support the claim.

That's an explicit action, so it's clear. Then, it talks about the experiments on CIFAR not being convincing, specifically pointing out that the continual learning literature has extensive experiments on the dataset, and the paper only compares to one approach (DEN). It suggests that the authors should use the same setup as DEN to make the comparison fair.

The review mentions specific experiments and references other work, so it's clearly pointing to specific parts of the paper. It also provides specific suggestions about the comparison setup, which makes it well-grounded. The specificity is high because it's not just talking about the dataset but about the comparison method and setup, so I'd rate this as fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor Verifiability, the review provides logical reasoning by explaining why the comparison isn't convincing and suggests a specific improvement. It references existing literature, which adds credibility. The suggestions are clear and supported by external references, so this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness.

It also points out that this comes at the cost of less information compared to DAGs from [10]. The reviewer then asks how much information of a DAG is encoded in its ancestral graph. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if this comment gives clear instructions on what to do. The reviewer is asking a question, which is a common way to suggest improvement, but it's more of a clarifying question. It doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to change or how to proceed. So, it's not fully actionable. It's more of a suggestion for further analysis rather than a direct instruction. Therefore, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an area for improvement but doesn't provide explicit steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to ancestral graphs and DAGs, which are specific parts of the paper. It mentions [10], a specific reference, so the grounding is strong. The reviewer is addressing a specific comparison between two methods, which makes it clear which part of the paper is being discussed. Additionally, the comment explains the trade-off in detail, which adds specificity about what's missing in the ancestral graph.

This is a subjective judgment. To verify this, the reviewer could provide references or logical reasoning. However, the comment doesn't cite any external sources or explain why ancestral graphs have less information. It's a valid claim, but the justification is lacking.

They're suggesting that RepPoints regresses distance to feature maps, while anchor-based does something else. They're claiming that the difference isn't significant. To verify this, we need to see if they provide justification. They mention that ATSS literature shows regression methods don't influence much, and that anchor-based methods are good enough. This provides some reasoning, so it's somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is asking for clarification and points out that the motivation isn't solid.

It's vague about the exact issue, so the grounding is weak. It doesn't clearly identify the referenced part or provide specific details. Therefore, this is **2: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests a comparison but doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification. It's vague and lacks references or logical reasoning. So, it's **1: Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review raises concerns about computational complexity and power demand but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or solutions. It's more of a critique without actionable steps, making it somewhat helpful but not very useful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out that the authors made a specific claim about their model's behavior, referencing Section 3 of Wang et al., 2023. It says the heads are active at S2 but not the primary focus. The comment is explicit about the correction, so that's good. It also provides a clear direction for the authors to check their model against the literature, which is a concrete action. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions a specific section of the paper (Section 3) and clearly states what's wrong with the authors' claim. It doesn't just say \"they're wrong\" but explains why based on external literature. This makes it fully grounded because it references a specific part of the paper and provides a rationale for the correction.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment references an external source (Wang et al., 2023) and explains why the authors' statement is incorrect. This provides a logical reasoning and a reference, making it fully verifiable. There's no ambiguity here, so it's a high score.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific mistake and providing a clear correction. It's not just vague advice but a direct fix. This should be highly helpful because it guides the authors on exactly what to do next, which is essential for improving their work.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each aspect scores a 5 because the review is explicit, well-supported, and directly instructive for the authors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

The action here is pointing out an issue and suggesting a solution. It's explicit, so that's good. The suggestion is clear about where to look for examples, so it's concrete. I think this is highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment refers to specific sections of the paper, like lines 229 to 253, which makes it grounded. It's not just a vague statement; it clearly points to a part of the paper. So, grounding is strong here.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review cites a literature source on SNLI, which is a well-known resource. This external reference makes the claim verifiable. The reasoning is clear and provides a solid justification, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and provides a clear suggestion to look elsewhere for examples.

It suggests that this limitation should be made clearer. The action here is pointing out a limitation and recommending clarification. It's explicit because it directly states the issue and the need for improvement. As for concreteness, it doesn't specify exactly how to clarify but gives a direction. So I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but lacks detailed guidance.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to RBF kernels and RKHS being infinite-dimensional, which is specific. It also mentions that neural networks can't handle this in practice, which is a clear reference to a specific part of the paper. The grounding is strong because it accurately points to the kernel discussion and the RKHS concept. The specificity is also good because it explains why the limitation exists. So this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that neural networks can't represent infinite-dimensional RKHSs.

Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it hints at something but doesn't tell them exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment references specific works, which helps the authors identify where to look. It's not just a vague statement; it points them to existing literature. So, this is fully grounded because it clearly mentions specific references, aiding the authors in pinpointing relevant works.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review provides references to existing literature, which supports the claim that the idea is well-known.

So, it's not giving the authors a clear action to take. That makes it unactionable because they don't know what to do next. So, I'd give it a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions the technical contribution is limited but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's too vague. The authors can't pinpoint where the issue is, so it's not grounded. That's a 1 here.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the technical contribution is limited.

It also points out that the results are similar to another method. Now, looking at the definition, actionability is about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. Here, the review is pointing out issues but doesn't suggest fixes. It just states facts. So, it's not actionable because the authors don't know what changes to make. Therefore, it's unactionable, which is a 1.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review talks about specific models and strategies, so it does ground the discussion in specific parts of the paper. It mentions \"MLP, Regression Tree or Random Forest\" and \"epsilon-greedy and exactly the same as that in BRP-NAS[5].\" This means it accurately points to the sections being discussed, so grounding specificity is high.

It also talks about an ablation study showing limited improvement. So, the comment is pointing out issues but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. It's more like a critique without clear steps for improvement. That makes it **Borderline Actionable** because it hints at problems but doesn't give explicit directions.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to the transformer's lack of novelty, which is a general statement. It doesn't point to a specific part of the paper, like a particular section or figure. It also mentions the ablation study but doesn't clearly explain why it's relevant.

It explains that the self-cross attention didn't improve much and suggests that the main gains came from a different approach. However, the reasoning is a bit vague, and it could benefit from more specific references or examples.

It points out that existing methods use smaller datasets, like GEM with 20M unlabeled data. The reviewer is suggesting that the scale impacts accuracy, implying that the proposed method's superiority is due to the new large dataset. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with the comparison but doesn't specify what needs to be done. They're suggesting that the larger dataset might be the reason for the improvement, but they don't offer a concrete fix or alternative approach. So, it's more of an implicit suggestion rather than an explicit action.

It suggests the paragraph provides little value. Is this explicit? Yes, it mentions DNNs and states it's not central. But is it concrete? It tells the author to focus on other parts instead of DNNs. So, it's explicit and concrete. So, I think it's highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, Grounding_specificity. The review mentions DNNs but doesn't tie it to the paper's focus on drift. It's a general statement about the Introduction. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint where the issue is. It's not fully grounded. But it's specific in pointing out the DNN part. So, I'd rate this as somewhat grounded and specific, maybe a 3.\n\nVerifiability. The review claims that the DNN intro is not central. Is this a claim? Yes. Is there any support?

It's pointing out an area for improvement. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The comment is directly telling the authors to clarify, so that's explicit. Is it concrete? It tells them exactly where to focus their clarification, so yes, it's concrete. So on the actionability scale, this should be a 5 because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity.

It says the regret cannot be sublinear but the proof shows T^{1/2} regret. The reviewer is asking if the prediction error over T cannot be sublinear. This is a clear question that the authors can address by looking at the proof. So, it's an explicit action, and the authors know exactly what to check.

It also talks about the required feature size increasing exponentially with M, the dependence on \u03b5, and the performance shown in Figure 1. \n\nNow, for actionability, I need to see if the review is explicit and concrete. The review does suggest that the exponential dependence is a weakness, which is an explicit action. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to fix it or what changes to make. It's more of a statement of a problem rather than a clear action plan. So, it's explicit but not concrete. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to specific results like Corollaries and Theorems, which is good. It also mentions Figure 1, which is a specific part of the paper. However, it doesn't explain why this is a problem or how it affects the overall work. It just states the issue. So, the grounding is clear, but the specificity about what needs to be addressed is somewhat lacking. I think this falls under **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention the specific parts but doesn't elaborate on the implications.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the exponential dependence is a weakness. It supports this by stating that the required feature size increases with M and that Figure 1 shows poor performance. However, the explanation is a bit vague. It mentions the dependence on \u03b5 but doesn't provide concrete examples or external references. So, it's somewhat supported but not fully. This would be **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out specific issues in the results and mentions a figure, which is helpful.

So, I think this is borderline actionable because it's clear the author needs to explain something, but the specifics aren't given.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is pointing out a specific part of the paper, right before Appendix D.2. So the author can identify exactly where the issue is. Additionally, it's asking for an explanation, which is clear.

To verify this, the author would need to check the methods or results sections for details. While it's a claim, the justification is provided by the fact that it's referencing a known concept (epsilon-greedy) and the context implies where to look for more information.

I think this is highly actionable because it tells them exactly what to do without leaving room for interpretation.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review talks about the model description needing improvement but doesn't specify which part. It mentions the generative process and a notation table but doesn't point to a specific section or figure in the paper. So the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. They know it's in the description but not the exact location.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The review suggests changes but doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why the current model description is problematic. It just states that the generative process should be in steps and a notation table would help. There's no reference to external studies or common practices supporting these suggestions. So this is unverifiable because there's no backing for the claims made.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review offers specific suggestions for improvement, which is good. It tells the authors exactly what to do without being too vague. However, it doesn't explain why these changes are necessary or how they would improve the model. Without justification, the suggestions might not be as helpful. So it's somewhat helpful because it provides actionable points, but it lacks the reasoning behind them.\n\nPutting it all together: Actionability is highly actionable (5), grounding specificity is weak (1), verifiability is unverifiable (1), and helpfulness is somewhat helpful (3).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

Let's go through each aspect one by one.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests the paper needs better motivation. It's explicit because it directly tells the authors to improve the \"Why\" section. However, it's vague because it doesn't specify how to add motivation or what parts to focus on. So, it's not fully actionable but provides a clear direction. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment doesn't mention a specific part of the paper. It's a general suggestion to improve the introduction. Since it doesn't pinpoint where the motivation should be added, the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it doesn't reference any specific section or element of the paper. So, this would be \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific.\"\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a judgment about the paper's need for motivation but doesn't provide any evidence or justification. It's just a suggestion without supporting reasons or references. Therefore, it's \"Unverifiable\" because there's no backing for why adding motivation is necessary.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The suggestion is clear and relevant, as motivation is crucial for the paper's impact. However, it's vague in terms of how to implement it. While it's helpful, it doesn't offer detailed guidance. So, it's \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it provides some value but lacks depth in actionable steps.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: Somewhat Actionable (4)\n- Grounding Specificity: Weakly Grounded and Not Specific (2)\n- Verifiability: Unverifiable (1)\n- Helpfulness: Somewhat Helpful (3)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Unverifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

It also points out that the baselines haven't explored this trade-off. The comment is explicit about the issues but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. It's more of a critique without concrete steps, so it's not actionable. I think this is borderline because it does point out problems but doesn't give clear fixes.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to Table 5 and specific categories, which should help the authors pinpoint where improvements can be made. It mentions Decouple by name and talks about hyper-parameters, which are specific parts of the model. This seems well-grounded because it's pointing to specific sections and methods. The specificity is good because it clearly states what needs to be looked into.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the proposed method is worse or not as effective as Decouple. It supports this by citing the performance metrics and the trade-off analysis. The references to specific experiments and hyper-parameters make the claim verifiable. It's mostly supported but could be clearer, so I'd rate it as somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about the shortcomings and suggests improvements, which is helpful. It's pointing out specific areas for the authors to focus on, which is better than just saying the paper isn't ready. It's somewhat helpful because it could be more detailed, but it's definitely useful.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the review is somewhat actionable, fully grounded, somewhat verifiable, and somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

The prompt requires 'all of the structured elements for perspectives to be present in the generated tweets', which doesn't see the most realistic. The generation of authors is also not realistic ('[author] embeddings are initialized by averaging the corresponding artificial tweets').\" \n\nLooking at this, the reviewer is suggesting specific actions, like evaluating the realism of the tweets and the author embeddings. However, the instructions are a bit vague. They mention the need for structured elements but don't provide clear steps on how to improve that. So, while the actions are explicit, they lack concrete details on how to implement these changes. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about \"how realistic are the evaluated tweets\" and mentions specific issues like the prompt requiring structured elements and the author embeddings being initialized from artificial tweets. They clearly identify the parts of the paper being addressed, like the evaluation method and the generation process. Additionally, they specify what needs improvement, which makes the grounding quite solid. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer's claims are that weak supervision needs better evaluation, the prompt isn't realistic, and the author embeddings are initialized incorrectly. These are clear claims with logical reasoning. They don't reference external literature, but the logic is sound. So, this is **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides specific feedback on areas needing improvement but doesn't suggest alternative approaches or how to fix them. It's clear and points out issues, making it somewhat helpful.

It's explicit because it's stating a clear action\u2014comparing with another model. But is it concrete? The comment doesn't specify how to perform this comparison, like whether it's a direct comparison or what metrics to use. So it's explicit but vague. That would make it a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions a specific paper, Revisiting Visual Question Answering Baselines. That's a clear reference, so grounding is strong. It also specifies the comparison, which adds to the specificity. So this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting a specific comparison. It's supported by citing a paper, which is a strong external reference. The reasoning is clear, so this is fully verifiable. That gives it a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides a clear suggestion to compare with another model, which is helpful. It's specific and gives a direction for the authors.

It suggests trimming. Now, is this explicit? The reviewer is pointing out the design choice and suggesting a change, so that's an explicit action. Is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly what to do: trim the questions. So this is highly actionable. I think it should be a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the design choice but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It just says \"the question model is just a bag of words.\" So the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific section or unique aspect. It's more of a general statement. Therefore, grounding_specificity would be 3 because it's weakly grounded but specific in the sense that it's clear what's being criticized.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the design choice is odd and suggests trimming. They're not providing any external references or logical reasoning beyond the nature of the model. It's a subjective judgment without much justification. So this is borderline verifiable, maybe a 2.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific issue and suggesting a change. It's clear and actionable, so it should be helpful.

The reviewer is pointing out that the reader might not understand the equation, which is a clear action. However, the review doesn't provide any specific instructions on how to fix it, so it's not very actionable. It's more of a question than a suggestion, so I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is addressing Equation (2) specifically, so they've clearly identified the part of the paper. This is fully grounded because they're pointing to a specific section. The comment is also specific about the equation, so it's not just a general statement. Therefore, this scores a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is pointing out a potential issue without providing any justification or references.

It's pretty explicit about these actions, so that's good. But does it tell the authors exactly how to do it? It just says to move them, not how to edit the document or where to place them. So it's explicit but not very detailed. I think that's a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review points out specific sections in the supplementary materials, like L502, L507, and L509. It's pretty clear which parts are being referenced, so the grounding is strong. It doesn't mention anything vague or require the authors to guess. So I'd give this a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is making claims about the formatting issues and suggesting changes. It's not just stating facts; it's giving recommendations. Now, are these claims supported? The reviewer is just stating what needs to be done, not citing any external references or logical reasoning. So it's a bit vague. Maybe a 2 for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review does point out specific issues and suggests fixes.

It's explicit about the references and provides a clear action, which is to compare with GFF and EfficientFCN. The action is explicit, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The suggestion is to compare, but it doesn't specify how to do that, like whether to include ablation studies or just mention it. So, it's explicit but not concrete. Therefore, it should be **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to GFF and EfficientFCN by their citations, which is explicit. It also mentions the societal impact on the last page, which is specific. So, the grounding is both explicit and specific. That makes it **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that references are missing and suggests a comparison. The suggestion is clear and provides a logical reasoning to compare with these works, which is a form of justification. It doesn't cite external references beyond what's already mentioned, but the reasoning is solid.

It also suggests that the algorithm might fail in practice and calls for experimental results. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue with the Vandermonde matrix, which is a clear action. However, the suggestion to provide experimental results is more of an implicit action because it's not directly telling the authors how to implement it. So, it's partially actionable but not fully because the action isn't entirely explicit.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer refers to the Vandermonde matrix by name, which is specific, so that's good. They also mention the parameters n, k, and L, which are specific parts of the paper. Additionally, they suggest providing experimental results, which is a clear indication of what needs to be done. So, this seems well-grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**.

It also suggests a comparison and discussion, which are specific tasks. Therefore, it's **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment recommends including specific works and comparing them. While it's a good suggestion, it doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning to back up why these comparisons are necessary. It's somewhat justified but lacks depth.

The review says the author is confused about the phrase \"non-sequential information such as chunks.\" The reviewer is pointing out that the term \"chunk\" might not be the best choice because it's not clear if it's sequential or not. The reviewer suggests using \"non-sequential\" instead. Is this explicit? Yes, the reviewer is giving a direct suggestion. Is it concrete? The reviewer explains why \"chunk\" might be confusing and offers a specific alternative. So, this is highly actionable because the author knows exactly what to change and how.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer mentions \"non-sequential information such as chunks.\" They're referring to a specific part of the paper, which is the discussion of the term \"chunk.\" The reviewer is pointing out an issue with how that term is used. So, the grounding is clear and specific. The reviewer isn't making educated guesses; they're directly addressing the term mentioned in the paper. Therefore, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a judgment that the term \"chunk\" is confusing and suggests a better alternative. This is a claim because it's an opinion or judgment about the paper. The justification is that \"chunk\" is ambiguous and that \"non-sequential\" is clearer. This is logical reasoning and provides a specific example, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer's comment is clear, directly addresses a potential issue, and provides a constructive suggestion. It helps the author understand where the confusion is and what to improve. This is highly helpful because it's specific, actionable, and well-supported.\n\nSo, all four aspects are scored as 5 because each is highly effective in guiding the author's improvements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests that the patches are just masked versions with most pixels black, which might be misleading. The reviewer also recommends using bilinear sampling for zooming. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer does mention a specific issue with the description of the patches and provides a suggestion for improvement. However, the suggestion is quite vague\u2014just recommending bilinear sampling without explaining why it's better or how to implement it. So, it's explicit about the issue but lacks concrete details on how to fix it. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer refers to equation 9 and Figure 1, which are specific parts of the paper. They mention the patches and the misleading nature of Figure 1. The mention is clear and specific, so the grounding is strong. They also point out what's wrong in those parts, which adds specificity to their comment.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer makes a claim that the patches are just masked versions with most pixels black. They back this up by questioning the correctness of Figure 1 and suggesting an alternative method. The reasoning is clear and logical, providing a justification for their claim. They also reference common knowledge about image processing techniques, which adds to the verifiability. So, this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment raises a valid concern and provides a constructive suggestion.

It points out that the idea, co-attention mechanism, and architecture are similar. Now, is this an explicit or implicit action? The comment is stating a fact without suggesting a specific change. It doesn't tell the authors what to do next, just points out a similarity. So, it's implicit. Since it's not giving a clear instruction, it's not highly actionable. Maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to specific papers but doesn't mention exact sections or unique aspects of the paper. It's a general comparison.

It explicitly states the action of comparing with another pre-trained model, which is clear. The action is explicit, so that's good. Now, is it concrete? The review mentions ExpertBert specifically, so the authors know exactly who to compare with. There's no ambiguity here. So, this should be highly actionable because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions ExpertBert as a specific model.

For (2.a), it's asking for clarification on the order of temperature calibration. That's a direct action the authors can take. Then, for (2.b), it's suggesting that reducing entropy makes predictions more confident, which goes against the paper's motivation. This is also a clear action.

So, the grounding is strong because it accurately identifies the sections being discussed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the claims made are supported by logical reasoning. The reviewer explains why temperature calibration needs to be after training and how reducing entropy affects confidence. These are clear explanations and logical deductions, so the verifiability is high.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review addresses two clear issues, provides actionable suggestions, and connects them to the paper's motivation.

The review is making a judgment about the paper's strength but isn't suggesting specific changes. It's vague, so it's not actionable. It doesn't tell the authors what to fix or how to improve. So, it's borderline actionable because it's clear the paper isn't good enough, but there's no specific guidance. Maybe a 2?\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer is saying the paper isn't strong enough, but they don't specify which part. They're not pointing to a particular section or issue. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint where the problem is. Maybe a 3?\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the paper isn't strong enough, but there's no justification or evidence provided. They're just stating an opinion without backing it up. So, it's unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment is critical but lacks specifics.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that experiments should be run multiple times and suggests a community effort for reproducibility. It also points out that running multiple experiments is critical and should be reported with statistics. The explicit action here is to run multiple experiments, which is clear. The suggestion to report statistics adds more detail, making it concrete. So, this is highly actionable because the author isn't just giving a vague recommendation but is specifying exactly what needs to be done.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to a specific paper [a] by Henderson et al. for the reproducibility issue. It also mentions the critical consideration of running multiple experiments. The grounding is strong because it explicitly mentions the paper and the specific aspect of the paper (reproducibility and multiple experiments). The specificity comes from the fact that it's not just talking about reproducibility but also about the necessity of multiple runs and statistical reporting. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review cites a specific paper as justification for the suggestion on reproducibility. It also explains why running multiple experiments is important\u2014because of the lack of reproducibility in deep RL. The reasoning is logical, and the reference is external, making it verifiable. There's no claim without support, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions on how to improve the reproducibility of their experiments, mentions a specific paper, and explains the importance of their suggestion. This is very helpful because it guides the authors on what to do and why, making it actionable and informative. It's not just a vague comment but offers concrete steps and references, so it's highly helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect scores a 5 because they are all highly actionable, grounded and specific, fully verifiable, and highly helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

However, it doesn't specify how to improve the methods or what changes are needed. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to \"the majority of language and score combinations\" and \"idiomatic vs random data.\" It doesn't clearly point to a specific part of the paper, so the grounding is weak. It's not fully grounded because it's too vague.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that the impact is similar without providing evidence or references.

It suggests comparing test accuracy but doesn't specify how. So, the action is implicit because the authors need to infer where to make the comparison. It's vague because it doesn't provide exact steps or metrics. So, this is borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to Sections 3.4 and 3.5, which are specific parts of the paper. It mentions training loss and rank but not test accuracy. So, the grounding is clear because it points to specific sections, but the specificity is lacking because it doesn't detail what exactly is missing in terms of comparison.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim that there's an improvement over the baseline because PRANC is modified. However, the justification is vague\u2014it mentions test accuracy but doesn't provide evidence or references.

It also recommends explaining the Neurochaos Learning method. The comment is explicit about the need for more details and provides clear actions, so it's actionable. It doesn't just state the problem but also offers solutions, making it more than just a directive. So, this should be a high score.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out that the model architecture and learning details are missing. It suggests specific solutions like plots, tables, or code repositories. It doesn't just refer to vague sections but provides concrete examples of what should be included. This makes it well-grounded because it clearly identifies where the issues lie and what needs to be added. So, this should be a high score as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review advises the authors to provide integrated details for reproducibility. It references Neurochaos Learning, which is not well-known, so the suggestion is based on external knowledge. It's logical and provides a clear recommendation, so it's verifiable. It doesn't just state a problem but also gives a justified reason for the suggestion, making it fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is clear about the issues and provides actionable suggestions.

It suggests this could break acceleration techniques like quantization and sparsification. \n\nFor actionability, it's about how clear and helpful the suggestions are. The review explicitly states the issue (not mentioning global Q values) and suggests a problem with acceleration techniques. However, it doesn't provide concrete steps on what the authors should do next. They might need to look into global Q values or compare with average gradients. So, it's explicit but lacks specific guidance on how to implement the fix. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to large networks and mentions acceleration techniques like quantization and sparsification. It doesn't explicitly name a specific part of the paper, like a particular section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing an exact area. But it does imply the issue is with the training process and the techniques used, which is somewhat specific. So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that not mentioning global Q values could break acceleration techniques. It provides some reasoning about how this might affect quantization and sparsification. However, it's a bit vague and doesn't give concrete references or examples. It's clear there's a problem, but the justification isn't thorough.

It doesn't provide external references or logical reasoning to back up these claims. It's just stating that the notation is inconsistent without explaining why or citing anything. So, it's not verifiable because there's no supporting evidence. This would be a 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out issues in the Methodology but doesn't offer detailed suggestions on how to improve it. It mentions the confusion with notation but doesn't specify what changes should be made. While it's somewhat helpful, it lacks depth and clarity.

Well, the reviewer is pointing out specific errors in the authors' claim. It's clear what the mistake is, so the authors can directly fix their statement. That seems explicit. Also, the reviewer provides clear examples, like non-asymptotic and finite combinations, which gives the authors exactly what to change. So, this is both explicit and concrete.

The review mentions that the paper only considered label names, descriptions, and few-shot examples, but claims to have used annotation guidelines. It provides an example from TACRED about city of birth. The comment suggests that the paper's approach might be an overstatement because annotation guidelines are complex and involve rules beyond just label names. \n\nIs this actionable? It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a potential issue but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. They mention the complexity of guidelines but don't provide a clear action or suggestion on how to improve the paper. So, it's not explicit or direct. It's more of an observation without a clear next step. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because it's vague on how to apply the feedback.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**.

They mention that the paper didn't consider the complexity of these guidelines, which were curated by linguists. The comment is specific about the example from TACRED, which is a unique aspect of their field. So, the reviewer can confidently identify which part of the paper is being addressed\u2014the annotation guidelines\u2014and they also specify what's missing. This makes the grounding quite solid.

The reviewer's claim is that the paper's approach is an overstatement because annotation guidelines are complicated. They provide an example from a specific paper. This is a claim because it's making a judgment about the paper's method. The justification includes a reference to a well-known guideline document and an example. This is logical reasoning and external references, making the claim verifiable. It's fully verifiable because the evidence is clear and directly supports the claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

It seems like it's asking a question, which might be a way to guide the author to think about the implications. But is it explicit? The user is prompting the author to consider a scenario, which could be inferred. So, it's not directly telling them what to do, just asking a question. That makes it more implicit.

So, this is \"Fully Grounded and Specific\" because it accurately identifies the sections and clearly states what needs addressing.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that excessive risk values in the figures are positive and asks if they're comparable across groups. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning to support this claim. It's more of a statement requiring justification. So, this is \"Unverifiable\" because there's no supporting evidence or justification given.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is somewhat helpful because it points out specific areas for the authors to improve, like explaining a concept and providing calculation details. However, it's vague and doesn't offer much depth or guidance. It could be more helpful if it provided clearer suggestions or examples. So, I'd rate this as \"Somewhat Helpful\" because it does address some issues but lacks clarity and depth.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: Somewhat Actionable (3)\n- Grounding Specificity: Fully Grounded and Specific (5)\n- Verifiability: Unverifiable (1)\n- Helpfulness: Somewhat Helpful (3)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Unverifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that the motivation is unclear and talks about the difficulty in predicting occluded objects. It also asks about downstream applications and handling uncertainty. I think this is more of a question than an actionable suggestion. The authors aren't given clear steps to improve their work; instead, they're asked to consider applications and handle uncertainty, which is vague. So, this isn't very actionable. Maybe a 2 because it's somewhat implied but not clear.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to amodal tracking and mentions uncertainty but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly is problematic. It's too vague about the specific issue, so the grounding isn't strong. It's probably a 2 because it's weakly grounded but mentions the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification. It just states that the motivation is unclear and asks questions without backing them up. So, this is unverifiable. That would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking questions and discussing potential applications but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or solutions. It's more of a discussion than helpful feedback. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth.

{"generated_text": "Alright, I need to evaluate the given review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let's go through each aspect one by one.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review point is asking for examples of \"unreliable neighbors\" in lines 170-171. It's a direct question, so the action is explicit. However, it doesn't provide any specific guidance on how to find or address these examples. It's vague because the user needs to look for examples themselves. So, this is borderline actionable because the action is clear, but the details are missing.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment refers to \"unreliable neighbors\" without specifying which part of the paper or where to look. It doesn't mention any specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's not fully grounded.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it suggests that examples of \"unreliable neighbors\" exist. However, it doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just stating that examples exist without supporting evidence, so it's unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is asking for examples but doesn't provide any. It's vague and lacks direction. So, it's not helpful at all because the authors don't get any actionable feedback or guidance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"1\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"1\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review mentions that prior knowledge isn't always available and might be inaccurate for specific subpopulations. It suggests focusing on mining causal relationships from data automatically. The comment is explicit about the issue and provides a clear action, which is to focus on data mining. So, it's explicit and concrete. That should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to the issue of prior knowledge being unavailable or inaccurate, specifically for subpopulations. It doesn't mention a specific part of the paper but clearly points out a problem. It's not weakly grounded because it's making a general statement about the practicality of relying on prior knowledge. So, it's fully grounded but not very specific. Wait, no, actually, it's a bit vague in pointing out the problem. It's more about the practicality in general. So maybe it's weakly grounded because it's not pinning down a specific section but rather a general concern. Hmm, but the grounding is about how specific the comment is about the paper. Since it's about the practicality issue in general, I think it's weakly grounded. But the specificity is about how clear it is about what needs fixing. It's clear that prior knowledge is an issue, but it doesn't specify a particular part of the paper. So, maybe it's weakly grounded and somewhat specific because it's clear about the issue. Wait, no, the specificity is about how clear it is about what needs fixing. It's clear that prior knowledge is an issue, but it doesn't specify a particular part. So, grounding is weakly grounded, and specificity is somewhat specific. But looking at the definitions, grounding is about identifying the part, and specificity is about clarity on what's wrong. So, the comment is weakly grounded because it's not pointing to a specific part, but it's somewhat specific because it's clear about the issue. Wait, no, the comment is about the practicality of relying on prior knowledge, which is a general concern, so it's not pointing to a specific part. Therefore, grounding is weakly grounded, and specificity is somewhat specific. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check the definitions again. Grounding is about how specific the comment is about the paper. Since it's a general concern, it's weakly grounded. Specificity is about how clear it is about what needs fixing. It's clear that prior knowledge is an issue, so it's somewhat specific. But wait, the comment doesn't specify a particular part, so maybe it's not specific. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe it's weakly grounded and not specific because it's not pointing to a specific part.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The comment suggests focusing on mining causal relationships from data. It's a claim because it's suggesting a change. Now, is this claim verifiable? The comment doesn't provide evidence or reasoning to support why data mining is better. It just states the suggestion. So, it's a claim without justification, making it unverifiable. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment addresses the reviewer's concern about practicality by suggesting an alternative approach. It provides a clear suggestion, which is helpful. It's not vague; it's specific about the issue and offers a solution. So, it's highly helpful, which is a 5.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought grounding was weakly grounded and somewhat specific, but now I'm reconsidering. The comment doesn't specify a particular part, so grounding is weakly grounded. Specificity is about how clear it is about what needs fixing. The comment is clear that prior knowledge is an issue, but it doesn't specify a part. So, maybe it's weakly grounded and somewhat specific. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since it's a general concern, grounding is weakly grounded, and specificity is somewhat specific because it's clear about the issue but not about the part.\n\nWait, no, the comment is about the practicality issue in general, so it's not pointing to a specific part, so grounding is weakly grounded. Specificity is about how clear it is about what needs fixing. The comment is clear that prior knowledge is an issue, but it doesn't specify a particular part, so maybe it's somewhat specific. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since it's a general concern, maybe it's not specific at all. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nBut I think the main points are: actionability is 5, verifiability is 1, and helpfulness is 5. Grounding is weakly grounded and somewhat specific, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should go with weakly"}

The comment is explicit about the action needed\u2014splitting the tables. It doesn't ask the authors to make changes beyond this suggestion, so it's not implicit. The action is clear, and the instructions are straightforward. Therefore, this is highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The comment mentions tables 4 and 5, which are specific parts of the paper. It doesn't make vague general statements or rely on external references. The grounding is clear because it directly refers to the tables. The specificity is also good because it suggests a clear improvement without being too broad. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment about readability and suggesting a structural change. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion itself. However, the judgment is clear, so it's somewhat verifiable. There's a bit of judgment without much justification, but it's still verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment addresses a clear issue and provides a constructive suggestion.
