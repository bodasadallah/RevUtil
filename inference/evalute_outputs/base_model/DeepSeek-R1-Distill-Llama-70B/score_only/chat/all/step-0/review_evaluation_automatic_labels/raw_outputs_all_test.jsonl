It mentions that 23% of questions become invalid, with 44% due to unresolved coreference, and notes that the method rewrites only 12% of questions. The reviewer suggests that this has a minimal effect. The action here is implicit because the reviewer is pointing out a problem but not directly stating what the authors should do. However, the authors can infer that they need to improve the method's coverage or address coreference issues. The suggestion is somewhat vague because it doesn't provide specific steps on how to improve, so it's somewhat actionable but not highly.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review explicitly mentions Table 4 in the appendix and line L373, which are specific parts of the paper. This makes the grounding full. The specificity is also high because the comment clearly states the issues with the method's coverage and effectiveness, providing percentages and numbers. So, it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment includes claims about the method's effectiveness and data from the paper.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review point lists several concerns. The first is about limited novelty, suggesting that the loss functions used aren't new. It mentions specific loss functions like JS divergence, masked CE loss, and masked spherical loss. The reviewer calls it a 'plug and play' approach. Then, they point out that the attacks are only white-box and lack black-box evaluation. Lastly, they note that only untargeted attacks are considered and suggest extending to targeted ones. \n\nFor actionability, each of these points is explicit. The reviewer is directly pointing out what's wrong and suggesting specific actions. For example, they say the loss functions aren't new, which is a clear statement. They also explicitly mention the absence of black-box evaluation and suggest adding targeted attacks. So, the actions are explicit. Now, are they concrete? The suggestions are specific enough that the authors know what to do\u2014like adding black-box evaluations or including targeted attacks. So, I think this is highly actionable, so a score of 5.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like the loss functions used and the types of attacks. It refers to JS divergence, masked CE loss, etc., which are specific elements. The reviewer also talks about the attacks being white-box and the absence of black-box, which are specific aspects of the methodology. The comments are clear about what needs to be addressed, so the grounding is full and specific. Therefore, a score of 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the review makes several claims. The first is about the loss functions not being new. This is a claim that could be verified by checking existing literature. The reviewer's opinion that it's a 'plug and play' approach is subjective but is a claim. The lack of black-box evaluation and the limitation to untargeted attacks are observations that can be verified by looking at the paper's content. The reviewer doesn't provide specific references or detailed reasoning beyond their opinion, so while the claims are clear, they aren't supported by external evidence. Therefore, verifiability is somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points out major concerns that are crucial for the paper's validity. Highlighting the lack of novelty, the limitation to white-box attacks, and the need for targeted attacks are all significant points that can lead to substantial improvements.

It also mentions that the framework isn't very generalizable and might not apply to other LLMs or datasets. The reviewer is suggesting that the authors should consider generalizability. So, the action here is somewhat explicit because it points out the issue with generalizability, but it doesn't give specific steps on how to improve it. So, it's somewhat actionable but not highly. I think it's a 3 because it's explicit but vague on how to fix it.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment refers to \"mitigation strategies\" and the \"framework,\" which are specific parts of the paper. It's clear that the reviewer is talking about the methods section or where the framework is discussed. So, it's fully grounded because the authors can pinpoint where the issue is. However, the specificity is about the generalizability, which is a clear point.

It specifically mentions ACL, EMNLP, and Arxiv, which are clear and specific parts of the study. The reviewer clearly identifies the issue with the inclusion of Arxiv papers and their impact on the results. This means the comment is both fully grounded and specific, so it should be a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes several claims. The main claim is that including Arxiv papers, which aren't peer-reviewed, could bias the results. The reviewer supports this with their intuition and the common knowledge that Arxiv papers aren't peer-reviewed. However, there's no specific data or external references provided to back up the claim that Arxiv papers are of lower quality or that they caused bias in this study. The reasoning is present but not fully robust, so I'd rate this as \"Mostly Verifiable,\" which is a 4.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a potential issue with the dataset and suggests an area for improvement by providing more detailed venue distribution. However, the tone is quite negative and dismissive, especially regarding Arxiv papers. While the suggestion is useful, the harsh language might be off-putting and not as constructive as it could be.

The comment refers to \"limitations\" and \"potential negative societal impact,\" which are specific areas. However, it doesn't mention where in the paper these are addressed, like specific sections or pages. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't pinpoint exactly where these aspects are discussed.

The first part explicitly states that the notation is confusing and suggests using 'o' instead of 'c'. This is a direct and clear action, so it's explicit and concrete. The second part points out a missing reference, which is also explicit. Both parts are actionable, so I'd rate actionability as 5.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The first comment mentions Equation 1, which is a specific part of the paper, and clearly states the issue with the notation. The second part refers to Line 361 and the specific reference missing. Both are fully grounded and specific, so the score here is 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the first part is a claim that the notation is confusing. It's supported by the suggestion to change 'c' to 'o', which is logical reasoning. The second part is a factual statement about a missing reference, which doesn't require verification beyond checking the references. Since both are well-supported, verifiability is 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. Both comments provide clear and actionable feedback that directly helps the authors improve their paper.

The review point suggests that the authors should discuss the similarities and differences between their work and two other works, MEGA and Block-state Transformer, and also mentions that an ablation study should be done. This is an explicit action because it directly tells the authors what to do. It's also concrete because it specifies exactly which works to compare with and what kind of analysis (ablation) to perform. So, I think this is highly actionable, so a score of 5.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment refers to specific parts of the paper, like Figure 5 and the results section where MEGA is cited. It also mentions external works by name and provides a link to one of them. This makes the grounding full because the authors can pinpoint exactly where in their paper the issues are. The specificity is also high because it clearly states what needs to be addressed\u2014discussing similarities and differences, and conducting an ablation study. So, this should be a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes a claim that the combination of SSMs with Attention isn't new and references specific papers. It provides a link to one of them, which supports the claim. The suggestion to discuss similarities and differences is backed by logical reasoning, as comparing to existing work is a standard practice. Therefore, the claim is well-supported, so I'd rate this a 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a significant issue about the novelty of the work and provides specific references and suggestions for improvement. This is very useful for the authors to strengthen their paper by situating their work within existing literature and justifying its contributions.

So, I think this is a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment contains a claim that the hyperparameters make tuning laborious and that multiple solutions could exist. The reviewer asks for detailed discussions for reproducibility. The claim is about the difficulty of tuning, which is a judgment. The reviewer provides reasoning about why it's hard (multiple solutions, affecting FLOPs and accuracy), which is logical reasoning. There's no external reference, but the reasoning is clear.

Since it's explicit but lacks concrete steps, I think it's a 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment refers to the experiments section, mentioning the limited number of tasks (up to 20). It's clear that the experiments are the part being addressed, so the grounding is full. However, the specificity is about the number of tasks and their impact on shared parameters, which is specific. So, it's fully grounded and specific, which is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment contains a claim about the extensibility issue. The claim is supported by referencing the experiments and the number of tasks, which is a form of logical reasoning. However, it doesn't cite external references. The support is present but not extensive, so it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment identifies a clear weakness in the study's generalizability and suggests addressing it. It provides specific questions, which is helpful but could be more detailed.

It specifically mentions traditional QAT methods like LSQ, LSQ+, other LLM-based QAT work like LLM-QAT [1], and recent PTQ baselines like SpinQuant [2]. The reviewer suggests that comparing to traditional QAT, even though it's more memory expensive, would help understand the benefits of using extra memory over low-rank adapters. \n\nSo, the action here is explicit. The author is directly telling the authors to add these specific comparisons. It's not implicit; it's clear what needs to be done. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer provides specific examples of what's missing, like LSQ, LSQ+, LLM-QAT, and SpinQuant.

However, it's somewhat concrete because it mentions O(N^2) time, which is a specific measure. So, I think it's somewhat actionable but not highly so because it doesn't offer a direct solution. Maybe a 3 or 4? Wait, the action is inferred, so maybe 4 because it's concrete.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions \"Definition 2\" which is a specific part of the paper. That's full grounding. It also clearly states the issue with computational expense, so it's specific. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes a claim about computational complexity. It's supported by a common knowledge concept in computer science about time complexity, specifically O(N^2). There's no external reference, but the reasoning is clear.

It's not a direct instruction, but the authors can infer that they need to add an explanation or conduct an ablation study. However, the suggestion is somewhat vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to address it, just that it's missing. So, I think actionability is a 3 because it's explicit in pointing out the issue but vague on the exact action.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions the original GCN paper by Kipf and Welling, which is a specific reference. It also points out that the paper in question uses the original adjacency matrix without explanation. This clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed, so the grounding is full. The specificity is also high because it clearly states what's missing\u2014an explanation or ablation study. Therefore, grounding specificity should be a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes a claim that the original GCN uses a normalized matrix, which is a verifiable fact as it's a well-known part of the GCN paper. The reviewer questions the absence of explanation or ablation study, which is a claim about the current paper's methodology. The claim is supported by referencing the original work, so it's verifiable. However, the justification is based on common knowledge in the field rather than providing specific data or further references. So, I think verifiability is a 4 because it's well-supported but could be more detailed.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is very helpful because it points out a significant methodological choice that could impact the paper's validity. By highlighting the lack of explanation or ablation study, the reviewer provides clear feedback that the authors can act upon. This feedback is constructive and specific, so I'd rate helpfulness a 5.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability: 3, grounding specificity: 5, verifiability: 4, and helpfulness: 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

The comment is a question asking why a link is provided for one corpus but not the other. It's a direct question, so it's explicit. The authors can understand that they need to address the inconsistency in providing links. However, the comment doesn't suggest a specific action like adding the link or explaining the reason, so it's somewhat vague. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable, which would be a 3.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions specific corpora, WMT'15 and WMT'14, which are specific parts of the paper. This makes it fully grounded. However, the comment doesn't specify what exactly needs to be addressed beyond pointing out the inconsistency. So, it's fully grounded but not specific, which would be a 4.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a question and doesn't make a claim. It's asking for clarification, so there's no claim to verify. Therefore, it's an 'X' for verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The question points out an inconsistency which could be important for the paper's clarity and completeness.

How about experimental results on the PDBbind dataset.\" \n\nLooking at actionability, I need to see if it's explicit or implicit and concrete or vague. The first part is a statement about novelty, which is a bit vague. The second part is a suggestion to include results on the PDBbind dataset. That's a direct suggestion, so it's explicit. But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? Yes, it does\u2014use the PDBbind dataset for experiments. So, it's explicit and concrete.

It doesn't mention a specific section or part of the paper, but the suggestion is clear. So, it's fully grounded because the authors know exactly what dataset to use. The specificity is also high because it's clear what needs to be addressed\u2014adding experimental results. So, I think it's fully grounded and specific, which is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes a claim about the novelty being low and suggests using a specific dataset. The claim about techniques being used before is a judgment, so it's a claim. However, there's no evidence or reasoning provided to support why the techniques are not novel. The suggestion about the dataset is a claim as well, but it's more of a suggestion than a claim needing verification. Since the claim about novelty isn't supported, it's unverifiable, so a score of 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

That's a clear suggestion, so it's explicit. However, it doesn't provide specific steps on how to do the comparison, so it's somewhat vague. The second part is a minor comment about algorithm 1's query functions. It points out that they're the same but the framework allows them to be different.

The first part about the log likelihood function doesn't specify where in the paper this is discussed, so it's weakly grounded. The second part mentions Algorithm 1, which is a specific section, so that's fully grounded. However, the first part isn't specific about the location, so overall, it's a mix.

I think since part of it is fully grounded and specific, but the other isn't, maybe it's \"Fully Grounded and Specific\" because the second part is clear. Or perhaps it's \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because the first part isn't. I'm leaning towards \"Fully Grounded and Specific\" because the second part clearly references Algorithm 1, which is specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the first part makes a claim about truncating the log likelihood function affecting sensitivity. There's no evidence or reasoning provided, so it's a claim without support. The second part is a question about query functions, which is a normal statement without a claim. So the first part is a claim that's unverifiable, so it's a 2. But wait, the second part doesn't have a claim, so maybe the overall verifiability is \"X\" because the second part is a normal statement. But the first part has a claim without support, so it's 2. I'm a bit confused. Since the review point contains a claim, I think the verifiability is 2 because the claim isn't supported.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The first part suggests a comparison which is useful but vague. The second part provides a specific question about Algorithm 1, which is helpful.

It's pointing out that the theoretical part isn't adding much because the algorithm is already set by the labeler. So, the action here is implicit. The author would need to infer that they should improve the theoretical contribution or explain why it's limited. It's somewhat actionable because the suggestion is there, but it's not very concrete.

I think it's a 3 because it's explicit but vague on how to act.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment refers to the focus on Masked Language Models and mentions autoregressive LMs. It's specific about the models but doesn't pinpoint a particular section or part of the paper. So, it's somewhat grounded because the authors can guess the relevant section, but it's not fully grounded. I'd rate it a 3, which is fully grounded and under-specific, but wait, no.

So, I think actionability is a 3 because it's explicit in part but vague in execution.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions Figure 3 specifically, which is fully grounded. However, the contribution part doesn't reference specific sections or elements beyond the figure. So, it's fully grounded for Figure 3 but not for the contribution part. Since the main focus is on Figure 3, I'll consider it fully grounded and specific about the issue with Figure 3. So, grounding specificity is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes claims about the contribution being low. The first claim is that repair benchmarks test fault localization, which is logical reasoning. The second claim about unit tests and LLMs is also logical. Both are supported by reasoning, so verifiability is a 4 because it's well-supported but maybe could use more references.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a confusing figure and questions the contribution, providing logical arguments. This is helpful because it gives the authors specific areas to improve, even if it could be more detailed. So, I'd rate it a 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

The paper acknowledges this but doesn't address it experimentally. So, the reviewer is pointing out a limitation. Now, is this actionable? The comment suggests that the authors should address the generalizability issue experimentally. That's an explicit action, so it's explicit. But how concrete is it? The reviewer doesn't specify how to conduct those experiments, just that they should be done. So, it's somewhat actionable because the action is clear but lacks detailed steps. So, I think actionability is a 3.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment refers to the method and the paper's acknowledgment. It doesn't mention specific sections or pages, but it's clear that the method and the acknowledgment section are being discussed. So, it's fully grounded because the authors can pinpoint the method section and the part where they acknowledged the limitation. However, the comment doesn't specify exactly what needs to be addressed beyond general experimentation. So, specificity is under. Therefore, it's fully grounded but under-specific, which is a 4.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes a claim about the method's generalizability and the lack of experimental evidence. The reviewer doesn't provide any data or references to support this claim. It's based on their judgment, so it's a claim. Since there's no supporting evidence, it's unverifiable, so a score of 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a significant limitation and suggests an area for improvement. It's clear and provides a direction for the authors to enhance their paper by testing generalizability.

The reviewer is having trouble understanding how these baselines work, how they relate to InterFair, and whether they're competitive. The reviewer is pointing out a lack of clarity and suggesting that the authors need to explain these points better. So, the action here is explicit because the reviewer is directly pointing out what's missing.

The review point is pointing out a specific issue with the paper's method, specifically the use of the influence function and its limitations when weights are not close to zero. It suggests that the theoretical approximation might not hold, leading to unreliable weights. The reviewer is implying that the authors should consider this limitation. So, the action here is somewhat explicit because it's clear that the method's assumption is being questioned. However, the reviewer doesn't provide a direct suggestion on how to address this issue, like alternative methods or adjustments.

It suggests including them for a more comprehensive comparison. This is an explicit suggestion because it directly states what should be done. The action is clear: include these models. It's also concrete because the authors know exactly which models to add. So, I think this is highly actionable. So, actionability score is 5.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment refers to specific models, LLaVA-series and Qwen-VL, which are well-known. It's clear which part of the paper this addresses\u2014the evaluation section where models are compared.

It's also specific because it explains why including these models would help. So, grounding specificity is fully grounded and specific, which is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes a claim that including these models would provide a better comparison.

However, it doesn't provide specific details on how to implement it, like examples or specific datasets. So, it's somewhat actionable but not highly concrete. I think it falls under a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment doesn't mention a specific part of the paper, like a section or figure. It's a general suggestion, so the grounding is weak. However, it does specify what needs to be addressed\u2014adding captions/descriptions and OCR datasets. So, it's weakly grounded and specific, which is a 3.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion, so it's a claim. There's no supporting evidence or reasoning provided, making it unverifiable.

However, eqn.7 tells a different story.\" It directly points out a contradiction between Assumption 3.1 and equation 7. The author is clearly indicating that there's an inconsistency. This is explicit because it mentions specific parts of the paper (Assumption 3.1 and equation 7). The action here is to address the inconsistency, which is clear. So, it's explicit and concrete. Therefore, actionability should be a 5.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment explicitly mentions Assumption 3.1 and equation 7, which are specific parts of the paper. This makes it fully grounded. It also specifies the issue (contradiction), so it's specific. Therefore, grounding specificity is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment points out a contradiction between two specific parts of the paper. It doesn't provide additional reasoning or external references, but the claim is clear and based on the content of the paper. Since the claim is about the paper's internal consistency, it's verifiable through the text itself. So, I think it's mostly verifiable, maybe a 4.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment clearly identifies a critical issue that could affect the paper's validity. Pointing out a contradiction between an assumption and an equation is very useful for the authors to revise.

The comment is pointing out that something isn't clear, specifically about question 3 relating to weaknesses 2 and 4. It's asking for clarification, which is an implicit action. The authors can infer that they need to clarify question 3. However, the comment doesn't provide concrete suggestions on how to clarify, so it's somewhat vague. So, actionability would be a 3 because it's explicit in pointing out the issue but vague on how to fix it.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions \"question 3\" and \"weakness 2 and 4,\" which are specific parts of the paper. This allows the authors to pinpoint exactly where the issue is. It's fully grounded because it references specific sections. However, the specificity is about what's wrong\u2014question 3 is unclear regarding other limitations.

So, the action here is implicit because it's a question, but the suggestion is clear. The action is somewhat concrete because it points to using middle layers, but it doesn't provide specific guidance on how to implement that change. So, I think actionability is a 3 because it's somewhat actionable.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment refers to \"a number of works,\" which is a bit vague. It doesn't mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it does clearly state the issue: using last-layer vs. middle layers for probing. So, the grounding is weak because we can't pinpoint exactly where in the paper this is addressed, but the specificity is there because it clearly states the problem.

It also mentions that using GUE for determining certain aspects of the model seems arbitrary. The reviewer suggests that the model's representations might not generalize well. So, the actions here are somewhat explicit because the reviewer points out specific issues and their implications. However, the suggestions are a bit vague. The authors know what's wrong but might not know exactly how to fix it. So, I think actionability is a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but not very concrete.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions \"see my first question,\" which likely refers to a specific part of the paper. It also talks about GUE, tokenization, model architecture, etc., which are specific elements.

The reviewer is asking for more details and justification. So, the actions here are explicit because the reviewer is directly pointing out what's missing. However, the suggestions are a bit vague because they don't specify how to provide those details or what kind of justification is needed. So, it's somewhat actionable but not highly so. I think it's a 3.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment refers to specific parts of the paper: the use of hidden units and elementwise function, and handling of unobserved ratings. These are specific elements, so the grounding is full. The specificity is also high because the reviewer clearly states what's missing\u2014justification for these choices. So, it's fully grounded and specific, which is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes claims about the methodology. The reviewer states that using unobserved ratings as zeros may introduce bias. This is a claim that needs justification. The reviewer doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to support why this might introduce bias, so the claim isn't well-supported. Therefore, it's unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out specific areas that need improvement and asks for justifications, which is useful for the authors. However, it could be more helpful if it provided examples or references. So, it's mostly helpful but not highly so.

The review point mentions that the motivation is unclear and that the experiments are weak because the dataset and LLM size are limited. It suggests that the results could mislead without proper validation. So, the reviewer is pointing out specific issues but not explicitly stating what the authors should do. They don't say, for example, \"you should expand the dataset\" or \"use a larger LLM.\" So, the actions are implicit. The authors would have to infer that they need to improve the dataset size or model size. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable but not highly. I think it's a 3 because it's explicit about the problems but vague on the solutions.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review refers to the motivation and experiments, which are specific sections.

The comment is a question asking why something isn't present. It's explicit because it's directly pointing out the absence of confidence intervals in Table 3. However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't suggest what to do next. The authors know they need to address the lack of confidence intervals, but the comment doesn't provide concrete steps on how to add them or why they're important. So, it's somewhat actionable but not highly so. I think it falls under a 3 for actionability because it's explicit but lacks concrete details.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions \"Table 3\" specifically, which is a clear reference. The authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The question is about the absence of confidence intervals, which is specific. So, it's fully grounded and specific. That would be a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a question rather than a claim. It's asking for clarification, so there's no claim being made here.

It also compliments the authors on documenting their approach in Sec. A.3. Now, does this give the authors a clear action? The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue but doesn't suggest how to address it. They just state the problem and acknowledge the documentation. So, the action here is implicit because the authors might infer they need to improve segmentation or tracking, but it's not explicitly stated. Also, it's somewhat vague because the reviewer doesn't provide specific steps or solutions. So, I think actionability is a 3 because it's somewhat actionable but not very concrete.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review explicitly mentions Sec. A.3, which is a specific section. That means the grounding is full because the authors can pinpoint exactly where the approach is documented. However, the specificity is about what's wrong.

So, grounding_specificity is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes a claim that discussing traditional methods would strengthen their approach. It supports this claim with a logical reasoning that it adds academic value and provides a specific reference. The reference is a real paper, which backs up the claim.

It also details what's wrong with the figure, such as the attended areas not relating to the task and clusters without meaning. This makes it fully grounded and specific. So, the score here is 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment includes a claim that the attribution maps aren't intuitive. The reviewer provides specific examples from the figure, which serves as evidence. However, there's no external reference or further data, but the examples given are sufficient for logical reasoning. I'd rate this as mostly verifiable, so a 4.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The feedback is clear and points out specific issues with the figures, which is very useful for the authors to improve.

The first part is explicit because it directly points out the issue with the title. The second part is also explicit as it asks for empirical justification. Both are clear actions, so I think this is highly actionable. So, actionability is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions specific sections like Section 3.3 and the Introduction, which makes it fully grounded. It also specifies the issue with the term 'ROBERTA' vs. 'RoBerta', so it's specific. Therefore, grounding specificity is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes a claim about the title overclaiming. It's supported by pointing out the results are only on BERT and RoBERTa, not larger models. This provides logical reasoning, so it's verifiable. I'd rate this a 4 because it's well-supported but maybe could have more details on why larger models are necessary.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

Let me go through each aspect step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review point says the paper doesn't provide motivation for choosing date and country as spurious variables. It suggests they were chosen just because they might show spurious correlations. The reviewer also mentions \"see also below,\" which implies more discussion later. So, the action here is that the authors need to provide motivation for their variable choices. This is explicit because the reviewer directly points out the lack of motivation. However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify how to add that motivation. So, I think actionability is a 3 because it's explicit but not very concrete.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment refers to \"date and country as possible spurious correlating variables with gender.\" It doesn't mention a specific section or page, but it's clear which part of the paper is being discussed\u2014likely the methodology or variables section. So, it's fully grounded because the authors can pinpoint the area. However, the specificity is about the motivation, which is somewhat clear but could be more detailed. So, I'm leaning towards a 4 because it's fully grounded but not overly specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim that the paper lacks motivation. The reviewer provides some reasoning by mentioning that the variables were chosen just for potential spuriousness. There's no external reference, but the reasoning is logical. It's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3, because it has some justification but lacks more detailed evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review point says the authors make a point about exchanging channels, which is only achieved using BN. The reviewer questions the incremental contribution and mentions that Theorem 1's rationale is based on [38], calling it a simple fact. So, the reviewer is suggesting that the contribution isn't novel and that Theorem 1 isn't sufficiently original. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit or implicit and if it's concrete or vague. The reviewer is pointing out that the contribution isn't incremental and that Theorem 1 is based on existing work. This is an implicit action because the authors would need to infer that they should provide more novel contributions or better justify their work. However, the comment is somewhat vague because it doesn't specify exactly what the authors should do to improve. So, it's somewhat actionable but not highly so. I think a score of 3 makes sense here.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions Theorem 1 and references [38], which is a specific part of the paper. This allows the authors to pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The reviewer also specifies that the rationale is based on [38], which is a clear reference. So, the grounding is full because the authors can accurately identify the section (Theorem 1) and the reference. The specificity is also high because the comment clearly states what's wrong\u2014Theorem 1 seems like a simple fact. Therefore, this should be a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment contains a claim that Theorem 1's rationale is based on [38] and that it's a simple fact. The reviewer provides a reference ([38]) as evidence, which supports their claim. This makes the claim verifiable because it's backed by a specific source. However, the explanation is a bit brief. It could be more detailed, but it's sufficient. So, I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly verifiable with minor gaps.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a significant issue regarding the novelty of the contribution and the originality of Theorem 1. This is important feedback because it addresses the core of the paper's contribution. However, the comment could be more detailed in suggesting how the authors can improve, such as providing more context or alternative approaches. It's mostly helpful but could be expanded, so a score of 4 seems appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are actionability: 3, grounding specificity: 5, verifiability: 4, and helpfulness: 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at actionability. The review point has two parts. The first part suggests that more in-depth studies are needed to establish whether the method improves damping in second-order methods. This is a clear suggestion, so it's explicit. However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify what kind of studies or what aspects should be studied further. The second part is a question about what K denotes and whether K=NC. This is a direct question, so it's explicit as well. So, for actionability, the actions are explicit but not very concrete. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" which is a 3.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The first part refers to the method in general, which is somewhat specific but not tied to a particular section or figure. The second part mentions K first appearing in 4.1, which is a specific section. So, the second part is fully grounded because it references a specific section. The first part is more general but still clear enough. Overall, I think it's \"Fully Grounded and Specific\" because the second part is very specific, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the first part is a claim that more studies are needed. It doesn't provide any evidence or reasoning, so it's a claim without support. The second part is a question, which is a normal statement without a claim. Since the first part is a claim without justification, it's Unverifiable, so a 1. But wait, the second part is a question, which is a normal statement, so maybe the overall verifiability is X? Hmm, no, because the first part is a claim. So I think it's a 1.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The first part suggests more studies, which is helpful but a bit vague. The second part asks for clarification, which is helpful. Overall, it's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. So I think it's a 3.\n\nWait, but the verifiability part: the first part is a claim without support, so it's 1, but the second part is a question, which is X. Since the review point has both, but the first part is a claim, I think the verifiability is 1 because the claim isn't supported. Alternatively, maybe it's X because the question part doesn't have a claim. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should consider each part separately, but the instructions say to evaluate the whole review point.

The comment mentions the ablation study and Figure 2, which are specific parts of the paper. The reviewer refers to the figure and its description, so the grounding is full. However, the specificity is a bit lacking because while they point out a potential mismatch, they don't elaborate on what exactly is wrong or how to fix it.

The comment refers to the numerical evaluation and model averaging, which are specific parts of the paper. It's clear that the reviewer is talking about the methodology section or where model averaging is discussed. So, the grounding is full because the authors can pinpoint the section. However, the specificity is about the lack of explanation on how model averaging works, which is specific. So, I think it's fully grounded and specific, which is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment contains a claim that the trade-off isn't clear and questions the mechanisms. The reviewer provides their understanding but doesn't cite any external references or logical reasoning beyond their own understanding. So, the claim is there but not well-supported, making it somewhat verifiable. I think it's a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a significant issue with the paper's clarity on a key concept. It suggests that the authors need to explain the mechanisms better, which is a clear area for improvement.

{"generated_text": "Alright, I need to evaluate the given review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, for actionability. The review has three minor comments. Each one is explicit because they directly state what needs to be done. For example, (a) suggests that a paragraph is too long and affects readability, so the action is to make it shorter. (b) asks for more details on experiments, so the action is to add more. (c) suggests using more pages for important figures and tables. Each action is clear and direct, so they are explicit. Now, are they concrete? Each point tells the authors exactly what to do, so they are concrete. Therefore, actionability is highly actionable, which is a 5.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. Each comment refers to specific sections or parts of the paper. (a) mentions Section 1 and a specific paragraph about Co-variance. (b) talks about experiments on long-tailed datasets, which is a specific part of the paper. (c) refers to tables and figures, which are specific elements. Each comment is fully grounded because the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is.

The comments are more about suggestions rather than claims. For example, stating that a paragraph is long is a subjective opinion, which is a claim. However, the reasoning provided is that it reduces legibility, which is a logical explanation. Similarly, suggesting more experiments is backed by the importance of affirming the paper's contribution, which is a logical argument. Each claim is supported with reasoning, so they are verifiable. Since each claim is well-supported, verifiability is a 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. Each comment provides clear and actionable feedback.

I'd rate this a 4 because it's mostly helpful but could be more detailed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scores are actionability: 3, grounding specificity: 5, verifiability: 2, and helpfulness: 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"2\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the given aspects: actionability, grounding specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each aspect step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review point says that the experimental validation only uses CIFAR-10/100 as in-distribution data and questions whether the conclusions generalize. It suggests that the authors should consider other datasets. This is an explicit suggestion because it directly points out a limitation and implies an action\u2014testing on other datasets. However, it doesn't provide specific instructions on which datasets to use or how to implement the tests, so it's somewhat vague. Therefore, it's somewhat actionable, which would be a 3.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions CIFAR-10/100, which is a specific part of the paper's experimental section. This allows the authors to pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The comment is specific about the concern regarding generalization. So, it's fully grounded and specific, which is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim suggesting a potential weakness. It's supported by the fact that using only one dataset might not show generalizability, which is a logical reasoning. However, it doesn't cite any external references or provide specific examples beyond CIFAR. So, it's somewhat verifiable, maybe a 3.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment points out a valid concern about generalization, which is important for the paper's validity. It's clear and provides a direction for improvement, so it's mostly helpful, but not fully detailed. I'd rate it a 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the given aspects: actionability, grounding specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review point says, \"In Table 8, it seems that AlphaNets trained with alpha-divergence doesn\u2019t benefit from your method. Maybe you should show the gradient conflicts ratio for it to give some insights.\" The action here is explicit because the reviewer is directly suggesting to show the gradient conflicts ratio. It's also concrete because they specify what to show, so the authors know exactly what to do. So, actionability should be a 5.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment mentions \"Table 8,\" which is a specific part of the paper. This makes the grounding full. The specificity is also high because they point out that AlphaNets with alpha-divergence don't benefit and suggest adding gradient conflicts ratio. So, it's fully grounded and specific, which is a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment makes a claim that AlphaNets don't benefit from the method. However, the reviewer doesn't provide any data or references to support this claim. They just state it and suggest an action. So, the claim isn't really supported, making verifiability low. I think it's a 1 because there's no evidence or reasoning given.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a specific issue in the results and suggesting a way to provide more insight. This is useful for the authors to improve their paper by adding necessary analysis. So, it's highly helpful, which is a 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the given aspects: actionability, grounding specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each aspect step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review point is pointing out that the use of explicit SDF supervision with occlusion handling and view-aware methods isn't clear. The reviewer suggests an alternative approach of sampling a subset of the sparse point cloud and applying the loss on the 3D location without occlusion reasoning. They also mention that a good reason or ablation study is missing. \n\nSo, the actionability here is explicit because the reviewer is directly suggesting an alternative method. They're not just pointing out a problem but offering a specific solution. The suggestion is concrete because they explain how to implement it: sampling a subset and applying the loss without occlusion handling. So, this should be highly actionable. I think the score here is 5.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions specific sections (Sec. 3.2) and lines (L. 165, 173, 177-178). This makes it fully grounded because the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is. The specificity is also high because the reviewer explains what's unclear and suggests an alternative approach. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment contains a claim that the current method is unclear and suggests an alternative. The reviewer provides logical reasoning by explaining why their suggested method is simpler and more straightforward. However, there's no external reference or data to support the claim that the alternative is better. So, the claim is somewhat justified with reasoning but lacks external evidence. I think this is a 4.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is very helpful because it identifies a specific issue, explains why it's a problem, and offers a clear alternative solution. It also suggests an ablation study, which is a constructive suggestion. This provides the authors with clear guidance on how to improve. So, this should be a 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"4\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}
