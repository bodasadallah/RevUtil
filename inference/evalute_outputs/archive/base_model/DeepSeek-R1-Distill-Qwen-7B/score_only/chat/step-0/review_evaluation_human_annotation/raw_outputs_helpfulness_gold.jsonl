The reviewer is asking why the chosen options (OR and MIN) were better. The comment is suggesting an implicit action\u2014implying the author should have considered AND and max. However, it doesn't specify how to apply this, like suggesting alternative methods or providing examples. So, it's explicit in pointing out a potential improvement but lacks detail on how to do it. That makes it **Borderline Actionable** because it's clear the author should consider something, but the action isn't fully detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to specific operators (AND, OR, MIN, MAX) and their corresponding set operations (union and intersection). It's clear and directly mentions these elements, so the grounding is strong. The specificity is also high because it explains the operators and their relevance, making it clear what needs to be addressed. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting that considering AND and max would be better. It doesn't provide any justification or references, so there's no supporting evidence.

Is this explicit? Yes, they're stating what needs to be done. But is it concrete? They don't specify how to compare or what results to expect. So it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 for Actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review points out specific papers and sections the author should compare with. It accurately mentions Campos et al. and Section 8. So the grounding is full because they're pinning down exactly where the comparisons should be. That's a 5.\n\nVerifiability. The review makes a claim that the baseline models are weak and suggests comparisons. It provides references like Campos et al. (2020) and Section 8.

The explicitness is high because it directly tells the authors what to do. The specificity is also good because it mentions exact elements like the model and figure. So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review clearly references specific parts of the paper (section 2.3, Figure 3) and mentions external work (Lample et al.), which grounds it well. It also specifies what needs to be addressed, so this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment provides references and logical reasoning. It cites Lample et al. and explains the relevance of word embeddings, which are common knowledge. This makes the claim verifiable, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

First, the pooling method for embeddings on line 397, and second, clarifying equation (7) on line 472. It explicitly tells the authors what needs to be done, which is good. However, it doesn't provide specific instructions on how to implement these changes. For example, it doesn't say whether to use mean, max, or another pooling method. So, while the action is clear, the detail is lacking. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points to specific sections, line 397 and equation (7). It mentions the pooling method and the equation, which are specific parts of the paper. Additionally, it explains what needs to be clarified about the equation, which is about whether E_i refers to type or identity. This shows that the reviewer has identified specific areas and issues within those areas, so the grounding is strong here.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The review makes claims about the pooling method and the equation. For the pooling method, it's a straightforward suggestion, which is clear. For the equation, it's pointing out that the left-hand side should be a conditional probability, which is a valid claim. The reviewer doesn't reference external literature or provide examples, but the claims are logically sound and based on common knowledge. So, this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions for both the pooling method and the equation. It's not vague; it directly points out specific areas that need improvement. The feedback is actionable and addresses both issues mentioned. Therefore, it's highly helpful as it guides the authors on exactly what to change and why.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable because it's clear but lacks specific implementation details.

However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement the changes, like suggesting a particular structure for the table. So, it's explicit but not very detailed. I think this falls under **Somewhat Actionable** because the action is clear, but the implementation isn't fully spelled out.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions the semi-supervised version of the method and suggests renaming a column. It accurately points out the specific part of the paper (Table 1) and clearly explains what needs to be addressed. There's no ambiguity here, so this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests renaming a column and proposes a more detailed table structure. While it provides some justification by explaining the benefits of the proposed changes, it doesn't cite any external references or logical reasoning beyond the suggestion itself. So, it's somewhat supported but lacks depth. I'd rate this as **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review offers clear suggestions about renaming a column and improving the table structure. These are directly actionable for the authors, providing them with specific steps to improve their work. This makes the comment quite helpful. I think it deserves a **5: Highly Helpful** score because it's clear, actionable, and directly addresses the authors' needs.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: Somewhat Actionable (3)\n- Grounding Specificity: Fully Grounded and Specific (5)\n- Verifiability: Somewhat Verifiable (3)\n- Helpfulness: Highly Helpful (5)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Somewhat Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Highly Helpful\"\n}\n```"}

It also asks for clarification on random data. The actions seem clear\u2014run experiments and clarify details. But are these actions explicit? Yes, they state what needs to be done. Are they concrete? The review specifies adding experiments and clarifying points, so the actions are explicit and concrete. Therefore, this should be **5: Highly Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review refers to Figure 3c and Figure 3, asking for clarification. It mentions random data and normalization. The references are specific to the figures and sections, so the grounding is clear. It also provides specific questions about the data, which makes it grounded. Therefore, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes claims about the experiments needing to be run and the data's normalization. These claims are supported by logical reasoning\u2014asking for experiments to validate results and clarifying data handling. There's no mention of external references or common knowledge, but the logical reasoning is present. So, this should be **4: Mostly Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review provides clear suggestions for experiments and data clarification, which directly helps the authors improve their work.

It also suggests comparing with other methods like Ulyanov's work. The comment is explicit about suggesting a comparison, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify exactly how to implement this comparison, like whether it should be a separate section or how to present the results. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to Ulyanov's work, which is a specific external reference. It also suggests placing the current method in context, which is a clear indication of the part of the paper being addressed. So, it's fully grounded because it mentions a specific section or aspect of the paper.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting a comparison with other methods.

The action here is clear: the authors should expand their experiments. It's explicit because it tells them exactly what to do. Also, it's concrete because it specifies real data. So this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions toy data and real data. It doesn't explicitly name sections or tables, but it's clear which part they're talking about.

The review says, \"the evaluation is weak; the baselines used in the paper are not even designed for fair classification.\" It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a problem with the evaluation methods. Now, looking at the definition of actionability, it's about whether the review gives clear instructions on what to do. This comment is suggesting that the baselines are inadequate, but it doesn't specify how to fix it. It's more of an implicit comment. So, it's not explicit, which would have been better. Therefore, it's not highly actionable because it doesn't provide concrete steps. It's probably a 3 on the actionability scale since it's somewhat actionable but vague.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment talks about baselines not being designed for fair classification. It doesn't mention any specific part of the paper or the issue in question. So, the grounding is weak because the reviewer can't pinpoint where the problem lies. They're making a general statement, which means the grounding is weakly grounded and not specific. So, this would be a 2 on the grounding_specificity scale.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim that the baselines are weak and not designed for fair classification. Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is stating an opinion about the baselines, but without any supporting evidence or references, it's hard to verify. There's no justification or examples provided. So, it's borderline verifiable because there's some support but it's vague. That would be a 2 on the verifiability scale.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is pointing out a flaw in the evaluation methods but doesn't provide specific suggestions on how to improve the baselines or how to conduct fair classification. It's a general critique without actionable steps. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth.

I think this would be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest something but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to specific works and methods, which is good because it points to particular areas. But the references are a bit vague, just mentioning ADMM and SGD without specifics. It doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper is being discussed. So, I'd rate this as **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does mention specific parts but doesn't clearly explain what needs fixing.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the Walkman algorithm isn't accurately described as using SGD.

Therefore, this is **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions line 8 of algorithm 1 and suggests a change. It accurately references the specific part of the paper, so grounding is strong. The suggestion is specific about the change, so specificity is also good. This makes it **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a claim by suggesting a change and asking for additional data. It provides a logical reasoning for why s_n might be better and references an external link for more information. This is thorough and well-supported, so it's **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out a specific issue and provides clear suggestions. It's asking for more detailed results, which is helpful for the authors to improve their work. The feedback is clear and directly addresses the concerns, so it's **Highly Helpful**.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Fully Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Fully Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Highly Helpful\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, actionability. The review says, \"I would tone down this statement, in my understanding, the neural network does not memorize an exact 'critical point' as such in TopoNet [24].\" The author is suggesting a change to a statement about neural networks not memorizing critical points. That's an explicit action. Then, they mention minor issues with the method section being wordy and suggest compressing it. They also point out grammatical errors, like pluralization and articles. So, the author is providing clear instructions on how to improve the paper. That seems actionable and concrete. So, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review mentions \"the neural network does not memorize an exact 'critical point' as such in TopoNet [24].\" The author is specifically addressing a part of the paper, referencing a specific work. That's full grounding because they're pointing to a specific section and providing a reference. They also mention grammatical errors, which are specific issues in the method section. So, the grounding is solid here. I'd give this a 5 for grounding specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the review contains a claim that the neural network doesn't memorize critical points, which is a judgment. The author supports this with a reference to TopoNet [24], which is an external source. That makes the claim verifiable. They also suggest improvements in the method section, which is a clear recommendation. So, the verifiability is high. I'll score this a 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review provides clear feedback on a specific point, suggests improvements in the method section, and points out grammatical errors. It's concise and actionable, which is very helpful for the authors. There's no indication that it's lacking in helpfulness, so a 5 here makes sense.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says that comparing with Megatron is overrated and mentions other models like RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and DeBERTa. It suggests that if COCO-LM is parameter-efficient, the conclusion applies to these others. The reviewer then asks about switching BPE types. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions. The reviewer is pointing out that the comparison is overrated and lists other models. They also ask a question about BPE types. The explicit action here is pointing out the overrating and suggesting the conclusion applies to others. The question is about the experimental setup, which is a specific action. However, the advice given is somewhat vague because it doesn't tell the authors exactly how to modify their setup or what changes to make. It's more of a suggestion rather than a clear instruction. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it does give an action but doesn't specify exactly how to apply it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer talks about other models and BPE types. They mention specific models like RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and DeBERTa, which is good because it clearly identifies the referenced parts. However, when they ask about the BPE types, they don't specify whether it's a general question or ask for a particular reason. It's a bit vague about why they switched BPE types. So, the grounding is good because they mention specific models, but the specificity in explaining the BPE change is lacking. Therefore, this should be **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because they can identify the models but don't clearly explain what's needed for the BPE change.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer makes a claim by stating that comparing with Megatron is overrated and that the conclusion applies to other models. They also ask a question about the BPE types. The claim is supported by mentioning other models, which is a form of justification. The reasoning is clear, and they reference existing models, so this is **Somewhat Verifiable** because they provide some support but could be more detailed.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer provides some critique about the comparison being overrated and suggests that the parameter efficiency applies to other models. They also ask a question about the experimental setup. While this gives the authors some feedback, it's somewhat vague and doesn't provide detailed suggestions on how to improve their work. The questions are open-ended and might not address all potential issues. So, this is **Somewhat Helpful** because it does offer some feedback but isn't as comprehensive or specific as it could be.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores should reflect these evaluations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Somewhat Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Somewhat Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review suggests that the analysis from lines 128 to 149 isn't convincing enough. It mentions that the GS-P-50 model has a smaller class selectivity score, implying ResNet-50 learns more class-specific features. The authors hypothesize that additional context could reduce dependency. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out an observation but doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They suggest looking into class selectivity and how adding context might help. So, it's more of an inference rather than a direct action. Therefore, it's **Implicit** and vague because the authors still need to figure out the next steps themselves. So, on the actionability scale, it's probably a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it does suggest an action but doesn't tell exactly how.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer refers to lines 128-149, which is specific, so that's good. They also mention class selectivity scores and ResNet-50, which are specific parts of the paper. They also reference external papers, which adds credibility. So, the grounding is pretty solid here. It's **Fully Grounded and Specific**, so a **5** on that scale.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer makes a claim that the analysis isn't convincing enough. They provide some reasoning about class selectivity and the hypothesis about additional context. They also reference external literature, which supports their claim. This seems pretty well-justified, so it's **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer points out a specific area for improvement and provides some reasoning and references. However, the suggestion is a bit vague about what exactly the authors should do next. They don't give explicit steps or detailed explanations beyond the references. So, while it's helpful, it's not the most detailed. Maybe a **4: Mostly Helpful** because it does suggest improvements but could be more comprehensive.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 5\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It suggests that authors should consider these dependencies when implementing their design decisions. This is explicit, so it's not implicit. However, the comment doesn't specify how to apply this in different contexts, making it somewhat vague. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors don't know exactly how to modify their work. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to hardware and software dependencies but doesn't specify which parts of the paper or unique aspects it's addressing.

It says \"define,\" which is pretty direct. So, the authors know exactly what to do. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it's not just asking for an explanation but actually to define specific elements in the figures. So, this should be highly actionable. I think that's a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is pointing to specific figures (2A-B and 4B). So, the authors can accurately pinpoint where to focus. It's not just a vague statement about the figures but specifically mentions them. Therefore, this has full grounding because it clearly identifies the parts of the paper being addressed.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. The comment is a request for clarification, which is a normal statement. There's no claim being made here; it's just asking for an explanation.

It also questions the meaning of \u03c3 and suggests it might be a sigmoid activation. These are explicit actions, so it's actionable. The explanation is clear, so it's not vague. Therefore, it's **4: Mostly Actionable**.\n\nFor **Grounding Specificity**, the reviewer clearly references Section 4.2 and points out specific issues in the equation.

This part isn't clear on how to apply the suggestions, making it only partially actionable. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions Fig 3 and asks about the correspondence between learning curves and M-PHATE. It's clear which figure is being referred to, so that's fully grounded. However, the questions about model performance and accuracy are vague and don't specify exactly what to look for, like exact accuracy numbers or which task's performance. So, it's only weakly specific, giving it a 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the claim here is that the author should look at the learning curves and explain the correspondence.

It suggests that the contribution is unclear. \n\nFor actionability, I need to check if the comment is explicit and concrete. The review does state that the findings are not novel, which is explicit. However, it doesn't specify exactly what the authors should do next. They might need to elaborate on their contribution or compare their method with existing ones. Since the action is not fully detailed, it's somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to previous works and mentions \"extremely simplified settings.\" It specifically points out that the findings have been reported before. This means the comment accurately identifies the part of the paper being addressed and clearly specifies the issue. So, this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a score of 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the paper's contribution is unclear due to simplified settings. It supports this with references to previous works and mentions that similar findings exist. The justification is provided through citations and logical reasoning, making it fully verifiable.

The comment is explicit about the need for clarification, so that's an explicit action. It also provides a concrete direction on what to add, so it's actionable. Therefore, this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions Figure 3 and specifically asks about the role of EEG sensors.

It's explicit because it tells the authors exactly where to add content. But is it concrete? It mentions the citation, which is good, but it doesn't specify exactly how to implement moment matching or provide examples. So, it's explicit but not very concrete. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks detailed guidance.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review mentions a specific paper (Nguyen-Tang et al., AAAI\u201921) and clearly states what alternative they're suggesting (moment matching instead of quantile regression). This means the comment is fully grounded because it points to a specific part of the literature. It also specifies the issue, which is the use of quantile regression.

Is this an explicit action? Well, it's a question, so the author needs to provide more information. It's explicit in the sense that it's a direct request, but it's not giving a specific action like \"add a figure\" or \"modify section X.\" So, it's more of an implicit action because the author has to infer what needs to be done. Therefore, it's not fully actionable. Maybe a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is asking about the origin of dataset labels. The author needs to identify which part of the paper they're referring to. Since it's a specific part, like dataset 4.1, the grounding is pretty clear. They can pinpoint exactly where the labels come from. So, this has full grounding because it's specific and explicit about the dataset. The specificity is also high because it's asking for the source, which is a clear issue in the paper.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says the paper is well-organized and the writing is good. It then lists weaknesses and feedback, suggesting to add a table comparing CoT prompting methods and asking about assumptions and selection criteria. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the suggestions are explicit and concrete. The reviewer is asking for a table, which is a clear action. However, the questions about assumptions and selection criteria are more open-ended. They don't specify how to choose the token and rationale limits. So, while the action is explicit (adding a table), the details are vague. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions specific areas for improvement\u2014comparing CoT methods and questions/rationales. They also ask about assumptions and selection criteria, which are specific parts of the paper. The mention of section 4.2 is explicit, so the grounding is clear. The specificity is good because they're asking about particular sections and rationales. So, this should be **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making claims about the writing being good and suggesting improvements. The claims are supported by the fact that the paper is well-organized and the writing is good. The suggestions are based on common knowledge about improving writing and comparing methods, which are verifiable. The reasoning is clear, and there's no need for external references. So, this is **5: Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer provides specific suggestions for improvement, like adding a table and clarifying assumptions. These are actionable and directly address the paper's content. The questions are clear and would help the authors improve their work. So, this is **5: Highly Helpful**.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The action is somewhat actionable because it's explicit but lacks detail.

But it doesn't tell them exactly what to do next. So, it's explicit but not concrete. That makes it borderline actionable because the action is clear, but the details are missing. So, I'd give it a 3.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review points out a specific part of the paper, like the comparison between different models at line 486. It also mentions FeedME-2 and PPO, which are specific references. So, it's fully grounded because it clearly identifies the sections being discussed. The specificity is good because it explains what needs improvement. So, this should be a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests that the authors should perform significance testing. It doesn't provide any external references or logical reasoning, just a request for testing.

It sounds like the reviewer is suggesting a method to calculate results but isn't telling the authors exactly what to do. So, it's implicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer isn't giving specific steps on how to average the runs. They just mention the method. So, it's vague. That would make it borderline actionable because it's implicit but lacks detail.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The comment doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It's just a general suggestion about statistical significance. There's no reference to a section, table, or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the reviewer can't pinpoint where the issue lies. It's not grounded at all.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a claim by suggesting averaging results over multiple runs. Is this claim supported? Well, it's a general statistical advice, which is common knowledge. There's no external reference, but it's a logical suggestion based on standard practices. So, it's somewhat verifiable because it's supported by common knowledge, even if there's no specific reference.\n\nLastly, helpfulness.

It's vague about where the figures are or how equations connect. So the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the issue clearly.

For actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The first part about adding a reference is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do. The second part about \u03a9 not being defined is also explicit because it clearly states that a definition is missing. Since both parts are direct and provide clear instructions, this should be highly actionable. So, I think it's a 5.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment talks about adding a reference next to baseline names, which is specific because it tells exactly where to place the citation. It also mentions \u03a9 in Corollary 1, which is specific because it refers to a particular part of the paper. Therefore, the grounding is strong because it accurately points to the sections being addressed. I'd give this a 5.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment suggests adding a reference, which is a claim because it's a suggestion. It doesn't provide any external references or justification, so it's not verifiable. The only support is the suggestion itself, which doesn't back up the recommendation. So, this should be unverifiable, which is a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is clear about two issues: adding a reference and defining \u03a9. It provides specific suggestions without being vague. The feedback is actionable and directly addresses the author's needs.

The comment is explicit about the change, so that's clear. It doesn't ask the authors to do anything beyond correcting the caption, so it's not implicit. It's also specific about the change, so it's not vague.

The comment mentions Figure 7, which is a specific part of the paper. It's not just a vague reference but clearly points to the figure. The comment also specifies that the caption should be changed to \"Edge Dynamics\", so it's clear what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that the caption is incorrect and should be changed.

But does it tell the authors exactly what to do? It says \"could be convincing\" and mentions an example, but it's more of an opinion than a clear action. So, it's explicit but not concrete. I think this is **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear that case studies should be discussed but doesn't specify how to implement it beyond the example given.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions specific papers and an example, so it clearly references a unique element. It doesn't just say \"discuss case studies\" but provides a specific example, which makes it grounded. I think this is **5: Fully Grounded and Specific** because it accurately points to the paper and provides a concrete example.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim by suggesting case studies improve convincingness.

However, the explanation is vague because it doesn't provide specifics on why the improvement is well-known or how much detail is actually needed. So, it's not fully actionable but gives a clear direction.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment refers to \"kernels\" and mentions OpenAI's Triton. It doesn't explicitly name the section or page where the implementation is detailed. The grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing the exact part of the paper being discussed. However, it does imply that the implementation is in the kernels, which is specific enough.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review states that the change is due to well-known engineering improvements. It's making a claim that the improvement is well-known, but it doesn't provide any references or examples to support this. The justification is vague, so the verifiability is low.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment explains why OpenAI's Triton is used and suggests that a full-page explanation isn't necessary. This provides clear feedback to the authors, helping them understand the implementation choice and the reason behind it. It's somewhat helpful but could be more detailed. So, it's a 4 out of 5.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3 (Somewhat actionable)\n- Grounding Specificity: 2 (Weakly grounded and specific)\n- Verifiability: 1 (Unverifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 4 (Mostly Helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"2\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"1\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

The reviewer is pointing out a missing comparison, which is an action the authors should take. But the advice is vague because it doesn't specify how to compare or what data to use. So it's implicit. Since it's not explicit, the actionability isn't clear.

So I think this is highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review mentions \"additional experiments in the supplement.\" That's specific because it refers to a particular part of the paper, even though it's in the supplement. It's not vague or too general, so grounding is solid here.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a claim because it suggests adding a summary. It's supported by the idea that readers might want to know the supplement's content. The reasoning is logical, and there's no need for external references here. So it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is clear and directly points out an improvement area. It doesn't seem vague or unclear. So it's highly helpful because it gives a specific and actionable suggestion.\n\nI don't see any borderline cases here. Each aspect seems to fit neatly into the higher scores.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"5\"\n}\n```"}

It's explicit about the references and provides a clear action, which is to compare with GFF and EfficientFCN. The action is explicit, so it's not implicit. Now, is it concrete? The suggestion is to compare, but it doesn't specify how to do that. For example, it doesn't mention whether they should add a section, modify the methodology, or what exactly to include in the comparison. So, it's explicit but not concrete. Therefore, this should be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specifics on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The review refers to GFF and EfficientFCN by their citations, which is a good start. It mentions that both aim for fast semantic segmentation in encode-decoder architectures, which grounds the references in specific aspects of the paper. Additionally, it suggests a comprehensive comparison, which is specific to the methods. So, the grounding is strong because it accurately references the sections and provides clear guidance on what to compare. Therefore, this should be a **5: Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that important references are missing and suggests a comparison. The claim is supported by pointing out that both GFF and EfficientFCN are relevant and that the societal impact is on the last page. The reasoning is clear, and the references are specific. There's no mention of needing external verification beyond what's already provided. So, this should be **5: Fully Verifiable** because the evidence is strong and logical.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is encouraging the authors to add references and make a comparison. It's clear and provides actionable advice. However, it doesn't specify what exactly to add or how the comparison should be structured. While it's helpful, it could be more detailed. So, this should be a **4: Mostly Helpful** because it offers useful feedback but could be expanded for clarity and depth.\n\nPutting it all together, the scores are:\n- Actionability: 3\n- Grounding Specificity: 5\n- Verifiability: 5\n- Helpfulness: 4\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_label\": \"3\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"5\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"4\"\n}\n```"}

It also suggests that the algorithm might fail in practice and calls for experimental results. \n\nLooking at the criteria, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The review explicitly states the issue with the Vandermonde matrix, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't provide specific steps on how to fix it or what changes to make. It just suggests experiments, which is somewhat vague. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but lacks concrete details on implementation.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to Algorithm 1 by name and mentions its specific properties like being ill-conditioned. It also suggests experiments, which are specific to the algorithm. The grounding is strong because it clearly points to Algorithm 1 and the issue with its numerical stability. So, this should be **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review contains a claim that Algorithm 1 might fail due to numerical instability. It supports this claim by citing the properties of the Vandermonde matrix and the range of \u03b1. The reasoning is logical, and it references well-known numerical issues, so it's thoroughly justified. Therefore, this is **Fully Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review addresses a valid concern about the algorithm's practical performance and suggests experiments. It provides clear feedback and is actionable, though it doesn't offer specific fixes.

It also questions if FMN can scale with more filter parameters. The suggestions are explicit: ask about other architectures and scalability. However, the review doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next. For example, it doesn't specify whether to look into ResNets or Transformers or provide any guidance on scaling. So, it's explicit in pointing out the issues but lacks concrete steps.

However, it doesn't provide clear instructions on how to implement these changes. For example, it says \"fonts could be larger\" but doesn't specify how much larger or where to adjust the settings. Similarly, it mentions the size of certain variables but doesn't give actionable steps. So, while there are suggestions, they're not explicit or concrete. This makes the actionability somewhat unclear. I think this falls under \"Somewhat Actionable\" because it does explicitly state actions but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review refers to specific figures and mentions details like font sizes and variable sizes. It doesn't explicitly name sections or tables, but it does point out particular elements in the figures. The specificity about the issues is clear, like the size of V_mem, etc. However, since it's not directly naming the sections, maybe it's only \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" because it can make an educated guess but isn't precise.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes claims about font sizes and the need for a \"CTRL\" explanation.

It seems like the reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a specific action. So, it's implicit. Now, is it concrete or vague?

The reviewer is asking for a comment on the computation requirements of the three methods in Table 1.\n\nIs this actionable? Well, the reviewer is asking for a comparison of computation requirements, which is a clear action. However, the suggestion is quite vague. They mention KVAE's simplicity but don't specify how it compares to DMM and DVBF in terms of computation. So, while the action is explicit, the details are lacking. This makes it somewhat vague.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review points out that the first quotation mark around \"in-between\" should be a forward quote. It's explicit because it directly states the correction needed. It also gives a clear action: replacing the backward quote with a forward one. So, it's both explicit and concrete. That should score a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The review mentions the specific phrase \"in-between\" and clearly states what's wrong with the quotation mark. It doesn't make any general comments or guesses, so it's fully grounded. The specificity is high because it directly addresses the issue in the text. So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a suggestion to change the quotation mark. There's no claim here; it's just a descriptive correction. So, it doesn't require any justification or evidence. It's a factual statement, so it's not verifiable. I think this should be an X since there's no claim.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is pointing out a specific formatting issue. It's clear and directly tells the author what needs to be changed. It's helpful because it's straightforward and gives a clear instruction. So, it should be a 5 for helpfulness.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect is either 5 or X.

But it doesn't specify how or where to explore it. It's vague on the implementation. So, it's an implicit action but not concrete. That would make it borderline actionable because it does suggest an action but doesn't detail how to apply it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment mentions \"the new proposed dataset, DRRI\" but doesn't specify where in the paper it should be explored. It's not pointing to a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because the authors can't confidently identify the referenced part. It's not fully grounded since it's not clearly pointing to a specific area.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment that the dataset could have been explored more. It's a claim because it's an opinion or suggestion. Now, is this claim supported? The comment doesn't provide any justification or references. It's just a statement of opinion without backing. So, it's unverifiable because there's no supporting evidence.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment suggests exploring the dataset more but doesn't specify how. It's vague and lacks concrete suggestions. So, it's not very helpful.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says, \"Please use more objective terms than remarkable: 'and remarkable accuracy improvement with same size of networks'.\" The action here is clear: the reviewer is asking the author to replace \"remarkable\" with more objective terms. It's explicit, so that's good. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't just say to use more objective terms; they also specify replacing \"remarkable\" with something else. So, the action is explicit and concrete. I think this should be a 5 for actionability.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the paper\u2014the axes being squished and the improvement being difficult to characterize as remarkable. They mention the axes and the network size, which are specific elements. The grounding is clear because they're referring to the axes and the network size, which are specific parts of the paper. The specificity is also good because they're explaining why the term \"remarkable\" is problematic. So, this should be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a suggestion to use more objective terms. There's no claim here; it's just a suggestion. So, according to the definitions, this falls under \"X\" because there's no claim, only a descriptive statement. Therefore, verifiability is 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is giving a clear and specific instruction to the author. They're asking to replace a term with more objective language, which is directly helpful.

It's explicit about the improvement being modest, which is a clear action. However, it doesn't specify how to achieve this or what changes are needed. So, it's explicit but lacks concrete details. That makes it **Somewhat Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions performance enhancements but doesn't specify which part of the paper or what exactly needs improvement. It's vague about the specific area or issue. Therefore, the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint the referenced part. So, it's **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review claims that the observed performance is modest, which is a subjective judgment. There's no supporting evidence or justification provided. So, it's a claim without any backing, making it **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review points out that improvements are modest and suggests further refinement.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review point is asking for references for two specific passages and explaining what \"MLP\" is. For the first part, it's clear what needs to be done\u2014provide references. But references are often cited in the paper itself, so the reviewer isn't asking the authors to do any changes beyond that. They're just pointing out that the current references aren't cited. That's a bit vague because the authors might already know that. Also, the second part about explaining \"MLP\" is a bit vague too. The reviewer isn't specifying how the authors should explain it or where to look. So, this is more of an implicit action without clear instructions. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because the action is there but not very detailed.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer is pointing out specific sections of the paper (lines 230-234 and 234-235) and a figure (Figure 2). They're asking for references in those sections and an explanation of \"MLP.\" Since they're explicitly naming the sections and figure, that's full grounding. However, when it comes to explaining \"MLP,\" the reviewer isn't specifying where in the paper that should be discussed or providing any context. So, while the section is grounded, the specificity regarding the MLP explanation is weak because it's not detailed.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is making claims by suggesting that the framework is applied to summarization tasks and that MLP isn't described. For the first claim about summarization, the reviewer is citing previous works, which is a valid external reference. That makes the claim somewhat verifiable. For the second claim about MLP not being described, the reviewer isn't providing any evidence or references. They're just stating that it's not described, which isn't supported by anything. So, this part is unverifiable because there's no justification or references backing up the claim that MLP isn't described.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The review is asking for references and an explanation of MLP. References are standard and often expected, so that part is somewhat helpful. However, the explanation of MLP is vague and doesn't provide actionable steps for the authors. They just want an explanation without specifying how or where. This makes the helpfulness somewhat limited because while references are useful, the MLP part isn't very helpful without more detail.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the definitions provided.

It says that the patches are masked versions with most pixels black, which might be misleading. The reviewer suggests using bilinear sampling for zooming. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer does mention an action: suggesting bilinear sampling. But does it tell the authors exactly how to implement it? It just says \"use bilinear sampling,\" which is vague about where or how to apply it. So, it's not fully actionable. It's more of an implication, so maybe it's borderline actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer refers to equation 9 and Figure 1. They mention that the patches are masked versions, which is specific. They also suggest an alternative method, which is another point of grounding. So, the grounding is clear and specific. They aren't just guessing; they accurately point to the parts of the paper and suggest a specific improvement. That seems fully grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**: The reviewer is making a claim here by pointing out the discrepancy and suggesting a different method. They provide a reasoning that using bilinear sampling would be better, which is logical. They aren't citing external references, but the reasoning is clear and logical. So, it's somewhat verifiable because they explain why the suggestion is good, even without external sources.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer's comment is clear and directly addresses a potential issue in the paper. They suggest a specific improvement, which is helpful. While it's not exhaustive, it provides meaningful feedback that could guide the authors on where to focus their edits.

It mentions revisiting the Discussion but says it's fine to delete that part. The action here is suggesting deletion, which is explicit. However, it doesn't provide concrete steps on how to delete or where exactly to make the change. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity.

That gives a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is making a judgment about the Discussion section and providing a reason. The reason is based on gradients being computed for early layers, which is a logical explanation. It cites specific parts of the paper, so it's well-supported.

The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue, so that's clear. Now, is it concrete? Yes, because it tells the authors exactly where to look (Figure 6) and what the problem is (font size too small). So it's not just a suggestion but a direct action. Therefore, it's highly actionable.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to Figure 6, which is specific. The reviewer is pointing out a particular part of the paper, so the grounding is strong. It's not a vague comment about the figure in general but specifically about Figure 6. Therefore, it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to Verifiability. The comment is a claim because it's suggesting a change (improving font size). Now, is this claim verifiable? Well, the reviewer is pointing out an issue, but there's no justification or reasoning provided. They're just stating that the font is small. Without any references or logical reasoning, it's hard to verify if this is a valid issue. So, it's unverifiable because there's no supporting evidence or explanation given.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness.

It explicitly states the action of comparing with another pre-trained model, which is clear. Then, it provides concrete details about which model to use and why. So, this seems highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to do and how to implement it. I think this should be a 5.\n\nNext, Grounding_specificity. The review mentions ExpertBert as a specific example of a pre-trained model. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed\u2014the comparison in data scarcity conditions. The grounding is strong because it references a specific model, and the specificity is about suggesting an alternative for fairness. So, this is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nFor Verifiability, the comment is making a claim that PMEF lacks a pre-training module, which is a valid point. It's supported by logical reasoning about fairness in comparisons. There's no need for external references here, just common knowledge about model architectures. So, this is fully verifiable, scoring a 5.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review clearly identifies a weakness in the comparison and provides a constructive suggestion.
