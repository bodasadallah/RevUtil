The reviewer is asking for a reason. Is this an explicit action? Yes, they're explaining why they chose OR and min over AND and max. But is it concrete? They don't specify why OR and min are better. They just state their choice without details. So it's explicit but vague.

So this is **Fully Grounded and Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim by suggesting their choice was better.

(2020) and didn't use domain adaptation methods from Section 8. It also suggests that the results may be attributed to something else. \n\nFor Actionability, it's about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. The review points out specific areas where the author should make comparisons. That's explicit. But it doesn't tell the author exactly how to perform these comparisons. For example, it says \"do a comparison,\" but doesn't specify what metrics to use or how to structure the analysis. So, it's explicit about the action but vague on the details. That makes it Borderline Actionable because the action is clear but lacks specifics.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions Campos et al. (2020) and Section 8, which are specific references. It's not just a general statement but points to exact sections. Then, it talks about attributing results, which is a general suggestion without specifics on how to do that. So, the grounding is good for the cited works but not for the attribution part. That makes it Weakly Grounded and Specific because it partially identifies the sections but doesn't specify how to attribute the results.\n\nVerifiability. The review contains claims like not comparing to a specific method and suggesting comparisons. These are opinions or judgments. For Verifiability, we need to see if these claims are supported. The mention of Campos et al. is a reference, which is verifiable, but the suggestion to add comparisons isn't backed by any evidence or references. So, it's Somewhat Verifiable because there's some justification but missing key elements like specific references or explanations.\n\nHelpfulness. The review does point out weaknesses and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it's vague on how to implement these suggestions. The author isn't told what to compare or how to structure the analysis.

It also asks about KNs in the source or English. The authors plan to correct the figure. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The first part is explicit because it tells the authors exactly what to do: add a comment about word embeddings. The second part is a bit vague because it's asking about KNs without specifying which one. The authors' response is clear, so that's good.

The comment refers to Lample et al.'s model and word embeddings, which is specific. It also asks about KNs without being vague. The authors can pinpoint the issue, so this is fully grounded. The specificity is good because it clearly states what needs to be addressed.

For the pooling method, it's just asking for what's used, which is explicit. But it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do, like suggesting a new method or citing a reference. So that's implicit. Then, for E_i, it's asking if it's a type or identity, which is also explicit but again doesn't give a clear action, like defining it or explaining its importance.

It also asks if the compression using Equation 3 is still applied. The reviewer is pointing out specific areas the authors need to address. This is explicit, so it's actionable. They're not just asking for more details but are prompting for specific information, which the authors can directly address. The action is clear, so it's not implicit. Also, the instructions are concrete, like mentioning the equation, so it's not vague. Therefore, this should be Highly Actionable (5).\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer is directly referencing the bilinear layer and Equation 3. They're not making any educated guesses; they're pinpointing specific sections of the paper. This makes the comment grounded because it accurately identifies the part being discussed. Additionally, they're being specific about the differences and the equation, so this is Fully Grounded and Specific (5).\n\nFor Verifiability, the reviewer is asking for clarification and explaining the differences. This is a claim because they're making a judgment about how the bilinear layer works compared to others. They're providing some reasoning by mentioning the dimensionality and the swapping process, which is logical. They're also referencing Equation 3, which is an external reference, making their claim verifiable. So this should be Fully Verifiable (5).\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The reviewer is providing clear questions that guide the authors to improve their work. They're not just pointing out issues but are asking specific questions that can lead to meaningful improvements. This is helpful because it gives the authors a clear direction on what to work on.

It also points out that previous work considers multiple vulnerabilities. The reviewer is suggesting that the authors should argue if this is an intended use case. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the review gives clear instructions. The reviewer is pointing out a methodological issue but doesn't explicitly tell the authors what to do next. They suggest considering multiple vulnerabilities but don't say how or why that should be done. So, it's implicit, which might be a bit vague.

It mentions minor language issues. For actionability, I need to check if the comments are explicit and concrete. The comment talks about the abstract lacking evaluation details, which is explicit. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do, like adding that section or explaining the evaluation. So it's not fully actionable. It's more of a suggestion but lacks specifics. So I think this is **Borderline Actionable** because it does hint at an action but doesn't provide clear steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The comment refers to the abstract but doesn't specify which part of the abstract is lacking. It just says \"lacks description of how the idea was evaluated.\" The authors might not know exactly where in the abstract to add more details. So the grounding is weak because it's not pinpointing a specific section or part. Therefore, this should be **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that the abstract is lacking in evaluation details. It's a claim that needs support. The justification is that it's a common issue, so it's supported by general knowledge. It's somewhat justified but not with specific references. So this is **Somewhat Verifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The comment points out the abstract's weakness and mentions language issues. It gives a clear area for improvement but doesn't specify how to fix it. It's helpful in identifying areas but lacks depth. So it's **Somewhat Helpful** because it does provide some guidance but isn't comprehensive.\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The review is pointing out specific areas but not giving detailed steps, so actionability is borderline. Grounding isn't specific, verifiability is somewhat justified, and helpfulness is somewhat helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The comment explicitly states that the abstract lacks evaluation details but doesn't provide concrete steps on how to address this, making it vague.\",\n   \"actionability_label\": \"Borderline Actionable\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The comment refers to the abstract but doesn't specify which part is lacking, resulting in weak grounding.\",\n   \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"Weakly Grounded and Not Specific\",\n   \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The comment makes a judgment about the abstract's deficiency, supported by general knowledge but lacking specific references.\",\n   \"verifiability_label\": \"Somewhat Verifiable\",\n   \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The comment identifies areas for improvement but doesn't specify how to fix them, providing some helpful insights.\",\n   \"helpfulness_label\": \"Somewhat Helpful\"\n}\n```"}
{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review points out that the description in the Method Section is confusing because it mentions \"sparse labels\" in the source domains but doesn't clarify whether the target domain uses unlabeled data as in the original MFDA paper. It also questions the use of unlabeled data in source domains during training. \n\nFor **Explicit vs. Implicit**, the reviewer explicitly mentions the confusion about the data usage. So that's explicit. Now, **Concrete vs. Vague**: The reviewer is pointing out a specific issue but doesn't provide a direct solution or how to address it. So it's vague. Therefore, this should be a **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but lacks detail on how to fix the problem.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer refers to the Method Section's first paragraph, which is specific, so grounding is strong. The specificity is about the data usage discrepancy. The reviewer clearly states what's wrong but doesn't explain how it affects the method or what needs to be done. So it's **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because while the part is identified, the specifics about the implications are not detailed.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment about the problem setting differing from the original paper. This is a claim that needs justification. However, the justification is vague\u2014it just mentions that it's confusing and refers to the original paper without specifics. So it's **2: Borderline Verifiable** because there's some support but it's not detailed enough.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer raises a valid concern about clarity and consistency with the original method. This is helpful because it points out a potential issue in the paper's description. However, it's somewhat vague and doesn't suggest a specific fix, so it's **3: Somewhat Helpful**. It gives the authors something to think about but doesn't provide a complete solution.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

It provides some definitions but doesn't give clear steps on how to implement this distinction. The reviewer is pointing out a gap in the methodology, but they don't offer specific actions or detailed guidance. So, this is more of an implicit suggestion without concrete steps. That makes it somewhat actionable but not fully. I think it's a 3 because it's explicit about the issue but lacks detail on how to fix it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer mentions that the sample data file's instance was classified as exclusionary extreme speech but doesn't specify why. They also ask about the exact regulation used for annotation. The comment doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper is being addressed (like a specific section or figure) and doesn't explain what's wrong with the classification. It's vague, so the grounding isn't strong. I'd rate this a 2 because it's weakly grounded but mentions the issue.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is pointing out a problem in the methodology but doesn't provide evidence or references to support why the distinction is difficult. They're making a judgment about the need for better differentiation but lack justification. This seems unverifiable because there's no supporting data or logic. So, this would be a 1.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer's comment is pointing out a specific issue and suggesting an improvement, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are vague and don't provide actionable steps. They also ask about local regulations without giving guidance on how to apply them. While it's somewhat helpful, it's not fully constructive.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review says that when the training and evaluation time-steps are the same, the models perform similarly. It questions if the proposed methods are effective when the goal is just good performance. It also suggests that under different time-step scenarios, the method might make more sense.\n\nIs this actionable? Well, it's making a point about performance under certain conditions but doesn't tell the authors what to do next. It's more of a critique and a suggestion for further consideration rather than a clear action. So, it's not very actionable because the authors aren't given a direct fix or improvement step. Maybe they should adjust their training or evaluation steps, but the review doesn't specify how. So, I'd rate this as 2: Borderline Actionable because it does hint at a possible improvement but doesn't tell exactly what to do.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions Figure 5 and compares baseline and time-aware models. It refers to the same time-step scenario but doesn't specify which part of the paper that relates to. It's a bit vague about where the issue lies. So, the grounding isn't very specific because it doesn't clearly point to the section or figure being discussed. It's more of a general critique without pinpointing the exact area. Therefore, this would be 3: Weakly Grounded and Specific because it does specify what models are compared but doesn't clearly explain why or how this affects the paper.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the effectiveness is questionable under certain conditions. It's suggesting a possible improvement but doesn't provide evidence or references to back this up. The reasoning is vague, just a suggestion without support. So, this is 2: Borderline Verifiable because there's a claim but no solid justification or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a potential limitation of the method but doesn't offer concrete suggestions or improvements. It's more of a critique than a constructive suggestion. So, it's somewhat helpful but lacks depth.

I think this falls under \"Borderline Actionable\" because it hints at an action but doesn't provide details.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review refers to \"Broader Impacts and Limitations\" and mentions a limitation but doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper it's talking about.

It suggests discussing or acknowledging this in the main text. Now, is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a direct action on how to fix it. They're making a statement that needs to be addressed elsewhere. So, it's implicit. Since it's not giving a clear action, it's not actionable. So, I'd give it a 1 for actionability.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions ICL-HAR but doesn't specify which part of the paper or figure this refers to. They're talking about accuracy scores dropping, but not linking it directly to ICL-HAR. So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint exactly where the issue is.

It says to run experiments if the figures don't show results for untrained networks and to add those to the figures and table. It also asks to clarify whether the dotted lines in Figure 3c are from random data or unaltered data, and whether the non-random data is normalized. Additionally, it suggests ideally showing some examples of the random data in the appendix.\n\nSo, the actions here are clear: run experiments, add figures, clarify data, and show examples. But how explicit and concrete are these actions? The instructions are specific about what to do, so that's explicit. Now, are these actions clear and detailed? The reviewer is asking to add specific experiments, clarify technical aspects, and include examples. These are all concrete steps. So, this seems to be highly actionable because the reviewer is giving precise instructions on what needs to be done.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer is addressing Figure 3c, which is specific. They're asking about the data used in that figure, so they're pinning down exactly which part of the paper they're referring to. That's explicit grounding. Then, they're asking for clarification on whether the data is normalized or not, which is a specific aspect of the figure. They're also suggesting adding examples to the appendix, which is a specific part of the supplementary material. So, the grounding is strong because they're clearly pointing to a specific section and asking about specific details there.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is making claims by suggesting improvements and asking for experiments. These are opinions or suggestions. Now, are these claims supported by evidence? The reviewer is asking for experiments, which is a logical request. They're also asking for clarification, which is a common-sense request. There's no external reference cited here, but the reasoning is clear. So, the claims are somewhat justified with logical reasoning and common knowledge, making it somewhat verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is providing clear suggestions: run experiments, clarify the figure, and add examples. These are actionable and specific. They're not vague; each point is distinct and directly addresses potential issues in the paper. The suggestions are constructive and would help the authors improve their work. So, this review is highly helpful because it gives meaningful feedback without being too broad or unclear.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect seems to be at least a 4 or 5.

The review says, \"Although using advantage instead of q value is more common in practice...\" It suggests a change in terminology. Is this an explicit action? The reviewer is pointing out a specific change, so that's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The reviewer isn't telling the authors how to implement this change. They just mention that advantage is more common. So, it's explicit but vague. That would be a 3 on the actionability scale.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The reviewer is talking about terminology, but they don't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. They just say \"the paper\" or \"the analysis.\" So, the grounding is weak because they can't pinpoint the section. They also don't provide specific examples, just a general suggestion. So, grounding_specificity would be 2 because it's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a judgment about terminology usage but isn't providing any justification or references. They're just stating that advantage is more common. There's no supporting evidence, so this is unverifiable. That would score a 1 on verifiability.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The reviewer is suggesting a change in terminology, which could be helpful. However, it's quite vague. They don't explain why advantage is better or how it affects their analysis.

Please define the dashed lines in fig. 2A-B and 4B.\" I have to look at it from four aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with actionability. The review is asking the authors to define dashed lines in specific figures. Is this an explicit action? It says \"define,\" which is pretty direct. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The authors need to know exactly what to do\u2014identify and label the dashed lines. There's no ambiguity here, so it's concrete. Therefore, this should be highly actionable, giving a 5.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The comment is pointing to specific figures (2A-B and 4B). The authors can pinpoint exactly where the dashed lines are, so that's full grounding. Then, it specifies what needs to be done\u2014define them. So it's both grounded and specific. That gives it a 5 here too.\n\nFor verifiability, the comment is a suggestion, not a claim. So it doesn't require evidence. It's just asking for a definition, which is straightforward. Therefore, it's not verifiable in the sense of supporting a claim, but since it's a suggestion, it's somewhat helpful. Wait, no\u2014verifiability is about whether the suggestion is supported. Since it's a direct instruction, it's not a claim, so it's X for verifiability. But looking back, the instruction is to evaluate based on the definitions. Since it's a suggestion without any claim, it's X.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The comment is clear and directly tells the authors what to do. It's specific about the figures and the action. It doesn't leave room for interpretation, so it's highly helpful. So that's a 5.\n\nWait, but for verifiability, since it's not a claim, it's X.

But the user mentioned that if there's no claim, score it as X.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review suggests that the description in Section 4.2 doesn't match the equation and mentions the absence of r^q in the equation. It also questions what \u03c3 means. The reviewer is pointing out specific issues that the authors can fix. This is explicit because they're directly pointing out missing elements and unclear terms. Then, they explain what \u03c3 might mean, which gives a clear direction for the authors to check their equation and understand the notation. So, this is both explicit and provides enough detail, making it actionable. I think this should be a 5 because it's clear and direct.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer refers to Section 4.2 and specifically mentions the equation, which the authors can point to. They also clarify what \u03c3 means, which is a specific part of the equation. This shows strong grounding because they're pointing to the exact section and even explaining a term within it. So, this should be a 5 as well.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that the description doesn't match the equation and that \u03c3 is unclear. They back up their claim by explaining what \u03c3 might be, which is a logical reasoning step. They also suggest that the equation might be numerically unstable, which is a valid point that the authors can verify. This is well-supported, so it's fully verifiable. I'll give it a 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out specific issues, suggesting fixes, and clarifying a term. This is very helpful because it directly addresses potential problems the authors might have. The suggestions are clear and actionable, so this should be a 5 as well.\n\nI don't see any issues where the review isn't helpful or where grounding or actionability are lacking.

It also asks about model performance and structural collapse, and wants to know the accuracy numbers. \n\nFor actionability, it's about how clear and direct the suggestions are. The point is explicit in asking for more details, which is good. However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly what to add or how to explain the learning curves. So, it's not fully actionable because the authors still need to infer where to focus their edits. Maybe they should break it down more, like specifying the sections of the experimental setting and what exactly to explain in the figure. So, I'd rate this as **3: Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear but lacks detail on implementation.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions specific parts of the paper, like Fig 3 and the learning curves, which is good. It also asks about model performance and structural collapse, which are specific aspects. However, it doesn't clearly explain what exactly needs to be done, like whether they need to correlate the curves with M-PHATE or what specific features to highlight. So, while it's grounded in the paper, the specificity is under because it's not clear what exactly needs to be addressed. I'd give this a **3: Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it identifies parts but doesn't clearly specify the details needed.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review includes claims like \"worse performing model always result in structural collapse\" and \"what is the accuracy number\". These are opinions or suggestions, so they are claims. Now, the verifiability part: the review doesn't provide any justification or references for these claims. It just states them without supporting evidence. So, it's not verifiable because there's no backing for these points. I'd rate this as **1: Unverifiable** because the claims lack justification.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

They mention \"support data\" and \"predicted training count data.\" The reviewer is pointing to a specific figure, so they can accurately pinpoint where the data is. Then, they're asking about the model, which is a specific part of the methodology. So, the grounding is strong because they're referring to specific sections and components. The specificity is also good because they're clearly asking about what each part means. This would be a 5 for grounding_specificity.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The reviewer is asking for examples, definitions, and model details. These are all factual and require justification. For example, explaining what \"support data\" means might involve referencing the methodology or citing a source.

The reviewer is pointing out that the paper's approach is similar to others, but they don't tell the authors exactly what to do. They don't specify changes or improvements.

The action here is pointing out a lack of explanation and an assumption. But is this actionable? The reviewer is pointing out a problem but isn't giving a specific fix. So, it's more of a suggestion rather than an explicit action. That might be considered implicit, so maybe it's not highly actionable. I'd rate this as 3 because it's somewhat actionable but vague on how to improve.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The comment talks about morphologic segmentation across domains but doesn't specify which part of the paper it's referring to. It's a general statement without pinpointing an issue. So, the grounding is weak because it's not clearly identifying the section or aspect of the paper. Maybe a 2 here since it's not fully grounded.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is making a judgment that morphologic segmentation is invariant across domains. It's a claim that needs justification. However, the reviewer doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to support this assumption. It's vague and lacks evidence, so it's not very verifiable. Maybe a 2 here as well.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

The review says, \"can you explicitly say what labels for each dataset in 4.1 are - where are they coming from?\" It's asking the author to clarify where the labels in dataset 4.1 come from. Is this an explicit action? Well, it's a question, so the author needs to provide more information. Is it vague? It tells the author to explain where the labels are from but doesn't specify how. So, I think it's borderline actionable because it's asking for an explicit action but isn't giving much detail on how to do it.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review is asking about the origin of dataset labels. The author needs to identify which part of the paper this refers to. Since the review mentions dataset 4.1 specifically, it's clear which part is being addressed. So, grounding is fully grounded. Now, how specific is it? The review is asking about the source of labels, which is a specific detail. So, it's fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor verifiability, the review is a claim because it's asking for clarification. Is this claim verifiable? Well, the author can look into the dataset's documentation or the paper's methodology section to find where the labels come from. So, there's supporting information, making it somewhat verifiable. It's not fully verifiable because the author might need to infer from context, but it's better than unverifiable.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review is asking for clarification on where labels come from. It's helpful because it guides the author to check documentation or methodology. However, it's quite generic and doesn't provide specific suggestions or ask for improvements. So, it's somewhat helpful but not the most detailed. Maybe a 3 or 4.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the scores would be:\n- Actionability: 2 (borderline actionable)\n- Grounding: 5 (fully grounded and specific)\n- Verifiability: 3 (somewhat verifiable)\n- Helpfulness: 3 (somewhat helpful)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review asks the author to clarify where the labels in dataset 4.1 come from, which is an explicit action but lacks specific guidance on how to implement it.\",\n  \"actionability_label\": \"2\",\n  \"grounding_specificity_rationale\": \"The review explicitly mentions dataset 4.1 and asks about the origin of labels, which is fully grounded and specific.\",\n  \"grounding_specificity_label\": \"5\",\n  \"verifiability_rationale\": \"The review contains a claim (asking for clarification) that is somewhat verifiable as the author can infer from the paper's context.\",\n  \"verifiability_label\": \"3\",\n  \"helpfulness_rationale\": \"The review is helpful as it prompts the author to check documentation but is somewhat generic and lacks specific suggestions.\",\n  \"helpfulness_label\": \"3\"\n}\n```"}

It seems like the reviewer is pointing out that the process of calculating \u03bb isn't clearly explained. They want more details on how \u03bb is derived. Is this an explicit or implicit action? Well, the reviewer is suggesting a specific action, which is to explain how \u03bb is computed. That's explicit. But is it concrete? The reviewer isn't giving any details on how to compute \u03bb, just asking for an explanation. So it's explicit but vague. Therefore, it's borderline actionable. Maybe a 2 or 3.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer is asking about the computation of \u03bb but doesn't specify which part of the paper they're referring to. They just mention lines 281-285 and 310-313. Without more context, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where \u03bb is discussed. So the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the referenced part. But they do mention where it might be, so it's not fully grounded. The specificity is about what needs to be addressed, which is the computation method. They do specify that, so it's somewhat specific. So maybe a 3 for grounding specificity.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is asking a question about how \u03bb is computed. There's no claim here; it's just a question.

Here, the reviewer is pointing out that their method isn't novel, which is an explicit statement. But does it tell them how to improve?

They suggest that even with beam search, there's only a 77% accuracy. The reviewer is pointing out that without ground truth, it's unclear if the entities are correct. So, the action suggested is to check the entities, but the instructions aren't explicit on how to do that. It's vague on how to apply the suggestion, so it's not actionable. Therefore, this review is not actionable because the action isn't clear.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer does mention section 4.3 and 4.4, which is specific about where the issue lies. However, the suggestion is quite vague\u2014checking entities without specifics on which part or how. They don't clearly state what needs to be addressed in those sections. So, while the grounding is somewhat specific, the specificity in detailing what needs fixing is lacking. It's weakly grounded because they can identify the sections but not what exactly is wrong.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is pointing out a claim that beam search has a 77% accuracy. They're suggesting improvements but not providing evidence or reasoning to back it up. There's no justification or references, so the claim isn't well-supported. Therefore, it's not verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer's comment is pointing out a concern but doesn't offer concrete solutions or improvements. They're raising a valid point but not providing actionable advice. It's more of a critique than a helpful suggestion, so it's not very helpful.\n\nPutting it all together, the review is somewhat actionable but lacks clarity, grounding, verifiability, and helpfulness.

The rationale is that graphs with repeated labels need multiplicities. The comment is explicit about suggesting a change, so that's an explicit action. It also provides a clear reason why a multiset is needed, which is about repeated vertex or edge labels. Since both the action and the reasoning are explicit and concrete, this should be **Highly Actionable** (5).\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions section 4 and specifically suggests changing \"X\" from a set to a multiset.

It also asks two specific questions about assumptions and selection criteria. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the suggestions are explicit and concrete. The first part about adding a table is explicit because it tells the author exactly what to do. However, the second part with the two questions is more vague. The author isn't told exactly how to apply the table or what changes to make beyond adding it. So, it's partially actionable but not fully because one part is explicit and the other is vague.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions adding a table but doesn't specify which part of the paper that table should address. It also asks about assumptions and selection criteria but doesn't clearly explain why the current criteria are chosen. So, the grounding is weak because it doesn't pinpoint the exact sections or provide clear guidance on the methods.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The claims here are that the writing could be improved and that a table would help. These are clear opinions, so they are claims. The justification provided is vague, just stating the suggestions without much reasoning or references. There's no specific examples or external sources, so it's not fully verifiable.

The review points are about needing to report averages over multiple runs, discussing decision boundaries, and explaining what's in Figure 9. For each of these, the comments are giving suggestions but not specifying exactly how to implement them. For example, saying \"report average over multiple runs\" is an action, but it doesn't tell the authors how to calculate or present it. Similarly, discussing decision boundaries is a suggestion, but it's vague on what analysis to do. Same with explaining Figure 9; it's a request but lacks specifics. So, these are all implicit actions. Therefore, the actionability is borderline because the actions are clear but not detailed enough.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review mentions sections 3.1 and 3.3, which is good because it's specific about which parts of the paper need improvement. However, it doesn't tell the authors what exactly to do in those sections. For instance, in section 3.1, it suggests discussing decision boundaries but doesn't specify what kind of discussion or what aspects to focus on. Similarly, Figure 9 is referenced but not explained in detail. So, while the grounding is clear (they know which sections), the specificity is lacking because it doesn't detail the required changes.\n\nVerifiability. The review points are clear and specific. For example, suggesting to report averages implies that this is a common practice, so it's verifiable. Discussing decision boundaries is a logical suggestion based on standard analysis practices. Explaining Figure 9 is also a logical step because figures are part of the results. Therefore, these claims are well-supported and verifiable, so the verifiability is high.\n\nHelpfulness. The review provides several meaningful suggestions that are actionable. It tells the authors what needs to be done without being vague. For example, it's clear that they need to report averages and discuss decision boundaries. It doesn't just say \"improve the paper\" but specifically points out areas. So, this is highly helpful because it gives concrete directions.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the definitions provided.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the three aspects: actionability, grounding specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me start by reading the review point carefully.\n\nThe review point says: \"PPG outputs a complete pose relative to every part\u2019s center. Thus O_{up} should contain the offset for every keypoint with respect to the center of the upper part. In Eq.2 of the supplementary material, it seems that O_{up} is trained to output the offset for the keypoints that are not farther than a distance r) to the center of corresponding part. How are the groundtruths actually built? If it is the latter, how can the network parts responsible for each part predict all the keypoints of the pose.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what the review point is asking. It seems to be pointing out a potential issue with how the PPG (which I assume is a network or model) is supposed to output offsets for keypoints. The user is questioning whether the groundtruths are correctly built and how the network can predict all keypoints if it's only handling those within a certain distance from the center.\n\nNow, let's tackle each aspect one by one.\n\n**Actionability:**\nThe review point is asking a question, which is a good way to get clarification. However, it's quite vague. It doesn't specify what exactly is wrong with the current implementation or how to fix it. The question is broad and doesn't provide explicit steps or actions the authors can take. So, it's not very actionable because the user needs more detailed information to act upon.\n\n**Grounding Specificity:**\nThe review point mentions \"every part\u2019s center,\" \"keypoints,\" \"O_{up},\" and \"Eq.2 of the supplementary material.\" It does reference specific parts of the paper, like the supplementary material, which shows that it's grounded. However, the specificity of the issue is a bit vague. The user is asking about how groundtruths are built and how the network predicts all keypoints, which is somewhat specific but could be more precise. It's clear that the comment is addressing a specific part of the paper, so grounding is okay, but the specificity could be improved by being more detailed about the exact issue.\n\n**Verifiability:**\nThe review point presents a question about the implementation details of the PPG model. It doesn't make any claims or assertions; it's more of a clarification request. Since there's no claim being made, it doesn't fall under verifiability. The comment is just asking for information, so it's not verifiable in the sense of providing new information or justification.\n\n**Helpfulness:**\nThe review point is asking for clarification, which is helpful in itself because it can prompt the authors to provide more details. However, it's somewhat vague and doesn't directly address potential issues or improvements. It's helpful but lacks the depth that could make it more impactful. The authors might need more specific guidance to understand where the problem lies and how to fix it.\n\nIn summary, the review point is clear and grounded but lacks explicitness and detail, making it somewhat helpful but not highly so. It's not very actionable because it doesn't provide concrete steps. The grounding is good, but the specificity could be better. Verifiability isn't applicable here since there's no claim being made.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review point is a question seeking clarification but lacks explicit steps or actions for the authors to take.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**. The review points out that the figures are small and hard to read, mentions equation 5 not following from 4, and questions the definition of \u03b8^{t+1/2}, and finally points out that S* and S~ are important but not properly defined. \n\nFor each of these, the review gives explicit suggestions. Like, \"improve the figure size\" and \"clarify the derivation of equation 5 from 4.\" These are clear actions. However, for the last two points, it's more of a question or critique without a specific action. So, while the first two are actionable, the latter two are more about pointing out issues rather than giving direct fixes. So, I think this is **Somewhat Actionable** because not all parts are actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions specific issues like figure size, equation derivation, and parameters S* and S~. It references equation 4 and Assumption 1, which shows it's trying to pinpoint where the problems are. However, when it talks about \u03b8^{t+1/2}, it's a bit vague about how it's used. So, it's not fully specific because one part is a bit unclear. I'd rate this as **Weakly Grounded and Specific** because it does identify the sections but isn't entirely clear on how \u03b8 is used.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes claims about the figures being unreadable, equation derivation, and parameter definitions. Each of these can be supported by common knowledge or references. For example, figures being small is a known issue, equation derivations can be explained logically, and parameter definitions can be supported by standard practices. So, this is **Fully Verifiable** because each claim has solid backing.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review provides clear feedback on multiple points, which is helpful for the authors. It doesn't just point out problems but also suggests improvements like figure size and equation clarity. However, it's a bit lengthy and could be more concise. So, it's **Somewhat Helpful** because it's useful but could be trimmed down for brevity and focus.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review provides explicit suggestions for improving figure size and equation clarity but lacks specific actions for addressing \u03b8^{t+1/2} and the definitions of S* and S~.

It's explicit about the action\u2014increasing font size\u2014but it doesn't specify how to do it, like whether to use a certain tool or method. So, it's explicit but lacks detail on the implementation. That makes it somewhat actionable because the authors know what to do, but they don't know the exact steps. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**: The comment mentions legends, axis labels, and font size. It's pretty specific about where to make changes. It doesn't mention anything external or general, so the grounding is strong. It clearly identifies the issue in these parts, so I think this is 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim because it suggests a change (larger font). It doesn't provide any justification or evidence for why this change is necessary. It's just a recommendation without backing, so it's unverifiable. That would be a score of 1: Unverifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The comment is clear and directly points out an issue, which is helpful. It guides the authors to improve their figures but doesn't go into why the change is needed or how effective it will be. It's somewhat helpful because it gives a direction, but it's not the most detailed. So, I'd give it a 3: Somewhat Helpful.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects.

The action here is to compare, but it's not very specific. The reviewer doesn't tell the authors exactly where to add the comparison or how to implement it. So, it's explicit in asking for a comparison but lacks detail on how to do it. That makes it borderline actionable because the action is clear but the method is vague.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer mentions Journey TRAK and specifically points out Figure 2. That's pretty specific because they're referring to a particular figure in the paper. They also clearly state what they want to compare, which is the effect of removing high-scoring images. So, this is fully grounded because they pinpoint the section and what needs fixing.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is making a claim by suggesting a specific comparison. They back it up by referencing Figure 2 and comparing it to CLIP cosine similarity. This provides logical reasoning and external references, so it's fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The comment is clear and suggests a meaningful improvement by comparing with an existing method. It gives a specific direction, which is helpful for the authors.

It talks about the theorems following from algorithm design and mutual information. It also suggests providing sample complexity results. Now, actionability is about how explicit and concrete the suggestions are. \n\nThe review does suggest specific areas for improvement, like sample complexity-type results. That's explicit. However, it doesn't tell the author exactly how to compute or implement these results. It's vague on the methods or steps needed.

The reviewer is talking about different regression methods, but they don't clearly identify which part of the paper they're referring to.

The review says that the standard deviation isn't provided, and the improvement from SoRA isn't clear because of random fluctuations. It suggests the author clarify which effects are within the SD range and which are improvements. \n\nIs this explicit? Yes, it tells the author what to do. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? It says to clarify which effects are within the SD and which are improvements. But it doesn't tell exactly how to do that. For example, it doesn't specify to calculate confidence intervals or perform statistical tests. So it's explicit but not concrete. Therefore, it's **Somewhat Actionable** because it's clear what needs to be done but lacks specific steps.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions the experimental section and the issue with standard deviation. It doesn't specify which part of the experimental section, like a particular figure or table. It also doesn't provide examples or specific data points. So the grounding is weak because it's not pointing to a specific part. Therefore, it's **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review is making a claim that the improvement is limited due to random fluctuations. It needs justification. The review doesn't explain why random fluctuations would make the improvement seem limited or provide evidence for this. It's vague, so it's **Unverifiable**.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out issues and suggests improvements, which is helpful. However, it's vague about how to proceed, so the authors might not know exactly what to do. It's somewhat helpful but not fully.

Each of these is a direct action the authors can take. There's no ambiguity here; the actions are clear and explicit. Also, each action provides specific instructions, so the authors know exactly what to do. That makes it highly actionable because there's no vagueness involved. So, I think the actionability score should be 5.\n\nNext, grounding specificity. The review points mention specific line numbers and even ask to define a symbol and clarify a figure's caption. Each of these points clearly references a specific part of the paper. For example, line 148 is a specific line, and the figure caption is a specific element. The authors can easily pinpoint where to make changes. There's no weakness in grounding because each point directly addresses a specific section. So, grounding specificity is fully grounded and specific, giving it a 5.\n\nMoving on to verifiability. Each of the review points is a claim that needs to be supported. For instance, fixing a typo is a clear action, defining a symbol is a straightforward request, and clarifying the figure's caption is a logical step. These claims are well-supported without needing external references. The reasoning is logical and the references are clear, so verifiability is fully supported. That gives it a 5.\n\nLastly, helpfulness. The review points are very specific and actionable. They address clear issues without being vague. Each point is concise and directly helpful, providing the authors with clear directions on what to do. This makes the review highly helpful because it gives meaningful feedback that the authors can use effectively. So, helpfulness is a 5.\n\nI think each aspect is scored 5 because the review points are explicit, specific, well-supported, and directly helpful to the authors.

The review mentions that Pearson correlation is a more relaxed constraint than KL divergence because of scale and shift invariance. It then compares loss functions using their gradient distributions, noting that KL and MSE have the same optimal solution, but MSE is stricter because of its gradient. The reviewer suggests comparing gradients between KL and PCC. \n\nIs this actionable? Well, it's suggesting a specific comparison between two metrics. The reviewer is asking the authors to look at the gradients, which is a clear action. But the action is a bit vague because it doesn't specify exactly how to compare them. It just says \"provide the gradient comparison.\" So, the authors would need to figure out how to do that, which makes it somewhat vague. \n\nSo, on the actionability scale, it's probably **3: Somewhat Actionable** because the action is explicit but lacks detail on how to implement it.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review talks about loss functions, their gradient distributions, and compares KL with PCC. It mentions specific loss functions like MSE and their properties. However, it doesn't clearly identify which part of the paper or method it's referring to.

The review makes a claim that PCC is a more relaxed constraint than KL due to invariance. It then provides reasoning about gradient distributions and compares MSE with KL. The reasoning is logical, and it references well-known loss functions, which are common knowledge. So, the claim is well-supported.\n\nTherefore, verifiability is **5: Fully Verifiable** because the reasoning is clear and supported by established concepts.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**.

It mentions different model architectures but doesn't specify which part of the paper or section this refers to. It's a bit vague. So, it's not fully grounded because it doesn't point to a specific section or figure. Maybe a 4 since it's clear where the issue is but doesn't specify what needs fixing.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review suggests that the trend isn't clear and lacks theoretical support. It doesn't provide any references or logical reasoning to back up the claim that the trend holds across architectures. So, it's not well-supported. Maybe a 1 because it's unverifiable without more evidence.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review is pointing out a problem but doesn't offer specific solutions or improvements. It's vague and doesn't guide the authors on how to proceed. So, it's not very helpful. Maybe a 2 since it's better than nothing but could be improved.\n\nI think that's a reasonable breakdown.

{"generated_text": "Okay, so I need to evaluate this review point based on the aspects: actionability, grounding_specificity, verifiability, and helpfulness. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with **Actionability**: The review says that approximation error is the gap between objective values, which is ambiguous without the table. It suggests providing a mathematical characterization. \n\nFirst, is this an explicit or implicit action? The reviewer is pointing out a problem (ambiguity) and suggesting a solution (mathematical characterization). That's explicit because they're directly telling the authors what to do. \n\nNext, is the action concrete? The reviewer isn't just saying to fix it; they're specifying to define approximation error mathematically. That gives the authors a clear direction, so it's concrete. \n\nSo, this should be **5: Highly Actionable** because it's both explicit and concrete.\n\nMoving on to **Grounding Specificity**: The reviewer mentions approximation error as the issue but doesn't specify where in the paper this applies. They don't mention a particular section or table, so it's not fully grounded. Also, they're not being specific about what needs fixing. \n\nTherefore, this is **1: Not Grounded** because the part of the paper isn't clearly identified.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a judgment that the current definition is ambiguous and suggesting a mathematical approach. They're providing a claim (that a mathematical characterization would help) and supporting it by stating it's a judgment. \n\nThis is **5: Fully Verifiable** because the reasoning is clear and logical, even though there's no external reference, it's a well-understood practice in mathematics and computer science.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**: The reviewer is pointing out a clear weakness (ambiguity) and suggesting a specific improvement (mathematical definition). This is helpful because it guides the authors to make their results clearer. \n\nSo, this should be **4: Mostly Helpful** because while it's helpful, it could be expanded by providing more details on how to mathematically define the error.\n\nI think I've covered all aspects.

The review says the model only produces 1 node changing cluster per time step because of the reassignment probability being 1/n. It also mentions the model is simplistic, only changing edges with 1 node per cluster. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if this is explicit or implicit. The review explicitly states the reassignment probability and the simplicity of the model. It suggests changes but doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. So, it's explicit but vague. Maybe the authors know to adjust the reassignment probability, but it's not detailed. So, I'd rate this as 3: Somewhat Actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The review mentions the reassignment probability and the simplicity of the model. It clearly states what's wrong and what's missing. It doesn't refer to specific parts of the paper beyond the model's components. So, it's fully grounded because it points to the model's specific aspects. The specificity is good because it explains the limitation and suggests an improvement. So, this would be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the review makes a claim that the model's dynamics are slow and simplistic. It supports this with the reassignment probability and the model's structure. The reasoning is logical and provides clear justification. So, this is fully verifiable, scoring 5.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The review points out clear issues and suggests improvements. It's specific about the model's limitations and proposes a change. This is helpful because it guides the authors to adjust their model. It's somewhat general but still useful. So, I'd rate this as 4: Mostly Helpful.\n\nI think that's a thorough evaluation.

It also suggests adding a flow chart and providing runtimes for solving the OT problem and sample selection. \n\nFor actionability, I need to see if the comments are explicit and concrete. The review points out specific questions about the process, which is explicit. However, it doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next, like suggesting a flow chart or providing runtimes.

The questions are about specific aspects of the methodology, so the grounding is pretty solid. The review is pointing to exact parts, so I think this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nMoving on to **Verifiability**. The review is making claims about whether the OT process runs once or iteratively, which is a judgment. It also suggests adding a flow chart and providing runtimes, which are verifiable through the paper's methodology. The verifiability here is good because it references specific parts of the paper, like equations and sections, so it's somewhat supported but maybe not fully robust.

So, it's an implicit action but vague on how to implement it. That would be a 3 for actionability.\n\nNext, grounding_specificity. The review doesn't mention any specific part of the paper. It's a general suggestion about evaluation methods, so the grounding is weak because it can't pinpoint where the issue lies. It's not grounded at all. So, grounding_specificity would be 1.\n\nFor verifiability, the reviewer is making a claim that human evaluations are more convincing.

The review says the authors think there's no negative social impact, but the reviewer doubts this and suggests mentioning automation risks or dual use. The action here is suggesting improvements, but it's vague. The reviewer isn't giving a clear action like editing the text or adding a discussion section. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an implication, which makes it implicit. Since it's vague, the authors don't know exactly how to apply this. So, it's borderline actionable because it's implied but lacks detail.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer mentions potential issues like automation and dual use but doesn't specify which part of the paper to address. They're pointing out general concerns without pinpointing a specific section or figure. So, the grounding is weak because they can't confidently identify the referenced part. The specificity is also low because they're not clearly stating what needs fixing in that area. Therefore, it's weakly grounded and not specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the reviewer is making a claim that there could be negative social impacts, which is a subjective opinion. They're suggesting improvements but not providing evidence or references. The justification is vague, so it's not well-supported. This makes it borderline verifiable because there's some suggestion but lacks the necessary details or references.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out potential issues and suggesting improvements, which is helpful. However, the suggestions are too vague and not directly tied to the paper's content. The authors still don't know exactly what to do or where to add content. So, it's somewhat helpful because it does identify areas for improvement but lacks depth and specificity in the suggestions.\n\nPutting it all together, each aspect has its own evaluation based on the definitions provided. The review does help the authors by highlighting concerns but doesn't provide clear guidance, making it somewhat helpful.

Then, it explains what's wrong with the notation, which is specific. So this should be 5: Fully Grounded and Specific.\n\nVerifiability.

The reviewer is making a suggestion, so that's explicit. But is it concrete? The reviewer doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do. They mention style and instance-specific, but don't provide clear steps or examples. So it's explicit but vague. That would make it **Borderline Actionable**.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The reviewer talks about style being instance-specific and content transferable, referencing external work. They also ask a question about the model's dynamics. The mention of style and instance-specific is specific, so the grounding is clear. They also explain what they mean by style, which adds specificity.

It points out specific points, like the variance difference in figures. It also talks about the quantization loss in MHSA compared to other models. Now, looking at the explicitness, the review is clear about the issues, so that's explicit. For concreteness, it mentions specific figures and other works, so it's concrete. Therefore, it's highly actionable because the authors know exactly what to look into and what references to check.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**.

At L384, it says \"Could mention that you mean |Y_t - Y_{t-1}| \\leq c_t almost surely.\" This is an explicit action suggesting the authors clarify their notation. It's clear and specific, so that's good. Then at L431, it says \"\\mu_t should be \\tilde \\mu_t, yes?\" This is a direct question, which is also explicit. However, it's a bit vague because it doesn't specify how to implement the change. So, it's somewhat actionable but not fully concrete.

The reviewer mentions the first 10 questions but doesn't specify which part of the paper or why this is an issue. They just point out that it's an odd design choice.

So, this should be highly actionable.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The reviewer talks about the Vandermonde matrix and its properties, which are specific to the algorithm.

The reviewer's claim is that the Vandermonde matrix is ill-conditioned and that this leads to numerical instability, especially with small \u03b1. They back this up by stating that \u03b1 can be as small as 1/k\u00b2L\u00b2, which is a specific calculation. They also suggest experiments as a solution, which is a logical next step. So, their reasoning is clear and supported by specific examples and logical deductions. This makes the claim fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, **Helpfulness**. The reviewer is pointing out a critical flaw in the algorithm's numerical stability, suggesting experiments as a solution. This is very helpful because it directly addresses a potential weakness and provides a clear next step for the authors.

The review mentions specific issues like larger fonts and words in a grey box, and points out that V_mem, Th_i, U_i^t are too small. It also suggests a \"CTRL\" long form explanation and that Figure 2's font is too small. These are all explicit actions the authors should take. Additionally, it provides concrete details about the parameters being too small and suggests a table for comparison. So, this is highly actionable because the reviewer is clear about what needs to be done and even gives specifics on how to implement it.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The review refers to specific figures (Figure 1 and 2) and mentions particular elements like font size and words in a grey box. It also points out specific parameters (V_mem, Th_i, U_i^t) and suggests a table for comparison. This means the reviewer is accurately pinpointing the parts of the paper and clearly explaining what's wrong. So, this is fully grounded and specific.\n\nFor Verifiability, the review provides clear justifications. It explains why larger fonts are needed, mentions standard practices about font sizes, and suggests a table as a clear solution. There's logical reasoning and references to common knowledge, so this is fully verifiable.\n\nLastly, Helpfulness. The review offers detailed feedback on multiple issues, suggests specific changes, and provides clear recommendations. It's comprehensive and guides the authors effectively, so it's highly helpful.\n\nI think each aspect is scored 5 because the review is explicit, well-grounded, well-verified, and very helpful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"actionability_rationale\": \"The review explicitly states actions such as increasing font sizes, suggesting a 'CTRL' long form explanation, and recommending a table for comparison.

Please rewrite it.\" The reviewer is asking for clarification. \n\nIs this explicit or implicit? Well, the reviewer is pointing out that they don't understand the sentence. So, they're asking for an explanation or a rewrite, which is an explicit action. But the action is to rewrite or explain, not something concrete like fixing a specific part. So, it's explicit but vague because they don't specify what's wrong or how to fix it. Therefore, it's borderline actionable because the action is clear but lacks detail.\n\nNext, Grounding Specificity. The reviewer is asking about a specific sentence in the paper. They mention page 5, paragraph 3, line. So, they're pointing to a specific part. The comment is grounded because they're referring to a specific location. However, they're asking for clarification, which is somewhat specific about what they don't understand. So, it's weakly grounded but not fully because they're not specifying exactly what's unclear. But since they did mention the sentence, it's better than not pointing to anything. So, I'd say it's weakly grounded and specific.\n\nVerifiability. The reviewer is asking for clarification, which is a claim. But there's no supporting evidence or reasoning. They're just asking for an explanation, which is a subjective request. So, it's unverifiable because there's no justification or references provided. It's just a request without any backing.\n\nHelpfulness. The reviewer is asking for a rewrite or clarification, which is somewhat helpful. They do want to understand the sentence better, but it's vague. They don't get specific advice on how to improve it or what changes to make.

But it's vague on what specific changes to make, like which tasks or how to implement them. So, it's explicit but not concrete. I think that's a 3: Somewhat Actionable because it tells the authors what to do but doesn't specify how.\n\nNext, **Grounding_specificity**. The review mentions the lack of motivation but doesn't point to a specific part of the paper. It's a general critique without pinpointing where the issue is. So, the grounding is weak because it can't accurately identify the referenced part. It's not grounded at all, so I'd give it a 1: Not Grounded and Not Specific.\n\nFor **Verifiability**, the comment is a claim that the motivation is unclear. It doesn't provide any supporting evidence or justification for why the motivation is lacking. It's just a statement without backing, so it's unverifiable.

Yes, it's telling the authors to include ATA. So it's explicit. Now, is it concrete? The suggestion is to add ATA to the comparison, but it doesn't specify how to do that, like mentioning a specific section or providing data. So it's not very concrete. Therefore, this is **Somewhat Actionable** because it's explicit but vague on the implementation.\n\nNext, **Grounding Specificity**. The comment mentions adding ATA to the comparison in Table 2. It's clear which part of the paper is being addressed\u2014the tables. It doesn't mention anything else, so the grounding is strong because it's pointing to a specific section.

The reviewer is pointing out a specific part of the text\u2014the axes being squished and the improvement being difficult to characterize as remarkable.

It mentions modest enhancements and suggests further refinement, which is a bit vague. It doesn't tell the authors exactly what to do next or how to improve. So, it's not explicit.

The review talks about performance enhancements but doesn't specify which part of the paper or model this refers to. It's too general.

The review points to specific sections (lines 230-234 and 234-235) and Figure 2. It mentions \"MLP\" without defining it.

The reviewer is clearly pointing out a specific issue (the discrepancy) and suggesting a possible improvement. That seems explicit. Now, is the action clear?

It mentions that gradients are computed for early layers but doesn't specify what the authors should do next. So, it's not explicit. It's more of an observation, so maybe it's not actionable enough.
