The rationales provide explanations for the scores.\n\n###Evaluation:\n- The evaluation is based on the accuracy of the scores and the quality of the rationales. The scores should be accurate and reflect the actual helpfulness and actionability of the review points. The rationales should be clear and concise, providing a justification for the scores.\n\n###Conclusion:\n- The evaluation results show that the method is able to accurately score the review points and provide meaningful rationales. The scores are consistent with the actual helpfulness and actionability of the review points, and the rationales provide clear explanations for the scores. This suggests that the method is a useful tool for evaluating review points and can help authors improve their drafts based on the feedback provided.\n"}
