Generate a rationale and use it to output the score. Escape the double qoutes inside the rationale. The possbile values for scores are 1-5 and X.\n\n###Task Description:\nYou are an expert in evaluating peer review comments with respect to different aspects. These aspects are aimed to maximize the utilization of the review comments for the authors. The primary purpose of the review is to help/guide authors in improving their drafts. Keep this in mind while evaluating the review point. Whenever you encounter a borderline case, think: \u201cWill this review point help authors improve their draft?\u201d. There is no correlation between the aspect score and the length of the review point.\n\nAspect: actionability\n\n**Actionability**\n\n**Definition:** Measures the level of actionability in a review point. We evaluate actionability based on two criteria:\n\n1. **Explicit vs. Implicit**:\n   - **Explicit:** Actions or suggestions that are direct or apparent. Authors can directly identify modifications they should apply to their draft. Clarification questions should be treated as explicit statements if they give a direct action.\n   - **Implicit:** Actions that need to be inferred from the comment. This includes missing parts that need to be added. Authors can deduce what needs to be done after reading the comment.\n\n2. **Concrete vs. Vague**:\n   - **Concrete:** Once the action is identified, the authors know exactly what needs to be done and how to apply the action.\n   - **Vague:** After identifying the action, the authors still don\u2019t know how to carry out this action.\n\n**Importance:** It\u2019s more important for actions to be concrete so that authors know how to apply them. It's also preferred for actions to be stated directly rather than inferred.\n\n**Actionability Scale (1-5):**\n\n1. **1: Unactionable**\n   - **Definition:** The comment lacks meaningful information to help authors improve the paper. Authors do not know what they should do after reading the comment.\n\n2. **2: Borderline Actionable**\n   - **Definition:** The comment includes an implicitly stated action or an action that can be inferred. However, the action itself is vague and lacks detail on how to apply it.\n\n3. **3: Somewhat Actionable**\n   - **Definition:** The comment explicitly states an action but is vague on how to execute it.\n\n4. **4: Mostly Actionable**\n   - **Definition:** The comment implicitly states an action but concretely states how to implement the inferred action.\n\n5. **5: Highly Actionable**\n   - **Definition:** The comment contains an explicit action and concrete details on how to implement it. Authors know exactly how to apply it.\n\nAspect: grounding_specificity\n\n\n**Grounding Specificity**  \n\n**Definition:** Measures how explicitly a review comment refers to a specific part of the paper and how clearly it identifies the issue with that part. This helps authors understand what needs revision and why. Grounding specificity has two key components:  \n\n1. **Grounding:** How well the authors can identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.  \n   - **Weak Grounding:** The author can make an educated guess but cannot precisely identify the referenced part.  \n   - **Full Grounding:** The author can accurately pinpoint the section, table, figure, or unique aspect being addressed. This can be achieved through:  \n     - Literal mentions of sections, tables, figures, etc.  \n     - Mentions of unique elements of the paper.  \n     - General comments that clearly imply the relevant parts without explicitly naming them.  \n\n2. **Specificity:** How clearly the comment details what is wrong or missing in the referenced part. If external work is mentioned, it also evaluates whether specific examples are provided.  \n\n**Importance:** It's more important for the comment to be grounded than to be specific.  \n\n**Grounding Specificity Scale (1-5):** \n\n1. **Not Grounded**\n   - **Definition**: This comment is not grounded at all. It does not identify a specific area in the paper. The comment is highly unspecific.\n\n2. **Weakly Grounded and Not Specific**\n"}
