The reviewer suggests comparing CPEF with another pre-trained model, such as ExpertBert, to demonstrate the advantage of CPEF\\'s pre-training module design. This claim is somewhat verifiable as it provides a logical reasoning for the unfairness of the comparison and suggests a potential solution. However, it lacks specific examples or references to support the claim fully, such as how ExpertBert would be a more appropriate comparison model. Therefore, the comment is rated as 3: Somewhat Verifiable.', 'verifiability_label': '3', 'helpfulness_rationale': 'The review comment identifies a specific issue with the fairness of the comparison presented in Figure 3, where CPEF is compared with PMEF under data scarcity conditions. The reviewer points out that PMEF lacks a pre-training module, which could affect the fairness of the comparison. The comment provides a clear and actionable suggestion to ensure fairness by comparing CPEF with another pre-trained model, such as ExpertBert, to showcase the advantage of CPEF\\'s innovative pre-training module design. This feedback is highly helpful as it guides the authors on how to improve the fairness and robustness of their experimental comparisons, leading to a more comprehensive evaluation of their model\\'s advantages.', 'helpfulness_label': '5'}"}
