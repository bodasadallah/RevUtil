Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded and specific, aligning with category 3.', 'grounding_specificity_label': '3', 'verifiability_rationale': 'The review point raises a question about the privacy preservation of the proposed approach compared to other federated learning approaches. It also questions whether privacy preservation is an issue in traffic signal control, suggesting that it might not be a suitable application for federated learning. However, the comment lacks specific examples or references to support the claim that privacy preservation is a concern in traffic signal control. Without such evidence or reasoning, the claim remains vague and difficult for the authors to address effectively. Therefore, the comment is considered borderline verifiable, as it provides some insight but lacks sufficient justification or evidence to fully substantiate the claim.', 'verifiability_label': '2', 'helpfulness_rationale': 'The review comment raises a question about the privacy preservation of the proposed approach compared to other federated learning approaches. It also questions whether privacy preservation is an issue in traffic signal control, suggesting that it might not be a suitable application for federated learning. While the comment identifies a potential weakness in the paper\\'s argument, it lacks specificity and actionable feedback. It does not provide guidance on how the authors might address these concerns or improve their explanation of privacy preservation. As a result, the comment is somewhat helpful, as it points out a potential area for improvement but does not offer detailed suggestions or examples. Therefore, it aligns with a score of 3.', 'helpfulness_label': '3'}"}
