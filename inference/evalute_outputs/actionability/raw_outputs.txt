You are an expert in evaluating peer review comments with respect to different aspects. These aspects are aimed to maximize the utilization of the review comments for the authors. The primary purpose of the review is to help/guide authors in improving their drafts. Keep this in mind while evaluating the review point. Whenever you encounter a borderline case, think: “Will this review point help authors improve their draft?”. There is no correlation between the aspect score and the length of the review point.

Aspect: actionability
Measures the level of actionability in the review point. We evaluate actionability according to two points: 
1. Is the action stated directly, or does the author need to infer it? (Explicit vs. Implicit). 
2.  After identifying the action, do you know how to apply it, or the action is vague? (Concrete vs. Vague)
- It’s more important for actions to be concrete so the authors know how to apply them. It’s also preferred that actions be stated directly rather than inferred.
Definitions:
Explicit:  Direct or apparent actions or suggestions. Authors can directly identify modifications that they should apply to their draft. Clarification questions should be treated as explicit statements if they give a direct action.
Implicit:  Actions that can be deduced. This can be in the form of questions that need to be addressed or missing parts that need to be added. Actions are not stated directly, but the authors can infer what needs to be done after reading the comment.
Concrete: After Identifying the action, the authors know exactly what needs to be done and how to apply the action.
Vague: After Identifying the action, the authors still don’t know how to carry out this action.
 Actionability is rated on a scale from 1-5, and we will now provide a definition for each.
1: Unactionable
Definition: The comment lacks any meaningful information to help the authors to improve the paper. After reading the comment, the authors do not know what they should do.
2: Borderline Actionable
Definition: The comment includes an implicitly stated action, or the action can be inferred. Further, the action itself is vague and lacks detail on how to apply it.
3: Somewhat Actionable
Definition: The comment explicitly states an action but is vague on how to execute it.
4: Mostly Actionable
Definition: The comment implicitly states an action but concretely states how to implement the inferred action.
5: Highly Actionable
Definition: The comment contains explicit action and concrete details on how to implement it. The authors know exactly how to apply it.

Evaluate the review based on the given definitions of the aspect(s) above. Output only the score.
Review Point: -W1) The paper evaluates only on one dataset and on one task. Results and conclusions would be stronger if the analysis were applied to more datasets and more tasks.

 everybody knows that the authors should compare their method with the state-of-the-art methods. The question is how to compare. The authors should compare the performance of their method with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the objective function value

Review Point: - The paper opens that learning long-range dependencies is important for powerful predictors. In the example of semantic segmentation I can see that this is actually happening, e.g., in the visualisations in table 3; but I am not sure if it is fully required. Probably the truth lies somewhere in between and I miss a discussion about this. If no form of locality with respect to the 2d image space is encoded in the graph structure, I suspect that prediction suddenly depends on the image size.

Review Point: 12. It would seem that this update would have to integrate over all possible environments in order to be meaningful, assuming that the true environment is not known at update time. Is that correct? I guess this was probably for space reasons, but the bolded sections in page 6 should really be broken out into \paragraphs — it's currently a huge wall of text.

The primary purpose of the review is to help/guide authors in improving their drafts. Keep this in mind while evaluating the review point. Whenever you encounter a borderline case, think: “Will this review point help authors improve their draft?”. There is no correlation between the aspect score and the length of the review point.

Aspect: actionability
Measures the level of actionability in the review point. We evaluate actionability according to two points: 
1. Is the action stated directly, or does the author need to infer it? (Explicit vs. Implicit). 
2.  After identifying the action, do you know how to apply it, or the action is vague? (Concrete vs. Vague)
- It’s more important for actions to be concrete so the authors know how to apply them. It’s also preferred that actions be stated directly rather than inferred.
Definitions:
Explicit:  Direct or apparent actions or suggestions. Authors can directly identify modifications that they should apply to their draft. Clarification questions should be treated as explicit statements if they give a direct action.
Implicit:  Actions that can be deduced. This can be in the form of questions that need to be addressed or missing parts that need to be added. Actions are not stated directly, but the authors can infer what needs to be done after reading the comment.
Concrete: After Identifying the action, the authors know exactly what needs to be done and how to apply the action.
Vague: After Identifying the action, the authors still don’t know how to carry out this action.
 Actionability is rated on a scale from 1-5, and we will now provide a definition for each.
1: Unactionable
Definition: The comment lacks any meaningful information to help the authors to improve the paper. After reading the comment, the authors do not know what they should do.
2: Borderline Actionable
Definition: The comment includes an implicitly stated action, or the action can be inferred. Further, the action itself is vague and lacks detail on how to apply it.
3: Somewhat Actionable
Definition: The comment explicitly states an action but is vague on how to execute it.
4: Mostly Actionable
Definition: The comment implicitly states an action but concretely states how to implement the inferred action.
5: Highly Actionable
Definition: The comment contains explicit action and concrete details on how to implement it. The authors know exactly how to apply it.

Review Point: - Also, since the dataset is artificially created, the dataset itself might have a lot of noise. For instance, the collected "pristine" set of tweets may not be pristine enough and might instead contain misinformation as well as out-of-context images. I would have liked to see more analysis around the quality of the collected dataset and the amount of noise it potentially has.

Review Point: 2.For the language-agnostic characters of entity representations, the paper has weak analysis on the alignment of entity representations. The authors could add more analysis about the multilingual alignment of entity representations and it would be better to have visualizations or case studies for different types of languages such as language family. We are also interested in whether entities from low-resourced languages are well aligned with the high-resourced ones.

Review Point: 2. Quantitive evaluation results in Figure 3 only reflect middle outputs rather than the final outputs. Figure 4 illustrates the comparison of final results with a single data sample.

Whenever you encounter a borderline case, think: “Will this review point help authors improve their draft?”. There is no correlation between the aspect score and the length of the review point.

Aspect: actionability
Measures the level of actionability in the review point. We evaluate actionability according to two points: 
1. Is the action stated directly, or does the author need to infer it? (Explicit vs. Implicit). 
2.  After identifying the action, do you know how to apply it, or the action is vague? (Concrete vs. Vague)
- It’s more important for actions to be concrete so the authors know how to apply them. It’s also preferred that actions be stated directly rather than inferred.
Definitions:
Explicit:  Direct or apparent actions or suggestions. Authors can directly identify modifications that they should apply to their draft. Clarification questions should be treated as explicit statements if they give a direct action.
Implicit:  Actions that can be deduced. This can be in the form of questions that need to be addressed or missing parts that need to be added. Actions are not stated directly, but the authors can infer what needs to be done after reading the comment.
Concrete: After Identifying the action, the authors know exactly what needs to be done and how to apply the action.
Vague: After Identifying the action, the authors still don’t know how to carry out this action.
 Actionability is rated on a scale from 1-5, and we will now provide a definition for each.
1: Unactionable
Definition: The comment lacks any meaningful information to help the authors to improve the paper. After reading the comment, the authors do not know what they should do.
2: Borderline Actionable
Definition: The comment includes an implicitly stated action, or the action can be inferred. Further, the action itself is vague and lacks detail on how to apply it.
3: Somewhat Actionable
Definition: The comment explicitly states an action but is vague on how to execute it.
4: Mostly Actionable
Definition: The comment implicitly states an action but concretely states how to implement the inferred action.
5: Highly Actionable
Definition: The comment contains explicit action and concrete details on how to implement it. The authors know exactly how to apply it.

Review Point: 2. The performance of FedPCL heavily relies on the selection of different pre-trained models, limiting its applications to more wide areas. As shown in Table 4, the model accuracy is quite sensitive to the pre-trained models. This work adequately addressed the limitations. The authors developed a lightweight federated learning framework to reduce the computation and communication costs and integrated pre-trained models to extract prototypes for federated aggregation. The is a new try for federated learning.

Review Point: 2. Experimental Evaluation 2.1. Ablations 2.1.1. The paper claims that âAnother distinction of our approach is the âpickingâ step â. However, this aspect is not ablated. 2.2. Experiments on CIFAR. The comparison on CIFAR is not convincing 2.2.1. The continual learning literature has extensive experiments on this dataset and the paper only compares to one approach (DEN). 2.2.2. It is unclear if DEN is correctly used/evaluated. It would have been more convincing if the authors used the same setup as in the DEN paper to make sure the comparison is fair/correct.

Review Point: 5. **(Performance of TTA methods)** This is an interesting observation, that using non-standard benchmarks breaks a lot of popular TTA methods. If the authors can evaluate TTA on more conditions of natural distribution shift, like WILDS [9], it could really strengthen the paper.

Review Point: - Line 226-238 seem to suggest that the authors selected sentences from raw data of these sources, but line 242-244 say these already have syntactic information. If I understand correctly, the data selected is a subset of Li et al. (2019a)’s dataset. If this is the case, I think this description can be revised, e.g. mentioning Li et al. (2019a) earlier, to make it clear and precise.
