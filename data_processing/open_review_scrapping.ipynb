       "  {'content': {'summary': {'value': 'The paper studied adversarial context bandits in a special setting where the losses of arm $a_i$ could be observed under all contexts when the algorithm plays arm $a_i$. The goal, like in classical adversarial bandit problems, is to minimize the regret compared to the loss of the best arm in hindsight. The paper focuses on the setting where the loss sequence is adversarial and the context is stochastic with an unknown distribution. A recent work of SZ [NeurIPS’23] designed an algorithm with *expected* regret of $\\\\tilde{O}(\\\\sqrt{KT})$ in this setting, where $K$ is the number of arms. This paper conducted a renewed analysis of the algorithm in SZ  [NeurIPS’23], and the main result is that the algorithm could actually achieve $\\\\tilde{O}(\\\\sqrt{KT})$ with high probability.\\n\\nThe main technique of the paper is heavily influenced by the previous work of SZ [NeurIPS’23]. In a nutshell, the low-regret guarantee of the algorithm crucially relies on the concentration of unbiased estimation of $E_{c}[\\\\ell_{t,c}(a)]$. Here, we cannot exactly compute the quantity since the distribution of the context is unknown. The key idea of SZ [NeurIPS’23] is to commit two steps for each EXP3 step and use one of them to estimate the distribution of the context. On top of that, this paper further utilized the weak dependency between epochs, and derived a martingale argument to get high-probability regret.'},\n",

       "    'weaknesses': {'value': \"Although I'm mostly supportive, I think I couldn’t strongly champion the paper due to the following reasons:\\n- The scope of contribution: although the paper does contain some neat technical observations, the contribution appears to be somehow incremental. After all, this is a new analysis of an existing algorithm, and the new analysis is not something that improves the previous bound (but instead is to get a high-probability bound). Again, I do acknowledge that such contributions are non-trivial. However, I do not think it’s enough for me to champion the paper.\\n- If the paper is going to be mainly accepted due to the techniques: then, I do not think the paper contains a substantial amount of new ideas. I appreciate the technical observations, and I agree that the steps are non-trivial. However, if the conceptual message is not as strong, and the merits of the paper mainly lie in the techniques, then the bar would inevitably be higher. \\n- For a conference like ICLR, the lack of experiments could be an issue. I am *not* letting this affect my score since I often advocate learning theory papers. However, I do want to raise this point since it is common for ML conferences to ask for experiments.\"},\n",
       "    'questions': {'value': \"- Should the definition of regret on page 3 be reversed? As in, you are subtracting the loss of the best arm with the loss of a policy, which should be a negative value (if with positive regret). This would change the decomposition of the regret on page 5 as well, but it seems nothing would affect the correctness.\\n- I think the full algorithm description of the algorithm in SZ [NeurIPS’23] (or some simpler version of the description) could be shown much earlier in the paper. This would be helpful for readers who are not familiar with the previous algorithm.\\n- Also, stating the main theorem in a preliminary section looks very non-standard to me. I’m not letting this affect my score, but please consider re-organizing this.\\n- The meaning of 'with high probability' was never explained in the paper -- as in, it could mean with probability $1-1/K$ or with probability $0.99$. I think your bound gives the former, and this should be stated explicitly.\"},\n",

      "abstract: {'value': 'Motivated by applications in online bidding and sleeping bandits, we examine the problem of contextual bandits with cross learning, where the learner observes the loss associated with the action across all possible contexts, not just the current round’s context. Our focus is on a setting where losses are chosen adversarially, and contexts are sampled i.i.d. from a specific distribution. This problem was first studied by  Balseiro et al. (2019), who proposed an algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret under the assumption that the context distribution is known in advance. However, this assumption is often unrealistic. To address this issue, Schneider & Zimmert (2023) recently proposed a new algorithm that achieves nearly optimal expected regret. It is well-known that expected regret can be significantly weaker than high-probability bounds. In this paper, we present a novel, in-depth analysis of their algorithm and demonstrate that it actually achieves near-optimal regret with $\\\\textit{high probability}$. There are steps in the original analysis by Schneider & Zimmert (2023) that lead only to an expected bound by nature. In our analysis, we introduce several new insights. Specifically, we make extensive use of the weak dependency structure between different epochs, which was overlooked in previous analyses. Additionally, standard martingale inequalities are not directly applicable, so we refine martingale inequalities to complete our analysis.'}\n",

How does this variable appear in the bound proved in this submission?\\n- (3) Could you please provide more evidence or further discussion of the applicability of the technique developed here so that we can better appreciate its potential?'},\n",
