    "Definition: The comment provides support for its claim, but one or more key elements are missing, such as specific examples, detailed explanations, or supporting references. It requires significant effort from the authors to follow the justification.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "The evaluative framework appears somewhat limited in scope. With considerations restricted to merely three Question-Answering tasks and two language models.\n",
    "The nature of the contribution with respect to ECE_sweep is not clearly described in the text. Concretely, this amounts to a way to choose the number of bins using data\n",
    "The approximation error is defined as the gap between the objective values, which is somehow ambiguous unless one has seen the values in the table.\n",
    "4: Mostly Verifiable\n",
    "Definition: The comment’s claim is sufficiently supported but has minor gaps. The reviewer could provide a more detailed explanation or reference to support their claims.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "The statistical analysis appears incorrect because the p-values reported for the t-tests do not align with standard thresholds for significance.\n",
    "The two used datasets are very related, where the input sequence is cocktail party speech, with one outputting the audio of each stream and the other producing the ASR output of each stream\n",
    "As the paper states in the intro, double Q-learning was developed to address the overestimation problem of Q-learning. However, this cannot really be seen directly from the results in the paper. The explanation given in the paper suggests that double Q learning resolves the overestimation problem by achieving a fast convergence rate.\n",
    "5: Fully Verifiable\n",
    "Definition: The claim is thoroughly supported by explicit, sufficient, and robust evidence. This can be done by:\n",
    "Clear and precise reasoning or explanation.\n",
    "References to external works/data, when applicable, are specific and relevant.\n",
    "Common-sense arguments are logically unassailable.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "The landscape results in parameter space looks very surprising because it has no assumptions on the generator and discriminator architecture except for enough representation. This looks surprising to me because usually, this kind of global optimization result for neural networks needs strong assumptions on the architecture.\n",
    "The first weakness of this work is that the wish list presented in the Introduction is a bit wider than the real techniques proposed by this work because the key difference of this work lies in the dynamic prior. The three properties were mentioned and basically solved by previous work like reference [21] and [27].\n",
    "The paper’s main idea of mixing transfer-based and query-based attacks is not novel. There have already been multiple papers based on this idea [9, 19]. This paper simply proposes to combine the best transfer-based attack (TIMI) and one of the best L2 query-based attacks (SimBA), which results in SimBA++, which is the main gain over the previous approaches reported in the paper.\n",
    " No Claim\n",
    "Definition: The comment does not contain any claim, opinion, or suggestion and consists of only factual, descriptive statements that do not require any justification.\n",
    "Clear and precise reasoning or explanation.\n",
    "References to external works/data, when applicable, are specific and relevant.\n",
    "Common-sense arguments are logically unassailable.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "How would this method perform empirically with multiple constraints?\n",
    "Entropy requires significant computation.\n",
    "This algorithm is slow, as it relies on an O(N²) algorithm.\n",

    "\"helpfulness\": '''Assign a subjective score to reflect the value of the review comment to the authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpfulness is rated on a scale from 1-5, and we will now provide a definition for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The comment is not helpful at all\n",
    "Definition: The comment fails to identify any meaningful weaknesses or suggest improvements, leaving the authors with no actionable feedback.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "The core idea of this paper is very simple and straightforward. Though the authors justify that they are the first to do it, I am unsure whether this work might count as a novel enough contribution to the NeurIPS community.\n",
    "It might be good to add more comments.\n",
    "In the experiments, the transfer tasks are too artificial.\n",
    "2. The comment is barely helpful\n",
    "Definition: The comment identifies a weakness or improvement area but is vague, lacks clarity, or provides minimal guidance, making it only slightly beneficial for the authors.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    " I wonder why learn the noisy data and clean data respectively in Algorithm 1, sample mini-batch d~D, \\hat{d} ~ \\hat{D}. Whether they can be fused for learning.\n",
    " For many of the datasets tested the improvement over other approaches or even the general adversarial approach is marginal.\n",
    " Section 5: It is unclear why the superspreader model is more realistic or more challenging than the uniform corruption.\n",
    "3. The comment is somewhat helpful\n",
    "Definition: The comment identifies weaknesses or areas for improvement but is incomplete or lacks depth. While the authors can gain some insights, the feedback does not fully address their needs for improving the draft.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "CRUCIAL: The evaluation is unclear. Were agents evaluated on held-out environments from the same task? Or on the N_env training environments? Either way seems fine, but it should be specified!\n",
    "What are the relative weights $m$ in 2.2.1? are they hyperparams? 2.2.2 seems to describe different schemes for using weights $m$ during inference, but aren't they needed during training? Are they fixed the same across the different setups?\n",
    "There is a gap between the proposed metric and method. Based on post-aggregation node similarity, they propose an aggregation similarity metric. However, the final 3-channel filterbank has nothing to do with the above metric.\n",
    "4. The comment is mostly helpful\n",
    "Definition: The comment provides clear and actionable feedback on weaknesses and areas for improvement, though it could be expanded or refined to be fully comprehensive and impactful.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    " It is hard to find the formal definition of the proposed CRS model. It seems to be the equation after line 175, but the authors did not say it explicitly.\n",
    "The reviewer would appreciate some discussion on the possibility of accelerating the proposed algorithm and whether it's optimal rate.\n",
    "The relationship between this work and the previous methods are not exposed. Since the idea of data augmentation in feature space is not new, I expect several papers closely related to this work. However, I cannot see which cited papers are closely related to this work and how it differs from them.\n",
    "5. The comment is highly helpful\n",
    "Definition: The comment thoroughly identifies weaknesses and offers detailed, actionable, and constructive suggestions that empower the authors to significantly improve their draft.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "I think there’s a problem with EQN 2. I believe you should multiply by 5 instead of 2.\n",
    "The abstract should act like a compact summary of your draft. The way it is not, it needs extra extra summarization. Don’t include a lot of details about your proposed algorithm there.\n",
    "The paper also overstates some claims which should be removed. For example on line 108 the paper says that \"these algorithms often diverge, likely due to the failure of this assumption\". Divergence in fitted Q-iteration could also be due to (for example) compounding errors of poor optimization of neural networks and their uncontrolled extrapolations.\n",
