Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions the \"ablation experiment\" and discusses the performance without reinforcement learning and dependency tree. This is a specific part of the paper, likely detailed in a section dedicated to experiments or results.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed (the ablation experiment).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment specifies that the tables do not list the cases where the dependency tree and reinforcement learning (RL) are not used. This is a clear indication of what is missing in the paper.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is specific because it details what is missing in the tables related to the ablation experiment.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed and specifies what needs to be addressed in that part.\n\n- **Label**: Based on the definitions, the appropriate label for this comment is \"5: Fully grounded and specific.\"\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: 3. It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: 1) The paper does not dig into the theory profs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions that the paper does not delve into \"the theory proofs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper where this issue is evident.\n- The authors are left without a clear indication of which part of the paper is being addressed. There is no literal mention of sections or unique identifiers that would help the authors pinpoint the exact location of the issue.\n- Therefore, the comment lacks grounding as it does not help the authors identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment highlights a general issue: the lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties. However, it does not provide details on what specific proofs or convergence properties are missing or how they should be addressed.\n- There is no mention of specific examples, references, or detailed suggestions that would guide the authors in addressing the issue.\n- As a result, the comment is unspecific in terms of what exactly needs to be improved or added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the authors cannot confidently determine which part of the paper the comment addresses, nor do they have clear guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the comment is best categorized as \"Not Grounded\" (Category 1).\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: - The paper claims the model generalizes to different knowledge but I think the substructure has to be represented as a sequence of words, e.g. it doesn't seem straightforward for me to use constituent parse as knowledge here. Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: The paper contains many empirical results and analyses, and it makes a concerted effort to put them together; but I still found it difficult to get the whole picture\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identify Grounding Level:**\n   - The comment mentions \"empirical results and analyses,\" which are specific components of a research paper. This suggests that the authors can likely identify the sections of the paper being addressed.\n   - The phrase \"the whole picture\" implies a broader issue with how these sections are integrated or presented, which might be inferred by the authors as a general comment on the coherence or synthesis of the results and analyses.\n\n2. **Determine Grounding Category:**\n   - Since the comment refers to specific parts of the paper (results and analyses) and the authors can likely infer the addressed sections, this indicates full grounding.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Identify Specificity Level:**\n   - The comment does not specify what exactly makes it difficult to get the whole picture. It lacks details on whether the issue is with clarity, organization, missing information, or something else.\n   - There are no specific examples or suggestions provided to address the issue.\n\n2. **Determine Specificity Category:**\n   - The comment is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong or missing in the results and analyses sections.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Final Evaluation:**\n  - The comment is fully grounded because it clearly addresses specific parts of the paper (results and analyses).\n  - The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed information on what needs to be improved.\n\n- **Label:**\n  - Based on the evaluation, the comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point:\n1) Additional reference regarding explainable NLP Datasets: \"Detecting and explaining unfairness in consumer contracts through memory networks\" (Ruggeri et al 2021)\n\n"}]}}

However, it discusses the potential improvement of the system's performance, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper that the authors can identify.\n2. **Inference by Authors**: The authors can infer that the comment addresses the section of the paper where the system's performance is discussed, even though it is not explicitly mentioned. This suggests weak grounding, as the authors have a hint about the relevant part but cannot pinpoint it with certainty.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that the use of feature engineering, particularly the feature set from Uto et al.

However, it is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong with the experiments or how they could be improved.\n\n- **Label**: According to the categories provided, this comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 3.In the ablation experiment, the performance without reinforcement learning dropped lower than without dependency tree.The two tables do not list the cases where dependency tree and RL are not used.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions the \"ablation experiment\" and discusses the performance without reinforcement learning and dependency tree. This is a specific part of the paper, likely detailed in a section dedicated to experiments or results.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed (the ablation experiment).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment specifies that the tables do not list the cases where the dependency tree and reinforcement learning (RL) are not used. This is a clear indication of what is missing in the paper.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is specific because it details what is missing in the tables related to the ablation experiment.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed and specifies what needs to be addressed in that part.\n\n- **Label**: Based on the definitions, the appropriate label for this comment is \"5: Fully grounded and specific.\"\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: - fairly straightforward extension of existing retrofitting work - would be nice to see some additional baselines .\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Grounding Evaluation**: \n   - The comment mentions a \"fairly straightforward extension of existing retrofitting work\" and suggests the addition of \"some additional baselines.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper. \n   - The authors might have a general idea that the comment pertains to the methodology or results sections where baselines are typically discussed, but there is no explicit mention or clear indication of a specific part of the paper.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks full grounding as it does not make any literal mentions or provide enough context for the authors to accurately identify the specific part being addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: \n   - The comment is not grounded because it does not identify a specific area in the paper. The authors cannot confidently determine which part the comment addresses.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Specificity Evaluation**: \n   - The comment suggests the addition of \"some additional baselines,\" which is a general suggestion. It does not specify what kind of baselines, how many, or in what context they should be added.\n   - There is no mention of specific examples or detailed explanation of what is wrong or missing in the current baselines.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks specificity as it does not provide detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: \n   - The comment is highly unspecific because it does not specify what needs to be addressed in the paper.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the comment is categorized as \"Not Grounded.\" It does not identify a specific area in the paper, and it is highly unspecific.\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: - it is always easier to show something (i.e. attention in seq2seq MTL) is not working, but the value would lie in finding out why it fails and changing the attention mechanism so that it works.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n1. **Identification of the Part Addressed:** The comment mentions \"attention in seq2seq MTL,\" which gives a hint about the area being addressed. This suggests that the authors have some idea about which part of the paper is being discussed, but it is not explicitly clear.\n2. **Grounding Level:** Since the authors can guess the general area (attention mechanism in seq2seq MTL) but cannot pinpoint the exact section or detail, this indicates weak grounding. The comment does not make literal mentions of sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that the authors can identify with certainty.\n\n**Specificity:**\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing:** The comment suggests that the value lies in understanding why the attention mechanism fails and how it can be modified. However, it does not provide specific details on what is wrong with the current mechanism or how it can be improved.\n2. **Specificity Level:** The comment lacks specificity because it does not offer concrete suggestions, examples, or detailed guidance on addressing the issue. It remains a general suggestion without actionable insights.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because the authors can only guess the general area being addressed without precise identification.\n- The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed guidance or specific examples for improvement.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"2: Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: - I was hoping to see some analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better in the evaluation, and how well that corresponds with the intuitive motivation of the authors.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Area**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. However, it refers to the \"morph-fitted embeddings\" and their performance in the evaluation, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper. This gives the authors a hint about the part of the paper being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: Since the authors can make an educated guess about which part of the paper is being addressed (the section discussing morph-fitted embeddings and their evaluation), but it is not explicitly mentioned, the comment is weakly grounded.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that there is a need for an analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better and how this aligns with the authors' intuitive motivation. This is a clear indication of what the reviewer feels is missing or needs to be addressed.\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed, namely the analysis of the performance of morph-fitted embeddings and its alignment with the authors' motivation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, but it is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed. Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is 3: Weakly grounded and specific.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point:\n- A number of claims from this paper would benefit from more in-depth analysis.\n\n"}]}}

Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: The paper contains many empirical results and analyses, and it makes a concerted effort to put them together; but I still found it difficult to get the whole picture\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identify Grounding Level:**\n   - The comment mentions \"empirical results and analyses,\" which are specific components of a research paper. This suggests that the authors can likely identify the sections of the paper being addressed.\n   - The phrase \"the whole picture\" implies a broader issue with how these sections are integrated or presented, which might be inferred by the authors as a general comment on the coherence or synthesis of the results and analyses.\n\n2. **Determine Grounding Category:**\n   - Since the comment refers to specific parts of the paper (results and analyses) and the authors can likely infer the addressed sections, this indicates full grounding.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Identify Specificity Level:**\n   - The comment does not specify what exactly makes it difficult to get the whole picture.

However, it does not provide any explicit identifiers such as section names, numbers, or unique content that would allow the authors to accurately identify the part being addressed.\n- Without any specific references or unique identifiers, the authors cannot determine with confidence which section or content the comment is addressing. This lack of clarity indicates that the comment is not grounded.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment provides a general critique about the space dedicated to assumptions and experimental results but does not specify what is wrong or missing.

Thus, the general summaries should be more readable.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions \"concept map extraction,\" which is a specific aspect of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it directly identifies the \"concept map extraction\" part of the paper.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment provides clear guidance or examples of what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment raises questions about the necessity of the current approach to concept map extraction and mentions potential issues with readability as the node number increases.

It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: - fairly straightforward extension of existing retrofitting work - would be nice to see some additional baselines .\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Grounding Evaluation**: \n   - The comment mentions a \"fairly straightforward extension of existing retrofitting work\" and suggests the addition of \"some additional baselines.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper. \n   - The authors might have a general idea that the comment pertains to the methodology or results sections where baselines are typically discussed, but there is no explicit mention or clear indication of a specific part of the paper.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks full grounding as it does not make any literal mentions or provide enough context for the authors to accurately identify the specific part being addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: \n   - The comment is not grounded because it does not identify a specific area in the paper.

However, it refers to the \"morph-fitted embeddings\" and their performance in the evaluation, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper. This gives the authors a hint about the part of the paper being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: Since the authors can make an educated guess about which part of the paper is being addressed (the section discussing morph-fitted embeddings and their evaluation), but it is not explicitly mentioned, the comment is weakly grounded.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that there is a need for an analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better and how this aligns with the authors' intuitive motivation.

The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019.

However, it refers to the \"morph-fitted embeddings\" and their performance in the evaluation, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper. This gives the authors a hint about the part of the paper being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: Since the authors can make an educated guess about which part of the paper is being addressed (the section discussing morph-fitted embeddings and their evaluation), but it is not explicitly mentioned, the comment is weakly grounded.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that there is a need for an analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better and how this aligns with the authors' intuitive motivation. This is a clear indication of what the reviewer feels is missing or needs to be addressed.\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed, namely the analysis of the performance of morph-fitted embeddings and its alignment with the authors' motivation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, but it is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed.

It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: 1) The paper does not dig into the theory profs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions that the paper does not delve into \"the theory proofs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper where this issue is evident.\n- The authors are left without a clear indication of which part of the paper is being addressed. There is no literal mention of sections or unique identifiers that would help the authors pinpoint the exact location of the issue.\n- Therefore, the comment lacks grounding as it does not help the authors identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment highlights a general issue: the lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties. However, it does not provide details on what specific proofs or convergence properties are missing or how they should be addressed.\n- There is no mention of specific examples, references, or detailed suggestions that would guide the authors in addressing the issue.\n- As a result, the comment is unspecific in terms of what exactly needs to be improved or added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the authors cannot confidently determine which part of the paper the comment addresses, nor do they have clear guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the comment is best categorized as \"Not Grounded\" (Category 1).\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point:\n1) The paper was extremely hard to follow.

Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions \"concept map extraction,\" which is a specific aspect of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it directly identifies the \"concept map extraction\" part of the paper.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing.

Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: 1.

Also what about the ablation studies of MCT without the adaptive metrics.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Parts**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 6\" and \"Table 1,\" which are specific parts of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which sections are being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the alignment between these two tables, which is a unique aspect that the authors can identify.\n\nBased on these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies specific parts of the paper.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that there is an issue with the alignment between the results in \"Table 6\" and \"Table 1.\" It also asks about the ablation studies of MCT without the adaptive metrics.\n2. **Clear Specification**: The comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed: the alignment issue between the tables and the need for ablation studies.\n\nGiven these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong or missing in the paper.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact parts of the paper being addressed and specifies what needs to be addressed in those parts.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: 1) The paper does not dig into the theory profs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions that the paper does not delve into \"the theory proofs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper where this issue is evident.\n- The authors are left without a clear indication of which part of the paper is being addressed. There is no literal mention of sections or unique identifiers that would help the authors pinpoint the exact location of the issue.\n- Therefore, the comment lacks grounding as it does not help the authors identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment highlights a general issue: the lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties. However, it does not provide details on what specific proofs or convergence properties are missing or how they should be addressed.\n- There is no mention of specific examples, references, or detailed suggestions that would guide the authors in addressing the issue.\n- As a result, the comment is unspecific in terms of what exactly needs to be improved or added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the authors cannot confidently determine which part of the paper the comment addresses, nor do they have clear guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the comment is best categorized as \"Not Grounded\" (Category 1).\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: 2. Would the use of feature engineering help in improving the performance? Uto et al. (2020)'s system reaches a QWK of 0.801 by using a set of hand-crafted features. Perhaps using Uto et al. (2020)'s same feature set could also improve the results of this work.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. However, it discusses the potential improvement of the system's performance, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper that the authors can identify.\n2. **Inference by Authors**: The authors can infer that the comment addresses the section of the paper where the system's performance is discussed, even though it is not explicitly mentioned. This suggests weak grounding, as the authors have a hint about the relevant part but cannot pinpoint it with certainty.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that the use of feature engineering, particularly the feature set from Uto et al. (2020), might improve the system's performance. This provides a clear direction for what could be addressed or explored further.\n2. **Mention of External Work**: The comment references Uto et al. (2020) and provides a specific example of a feature set that achieved a QWK of 0.801, adding specificity to the suggestion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Grounding**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify a specific part of the paper, but the authors can infer the relevant section.\n- **Specificity**: The comment is specific in suggesting the use of feature engineering and referencing Uto et al. (2020) as an example.\n\nGiven this analysis, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate because the comment lacks explicit grounding but provides specific guidance on what could be improved.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: 1) Is it necessary to treat concept map extraction like the way it is? On the one hand, many generic summarization systems build a similar knowledge graph and then generate summaries accordingly. On the other hand, with the increase of the node number, the concept map becomes growing hard to distinguish. Thus, the general summaries should be more readable.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions \"concept map extraction,\" which is a specific aspect of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it directly identifies the \"concept map extraction\" part of the paper.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment provides clear guidance or examples of what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment raises questions about the necessity of the current approach to concept map extraction and mentions potential issues with readability as the node number increases. However, it does not provide specific suggestions or detailed guidance on how to address these issues.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is under-specific because it highlights potential issues but lacks detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed. However, it is under-specific because it does not provide detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Final Categorization**: Based on the analysis, the comment is best categorized as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 3. It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point:\n- The writing should be improved. Some points in the paper is unclear to me.\n\n"}]}}

This suggests that the authors can likely identify the sections of the paper being addressed.\n   - The phrase \"the whole picture\" implies a broader issue with how these sections are integrated or presented, which might be inferred by the authors as a general comment on the coherence or synthesis of the results and analyses.\n\n2. **Determine Grounding Category:**\n   - Since the comment refers to specific parts of the paper (results and analyses) and the authors can likely infer the addressed sections, this indicates full grounding.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Identify Specificity Level:**\n   - The comment does not specify what exactly makes it difficult to get the whole picture.

This suggests that the authors have some idea about which part of the paper is being discussed, but it is not explicitly clear.\n2. **Grounding Level:** Since the authors can guess the general area (attention mechanism in seq2seq MTL) but cannot pinpoint the exact section or detail, this indicates weak grounding.

Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions the \"ablation experiment\" and discusses the performance without reinforcement learning and dependency tree. This is a specific part of the paper, likely detailed in a section dedicated to experiments or results.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed (the ablation experiment).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment specifies that the tables do not list the cases where the dependency tree and reinforcement learning (RL) are not used.

It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point:\n1: Poor writing and annotations are a little hard to follow.\n\n"}]}}

It does not specify what kind of baselines, how many, or in what context they should be added.\n   - There is no mention of specific examples or detailed explanation of what is wrong or missing in the current baselines.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks specificity as it does not provide detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: \n   - The comment is highly unspecific because it does not specify what needs to be addressed in the paper.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the comment is categorized as \"Not Grounded.\" It does not identify a specific area in the paper, and it is highly unspecific.\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: 3. It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: 4)Why the results of Table 6 is not aligned with Table 1 (MCT-pair)?

It identifies the exact parts of the paper being addressed and specifies what needs to be addressed in those parts.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: - The paper claims the model generalizes to different knowledge but I think the substructure has to be represented as a sequence of words, e.g. it doesn't seem straightforward for me to use constituent parse as knowledge here. Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: - The main weaknesses of the paper are the experiments, which is understandable for a short paper but I'd still expect it to be stronger.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or through unique aspects of the paper.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment mentions \"the experiments\" as the main weakness. This is a specific section of the paper, so the authors can likely identify which part is being addressed. Therefore, the comment is fully grounded because it explicitly refers to the experimental section.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment states that the experiments are a weakness but does not provide details on what specifically is lacking or how they could be improved. It lacks specific examples or suggestions for improvement. Therefore, the comment is under-specific.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the experimental section as the area of concern. However, it is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong with the experiments or how they could be improved.\n\n- **Label**: According to the categories provided, this comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 4) Not so useful information: While I appreciate the fleshing out of the assumptions, I find that dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results is a lot of space.\nrationale: *Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions \"dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results,\" which implies a reference to a specific part of the paper. However, it does not provide any explicit identifiers such as section names, numbers, or unique content that would allow the authors to accurately identify the part being addressed.\n- Without any specific references or unique identifiers, the authors cannot determine with confidence which section or content the comment is addressing. This lack of clarity indicates that the comment is not grounded.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment provides a general critique about the space dedicated to assumptions and experimental results but does not specify what is wrong or missing. It lacks details on why the space is considered excessive or how it could be improved.\n- There are no specific examples, suggestions, or detailed explanations provided, indicating a lack of specificity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the analysis, the comment is not grounded because the authors cannot identify with confidence which part of the paper is being addressed. Additionally, the comment is not specific as it does not detail what needs to be addressed or improved.\n- Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"1: Not Grounded.\"\n\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: - Using integrated gradients to measure the attribution has been studied in existing papers. The paper also proposes post-processing steps to filter out the \u201cfalse-positive\u201d neurons, however,  somehting needs to be done about this.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n1. **Identification of the Part Addressed:** The comment mentions \"using integrated gradients to measure the attribution\" and \"post-processing steps to filter out the 'false-positive' neurons.\" These references give the authors some indication of the areas being discussed, likely sections of the paper where these methods are described.\n2. **Grounding Level:** The authors have a hint about which part of the paper is being addressed due to the mention of specific methods and processes. However, the comment does not provide explicit references to sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that would allow for full grounding. Therefore, the grounding is weak.\n\n**Specificity:**\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing:** The comment states that \"something needs to be done about this\" regarding the post-processing steps but does not specify what exactly needs to be addressed or improved.\n2. **Specificity Level:** The comment lacks detail about what is wrong or missing in the post-processing steps. It does not provide specific suggestions or examples of what should be changed or considered. Thus, the comment is not specific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because the authors can guess the general area being addressed but cannot pinpoint it with confidence.\n- The comment is not specific because it fails to detail what needs to be addressed or improved.\n\nGiven this analysis, the label \"2: Weakly grounded and not specific\" is appropriate for this comment.\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point:\n- It's a bit unclear how the frame similarity factors and attributes similarity factors are selected.\n\n"}]}}

The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper. This allows the authors to accurately identify the section being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper's methodology. This further helps in grounding the comment.\n\nGiven these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that the authors should clarify the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training. It also suggests renaming a column in Table 1 and provides a detailed suggestion for restructuring the table with two big columns: 'Mixture training data' and 'Single source data'.\n2. **Clear Instructions**: The comment provides clear instructions on what changes are needed, making it specific.\n\nBased on these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong and provides concrete suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe review comment is both fully grounded and specific.

It does not identify a specific area in the paper. The comment is highly unspecific.\nExamples\nWhile the language has been improved, there are still some awkward phrases.

Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or through unique aspects of the paper.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment mentions \"the experiments\" as the main weakness. This is a specific section of the paper, so the authors can likely identify which part is being addressed. Therefore, the comment is fully grounded because it explicitly refers to the experimental section.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment states that the experiments are a weakness but does not provide details on what specifically is lacking or how they could be improved. It lacks specific examples or suggestions for improvement. Therefore, the comment is under-specific.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the experimental section as the area of concern. However, it is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong with the experiments or how they could be improved.\n\n- **Label**: According to the categories provided, this comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 1) The paper does not dig into the theory profs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions that the paper does not delve into \"the theory proofs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper where this issue is evident.\n- The authors are left without a clear indication of which part of the paper is being addressed. There is no literal mention of sections or unique identifiers that would help the authors pinpoint the exact location of the issue.\n- Therefore, the comment lacks grounding as it does not help the authors identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment highlights a general issue: the lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties. However, it does not provide details on what specific proofs or convergence properties are missing or how they should be addressed.\n- There is no mention of specific examples, references, or detailed suggestions that would guide the authors in addressing the issue.\n- As a result, the comment is unspecific in terms of what exactly needs to be improved or added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the authors cannot confidently determine which part of the paper the comment addresses, nor do they have clear guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the comment is best categorized as \"Not Grounded\" (Category 1).\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: 4)Why the results of Table 6 is not aligned with Table 1 (MCT-pair)? Also what about the ablation studies of MCT without the adaptive metrics.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Parts**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 6\" and \"Table 1,\" which are specific parts of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which sections are being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the alignment between these two tables, which is a unique aspect that the authors can identify.\n\nBased on these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies specific parts of the paper.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that there is an issue with the alignment between the results in \"Table 6\" and \"Table 1.\" It also asks about the ablation studies of MCT without the adaptive metrics.\n2. **Clear Specification**: The comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed: the alignment issue between the tables and the need for ablation studies.\n\nGiven these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong or missing in the paper.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact parts of the paper being addressed and specifies what needs to be addressed in those parts.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: - I was hoping to see some analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better in the evaluation, and how well that corresponds with the intuitive motivation of the authors.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Area**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. However, it refers to the \"morph-fitted embeddings\" and their performance in the evaluation, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper. This gives the authors a hint about the part of the paper being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: Since the authors can make an educated guess about which part of the paper is being addressed (the section discussing morph-fitted embeddings and their evaluation), but it is not explicitly mentioned, the comment is weakly grounded.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that there is a need for an analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better and how this aligns with the authors' intuitive motivation. This is a clear indication of what the reviewer feels is missing or needs to be addressed.\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed, namely the analysis of the performance of morph-fitted embeddings and its alignment with the authors' motivation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, but it is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed. Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is 3: Weakly grounded and specific.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: 3. It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point:\n- it is always easier to show something (i.e. attention in seq2seq MTL) is not working, but the value would lie in finding out why it fails and changing the attention mechanism so that it works.\n\n"}]}}

The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper.

Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: - fairly straightforward extension of existing retrofitting work - would be nice to see some additional baselines .\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Grounding Evaluation**: \n   - The comment mentions a \"fairly straightforward extension of existing retrofitting work\" and suggests the addition of \"some additional baselines.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper. \n   - The authors might have a general idea that the comment pertains to the methodology or results sections where baselines are typically discussed, but there is no explicit mention or clear indication of a specific part of the paper.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks full grounding as it does not make any literal mentions or provide enough context for the authors to accurately identify the specific part being addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: \n   - The comment is not grounded because it does not identify a specific area in the paper.

Thus, the general summaries should be more readable.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions \"concept map extraction,\" which is a specific aspect of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it directly identifies the \"concept map extraction\" part of the paper.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment provides clear guidance or examples of what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment raises questions about the necessity of the current approach to concept map extraction and mentions potential issues with readability as the node number increases. However, it does not provide specific suggestions or detailed guidance on how to address these issues.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is under-specific because it highlights potential issues but lacks detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed. However, it is under-specific because it does not provide detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Final Categorization**: Based on the analysis, the comment is best categorized as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point:\n- Relies on supplemental space to contain the paper. The paper is not truly independent given this problem (esp. S3.1 reference to Sup.

If the comment mentions some external work, it also measures whether it mentions specific examples. \n  Grounding and specificity is rated on a scale from 1-5, and we will now provide a definition for each.\n1: Not Grounded\nDefinition: This comment is not grounded at all. It does not identify a specific area in the paper. The comment is highly unspecific.\nExamples\nWhile the language has been improved, there are still some awkward phrases.

On the one hand, many generic summarization systems build a similar knowledge graph and then generate summaries accordingly. On the other hand, with the increase of the node number, the concept map becomes growing hard to distinguish. Thus, the general summaries should be more readable.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions \"concept map extraction,\" which is a specific aspect of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it directly identifies the \"concept map extraction\" part of the paper.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment provides clear guidance or examples of what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment raises questions about the necessity of the current approach to concept map extraction and mentions potential issues with readability as the node number increases. However, it does not provide specific suggestions or detailed guidance on how to address these issues.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is under-specific because it highlights potential issues but lacks detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed. However, it is under-specific because it does not provide detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Final Categorization**: Based on the analysis, the comment is best categorized as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: - it is always easier to show something (i.e. attention in seq2seq MTL) is not working, but the value would lie in finding out why it fails and changing the attention mechanism so that it works.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n1. **Identification of the Part Addressed:** The comment mentions \"attention in seq2seq MTL,\" which gives a hint about the area being addressed. This suggests that the authors have some idea about which part of the paper is being discussed, but it is not explicitly clear.\n2. **Grounding Level:** Since the authors can guess the general area (attention mechanism in seq2seq MTL) but cannot pinpoint the exact section or detail, this indicates weak grounding. The comment does not make literal mentions of sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that the authors can identify with certainty.\n\n**Specificity:**\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing:** The comment suggests that the value lies in understanding why the attention mechanism fails and how it can be modified. However, it does not provide specific details on what is wrong with the current mechanism or how it can be improved.\n2. **Specificity Level:** The comment lacks specificity because it does not offer concrete suggestions, examples, or detailed guidance on addressing the issue. It remains a general suggestion without actionable insights.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because the authors can only guess the general area being addressed without precise identification.\n- The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed guidance or specific examples for improvement.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"2: Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: 4) Not so useful information: While I appreciate the fleshing out of the assumptions, I find that dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results is a lot of space.\nrationale: *Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions \"dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results,\" which implies a reference to a specific part of the paper. However, it does not provide any explicit identifiers such as section names, numbers, or unique content that would allow the authors to accurately identify the part being addressed.\n- Without any specific references or unique identifiers, the authors cannot determine with confidence which section or content the comment is addressing. This lack of clarity indicates that the comment is not grounded.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment provides a general critique about the space dedicated to assumptions and experimental results but does not specify what is wrong or missing. It lacks details on why the space is considered excessive or how it could be improved.\n- There are no specific examples, suggestions, or detailed explanations provided, indicating a lack of specificity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the analysis, the comment is not grounded because the authors cannot identify with confidence which part of the paper is being addressed. Additionally, the comment is not specific as it does not detail what needs to be addressed or improved.\n- Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"1: Not Grounded.\"\n\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: 4)Why the results of Table 6 is not aligned with Table 1 (MCT-pair)?

It identifies the exact parts of the paper being addressed and specifies what needs to be addressed in those parts.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: - The paper claims the model generalizes to different knowledge but I think the substructure has to be represented as a sequence of words, e.g. it doesn't seem straightforward for me to use constituent parse as knowledge here. Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point:\n- I don't think the probabilistic connection is drawn very well. It doesn't seem to be made formally enough to take it as anything more than motivational which is fine, but I would suggest the authors either cement this connection more formally or adjust the language to clarify.\n\n"}]}}

The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained.

Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper.

There is no literal mention of sections or unique identifiers that would help the authors pinpoint the exact location of the issue.\n- Therefore, the comment lacks grounding as it does not help the authors identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment highlights a general issue: the lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties. However, it does not provide details on what specific proofs or convergence properties are missing or how they should be addressed.\n- There is no mention of specific examples, references, or detailed suggestions that would guide the authors in addressing the issue.\n- As a result, the comment is unspecific in terms of what exactly needs to be improved or added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the authors cannot confidently determine which part of the paper the comment addresses, nor do they have clear guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the comment is best categorized as \"Not Grounded\" (Category 1).\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: - it is always easier to show something (i.e. attention in seq2seq MTL) is not working, but the value would lie in finding out why it fails and changing the attention mechanism so that it works.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n1. **Identification of the Part Addressed:** The comment mentions \"attention in seq2seq MTL,\" which gives a hint about the area being addressed.

However, it does not provide any explicit identifiers such as section names, numbers, or unique content that would allow the authors to accurately identify the part being addressed.\n- Without any specific references or unique identifiers, the authors cannot determine with confidence which section or content the comment is addressing. This lack of clarity indicates that the comment is not grounded.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment provides a general critique about the space dedicated to assumptions and experimental results but does not specify what is wrong or missing. It lacks details on why the space is considered excessive or how it could be improved.\n- There are no specific examples, suggestions, or detailed explanations provided, indicating a lack of specificity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the analysis, the comment is not grounded because the authors cannot identify with confidence which part of the paper is being addressed. Additionally, the comment is not specific as it does not detail what needs to be addressed or improved.\n- Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"1: Not Grounded.\"\n\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: - The paper claims the model generalizes to different knowledge but I think the substructure has to be represented as a sequence of words, e.g. it doesn't seem straightforward for me to use constituent parse as knowledge here. Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: - it is always easier to show something (i.e. attention in seq2seq MTL) is not working, but the value would lie in finding out why it fails and changing the attention mechanism so that it works.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n1. **Identification of the Part Addressed:** The comment mentions \"attention in seq2seq MTL,\" which gives a hint about the area being addressed. This suggests that the authors have some idea about which part of the paper is being discussed, but it is not explicitly clear.\n2. **Grounding Level:** Since the authors can guess the general area (attention mechanism in seq2seq MTL) but cannot pinpoint the exact section or detail, this indicates weak grounding. The comment does not make literal mentions of sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that the authors can identify with certainty.\n\n**Specificity:**\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing:** The comment suggests that the value lies in understanding why the attention mechanism fails and how it can be modified. However, it does not provide specific details on what is wrong with the current mechanism or how it can be improved.\n2. **Specificity Level:** The comment lacks specificity because it does not offer concrete suggestions, examples, or detailed guidance on addressing the issue. It remains a general suggestion without actionable insights.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because the authors can only guess the general area being addressed without precise identification.\n- The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed guidance or specific examples for improvement.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"2: Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: - The main weaknesses of the paper are the experiments, which is understandable for a short paper but I'd still expect it to be stronger.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or through unique aspects of the paper.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment mentions \"the experiments\" as the main weakness. This is a specific section of the paper, so the authors can likely identify which part is being addressed. Therefore, the comment is fully grounded because it explicitly refers to the experimental section.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment states that the experiments are a weakness but does not provide details on what specifically is lacking or how they could be improved. It lacks specific examples or suggestions for improvement. Therefore, the comment is under-specific.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the experimental section as the area of concern. However, it is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong with the experiments or how they could be improved.\n\n- **Label**: According to the categories provided, this comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point:\n- The proposed solution is an incremental step considering the relaxation proposed by Guzman. et. al.

Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper.

Thus, the general summaries should be more readable.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions \"concept map extraction,\" which is a specific aspect of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it directly identifies the \"concept map extraction\" part of the paper.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment provides clear guidance or examples of what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment raises questions about the necessity of the current approach to concept map extraction and mentions potential issues with readability as the node number increases. However, it does not provide specific suggestions or detailed guidance on how to address these issues.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is under-specific because it highlights potential issues but lacks detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed. However, it is under-specific because it does not provide detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Final Categorization**: Based on the analysis, the comment is best categorized as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point:\n1.

The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained.

Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper.

Computing optimal transport distance is generally an expensive procedure.

Moreover, how do you compute exactly optimal transport, because the Sinkhorn method gives you a doubly stochastic matrix (how do you go from it to optimal transport?).\n\n"}]}}

On the one hand, many generic summarization systems build a similar knowledge graph and then generate summaries accordingly. On the other hand, with the increase of the node number, the concept map becomes growing hard to distinguish. Thus, the general summaries should be more readable.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions \"concept map extraction,\" which is a specific aspect of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it directly identifies the \"concept map extraction\" part of the paper.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment provides clear guidance or examples of what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment raises questions about the necessity of the current approach to concept map extraction and mentions potential issues with readability as the node number increases. However, it does not provide specific suggestions or detailed guidance on how to address these issues.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is under-specific because it highlights potential issues but lacks detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed. However, it is under-specific because it does not provide detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Final Categorization**: Based on the analysis, the comment is best categorized as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: - The paper claims the model generalizes to different knowledge but I think the substructure has to be represented as a sequence of words, e.g. it doesn't seem straightforward for me to use constituent parse as knowledge here. Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: 3. It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: - fairly straightforward extension of existing retrofitting work - would be nice to see some additional baselines .\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Grounding Evaluation**: \n   - The comment mentions a \"fairly straightforward extension of existing retrofitting work\" and suggests the addition of \"some additional baselines.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper. \n   - The authors might have a general idea that the comment pertains to the methodology or results sections where baselines are typically discussed, but there is no explicit mention or clear indication of a specific part of the paper.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks full grounding as it does not make any literal mentions or provide enough context for the authors to accurately identify the specific part being addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: \n   - The comment is not grounded because it does not identify a specific area in the paper. The authors cannot confidently determine which part the comment addresses.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Specificity Evaluation**: \n   - The comment suggests the addition of \"some additional baselines,\" which is a general suggestion. It does not specify what kind of baselines, how many, or in what context they should be added.\n   - There is no mention of specific examples or detailed explanation of what is wrong or missing in the current baselines.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks specificity as it does not provide detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: \n   - The comment is highly unspecific because it does not specify what needs to be addressed in the paper.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the comment is categorized as \"Not Grounded.\" It does not identify a specific area in the paper, and it is highly unspecific.\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: 1. The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper. This allows the authors to accurately identify the section being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper's methodology. This further helps in grounding the comment.\n\nGiven these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that the authors should clarify the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training. It also suggests renaming a column in Table 1 and provides a detailed suggestion for restructuring the table with two big columns: 'Mixture training data' and 'Single source data'.\n2. **Clear Instructions**: The comment provides clear instructions on what changes are needed, making it specific.\n\nBased on these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong and provides concrete suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe review comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed (Table 1) and provides detailed instructions on what needs to be changed and how.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point:\n\u2022 I think epoch-wise analysis, especially for finite sum settings, could help provide insights into behaviors of optimization algorithms. For instance, it may enable to further investigate effect of batch size or different sampling strategies with respect to progress of the algorithms after every full pass of data. This may also help with comparative analysis of deterministic and stochastic methods.\n\n"}]}}

The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper. This allows the authors to accurately identify the section being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper's methodology. This further helps in grounding the comment.\n\nGiven these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that the authors should clarify the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training. It also suggests renaming a column in Table 1 and provides a detailed suggestion for restructuring the table with two big columns: 'Mixture training data' and 'Single source data'.\n2. **Clear Instructions**: The comment provides clear instructions on what changes are needed, making it specific.\n\nBased on these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong and provides concrete suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe review comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed (Table 1) and provides detailed instructions on what needs to be changed and how.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: - I was hoping to see some analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better in the evaluation, and how well that corresponds with the intuitive motivation of the authors.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Area**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. However, it refers to the \"morph-fitted embeddings\" and their performance in the evaluation, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper. This gives the authors a hint about the part of the paper being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: Since the authors can make an educated guess about which part of the paper is being addressed (the section discussing morph-fitted embeddings and their evaluation), but it is not explicitly mentioned, the comment is weakly grounded.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that there is a need for an analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better and how this aligns with the authors' intuitive motivation. This is a clear indication of what the reviewer feels is missing or needs to be addressed.\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed, namely the analysis of the performance of morph-fitted embeddings and its alignment with the authors' motivation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, but it is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed. Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is 3: Weakly grounded and specific.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: 3. It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: 1) Is it necessary to treat concept map extraction like the way it is? On the one hand, many generic summarization systems build a similar knowledge graph and then generate summaries accordingly. On the other hand, with the increase of the node number, the concept map becomes growing hard to distinguish. Thus, the general summaries should be more readable.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions \"concept map extraction,\" which is a specific aspect of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it directly identifies the \"concept map extraction\" part of the paper.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment provides clear guidance or examples of what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment raises questions about the necessity of the current approach to concept map extraction and mentions potential issues with readability as the node number increases. However, it does not provide specific suggestions or detailed guidance on how to address these issues.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is under-specific because it highlights potential issues but lacks detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed. However, it is under-specific because it does not provide detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Final Categorization**: Based on the analysis, the comment is best categorized as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 1) The paper does not dig into the theory profs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions that the paper does not delve into \"the theory proofs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper where this issue is evident.\n- The authors are left without a clear indication of which part of the paper is being addressed. There is no literal mention of sections or unique identifiers that would help the authors pinpoint the exact location of the issue.\n- Therefore, the comment lacks grounding as it does not help the authors identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment highlights a general issue: the lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties. However, it does not provide details on what specific proofs or convergence properties are missing or how they should be addressed.\n- There is no mention of specific examples, references, or detailed suggestions that would guide the authors in addressing the issue.\n- As a result, the comment is unspecific in terms of what exactly needs to be improved or added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the authors cannot confidently determine which part of the paper the comment addresses, nor do they have clear guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the comment is best categorized as \"Not Grounded\" (Category 1).\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point:\n2.

It does not specify what kind of baselines, how many, or in what context they should be added.\n   - There is no mention of specific examples or detailed explanation of what is wrong or missing in the current baselines.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks specificity as it does not provide detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: \n   - The comment is highly unspecific because it does not specify what needs to be addressed in the paper.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the comment is categorized as \"Not Grounded.\" It does not identify a specific area in the paper, and it is highly unspecific.\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: - it is always easier to show something (i.e. attention in seq2seq MTL) is not working, but the value would lie in finding out why it fails and changing the attention mechanism so that it works.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n1. **Identification of the Part Addressed:** The comment mentions \"attention in seq2seq MTL,\" which gives a hint about the area being addressed. This suggests that the authors have some idea about which part of the paper is being discussed, but it is not explicitly clear.\n2. **Grounding Level:** Since the authors can guess the general area (attention mechanism in seq2seq MTL) but cannot pinpoint the exact section or detail, this indicates weak grounding. The comment does not make literal mentions of sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that the authors can identify with certainty.\n\n**Specificity:**\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing:** The comment suggests that the value lies in understanding why the attention mechanism fails and how it can be modified. However, it does not provide specific details on what is wrong with the current mechanism or how it can be improved.\n2. **Specificity Level:** The comment lacks specificity because it does not offer concrete suggestions, examples, or detailed guidance on addressing the issue. It remains a general suggestion without actionable insights.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because the authors can only guess the general area being addressed without precise identification.\n- The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed guidance or specific examples for improvement.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"2: Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: - I was hoping to see some analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better in the evaluation, and how well that corresponds with the intuitive motivation of the authors.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Area**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper.

Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper.

It also suggests renaming a column in Table 1 and provides a detailed suggestion for restructuring the table with two big columns: 'Mixture training data' and 'Single source data'.\n2. **Clear Instructions**: The comment provides clear instructions on what changes are needed, making it specific.\n\nBased on these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong and provides concrete suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe review comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed (Table 1) and provides detailed instructions on what needs to be changed and how.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: 4) Not so useful information: While I appreciate the fleshing out of the assumptions, I find that dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results is a lot of space.\nrationale: *Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions \"dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results,\" which implies a reference to a specific part of the paper. However, it does not provide any explicit identifiers such as section names, numbers, or unique content that would allow the authors to accurately identify the part being addressed.\n- Without any specific references or unique identifiers, the authors cannot determine with confidence which section or content the comment is addressing. This lack of clarity indicates that the comment is not grounded.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment provides a general critique about the space dedicated to assumptions and experimental results but does not specify what is wrong or missing.

Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or through unique aspects of the paper.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment mentions \"the experiments\" as the main weakness. This is a specific section of the paper, so the authors can likely identify which part is being addressed. Therefore, the comment is fully grounded because it explicitly refers to the experimental section.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment states that the experiments are a weakness but does not provide details on what specifically is lacking or how they could be improved. It lacks specific examples or suggestions for improvement. Therefore, the comment is under-specific.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the experimental section as the area of concern. However, it is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong with the experiments or how they could be improved.\n\n- **Label**: According to the categories provided, this comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 3.

Would the use of feature engineering help in improving the performance? Uto et al. (2020)'s system reaches a QWK of 0.801 by using a set of hand-crafted features. Perhaps using Uto et al. (2020)'s same feature set could also improve the results of this work.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. However, it discusses the potential improvement of the system's performance, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper that the authors can identify.\n2. **Inference by Authors**: The authors can infer that the comment addresses the section of the paper where the system's performance is discussed, even though it is not explicitly mentioned. This suggests weak grounding, as the authors have a hint about the relevant part but cannot pinpoint it with certainty.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that the use of feature engineering, particularly the feature set from Uto et al. (2020), might improve the system's performance. This provides a clear direction for what could be addressed or explored further.\n2. **Mention of External Work**: The comment references Uto et al. (2020) and provides a specific example of a feature set that achieved a QWK of 0.801, adding specificity to the suggestion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Grounding**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify a specific part of the paper, but the authors can infer the relevant section.\n- **Specificity**: The comment is specific in suggesting the use of feature engineering and referencing Uto et al. (2020) as an example.\n\nGiven this analysis, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate because the comment lacks explicit grounding but provides specific guidance on what could be improved.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: - fairly straightforward extension of existing retrofitting work - would be nice to see some additional baselines .\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Grounding Evaluation**: \n   - The comment mentions a \"fairly straightforward extension of existing retrofitting work\" and suggests the addition of \"some additional baselines.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper. \n   - The authors might have a general idea that the comment pertains to the methodology or results sections where baselines are typically discussed, but there is no explicit mention or clear indication of a specific part of the paper.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks full grounding as it does not make any literal mentions or provide enough context for the authors to accurately identify the specific part being addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: \n   - The comment is not grounded because it does not identify a specific area in the paper. The authors cannot confidently determine which part the comment addresses.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Specificity Evaluation**: \n   - The comment suggests the addition of \"some additional baselines,\" which is a general suggestion. It does not specify what kind of baselines, how many, or in what context they should be added.\n   - There is no mention of specific examples or detailed explanation of what is wrong or missing in the current baselines.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks specificity as it does not provide detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: \n   - The comment is highly unspecific because it does not specify what needs to be addressed in the paper.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the comment is categorized as \"Not Grounded.\" It does not identify a specific area in the paper, and it is highly unspecific.\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: 1) Is it necessary to treat concept map extraction like the way it is? On the one hand, many generic summarization systems build a similar knowledge graph and then generate summaries accordingly. On the other hand, with the increase of the node number, the concept map becomes growing hard to distinguish. Thus, the general summaries should be more readable.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions \"concept map extraction,\" which is a specific aspect of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it directly identifies the \"concept map extraction\" part of the paper.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment provides clear guidance or examples of what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment raises questions about the necessity of the current approach to concept map extraction and mentions potential issues with readability as the node number increases. However, it does not provide specific suggestions or detailed guidance on how to address these issues.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is under-specific because it highlights potential issues but lacks detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed. However, it is under-specific because it does not provide detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Final Categorization**: Based on the analysis, the comment is best categorized as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 1. The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper. This allows the authors to accurately identify the section being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper's methodology. This further helps in grounding the comment.\n\nGiven these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that the authors should clarify the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training. It also suggests renaming a column in Table 1 and provides a detailed suggestion for restructuring the table with two big columns: 'Mixture training data' and 'Single source data'.\n2. **Clear Instructions**: The comment provides clear instructions on what changes are needed, making it specific.\n\nBased on these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong and provides concrete suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe review comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed (Table 1) and provides detailed instructions on what needs to be changed and how.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: 3. It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point:\n- the authors leverage the complexity of checking on the Witness oracle, which is \"polynomial time\" in the tabular case. This feels like not addressing the problem in a direct way.\n\n"}]}}

Its potential to generalize to other reasoning or generation tasks or more advanced models, such as vicunna or alpaca, remains a subject of inquiry.\n\n"}]}}

However, the comment does not provide explicit references to sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that would allow for full grounding. Therefore, the grounding is weak.\n\n**Specificity:**\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing:** The comment states that \"something needs to be done about this\" regarding the post-processing steps but does not specify what exactly needs to be addressed or improved.\n2. **Specificity Level:** The comment lacks detail about what is wrong or missing in the post-processing steps. It does not provide specific suggestions or examples of what should be changed or considered. Thus, the comment is not specific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because the authors can guess the general area being addressed but cannot pinpoint it with confidence.\n- The comment is not specific because it fails to detail what needs to be addressed or improved.\n\nGiven this analysis, the label \"2: Weakly grounded and not specific\" is appropriate for this comment.\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: 1. The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper. This allows the authors to accurately identify the section being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper's methodology. This further helps in grounding the comment.\n\nGiven these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that the authors should clarify the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training. It also suggests renaming a column in Table 1 and provides a detailed suggestion for restructuring the table with two big columns: 'Mixture training data' and 'Single source data'.\n2. **Clear Instructions**: The comment provides clear instructions on what changes are needed, making it specific.\n\nBased on these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong and provides concrete suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe review comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed (Table 1) and provides detailed instructions on what needs to be changed and how.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: - I was hoping to see some analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better in the evaluation, and how well that corresponds with the intuitive motivation of the authors.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Area**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. However, it refers to the \"morph-fitted embeddings\" and their performance in the evaluation, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper. This gives the authors a hint about the part of the paper being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: Since the authors can make an educated guess about which part of the paper is being addressed (the section discussing morph-fitted embeddings and their evaluation), but it is not explicitly mentioned, the comment is weakly grounded.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that there is a need for an analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better and how this aligns with the authors' intuitive motivation. This is a clear indication of what the reviewer feels is missing or needs to be addressed.\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed, namely the analysis of the performance of morph-fitted embeddings and its alignment with the authors' motivation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, but it is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed. Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is 3: Weakly grounded and specific.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: The paper contains many empirical results and analyses, and it makes a concerted effort to put them together; but I still found it difficult to get the whole picture\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identify Grounding Level:**\n   - The comment mentions \"empirical results and analyses,\" which are specific components of a research paper. This suggests that the authors can likely identify the sections of the paper being addressed.\n   - The phrase \"the whole picture\" implies a broader issue with how these sections are integrated or presented, which might be inferred by the authors as a general comment on the coherence or synthesis of the results and analyses.\n\n2. **Determine Grounding Category:**\n   - Since the comment refers to specific parts of the paper (results and analyses) and the authors can likely infer the addressed sections, this indicates full grounding.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Identify Specificity Level:**\n   - The comment does not specify what exactly makes it difficult to get the whole picture. It lacks details on whether the issue is with clarity, organization, missing information, or something else.\n   - There are no specific examples or suggestions provided to address the issue.\n\n2. **Determine Specificity Category:**\n   - The comment is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong or missing in the results and analyses sections.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Final Evaluation:**\n  - The comment is fully grounded because it clearly addresses specific parts of the paper (results and analyses).\n  - The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed information on what needs to be improved.\n\n- **Label:**\n  - Based on the evaluation, the comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 1) The paper does not dig into the theory profs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions that the paper does not delve into \"the theory proofs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper where this issue is evident.\n- The authors are left without a clear indication of which part of the paper is being addressed. There is no literal mention of sections or unique identifiers that would help the authors pinpoint the exact location of the issue.\n- Therefore, the comment lacks grounding as it does not help the authors identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment highlights a general issue: the lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties. However, it does not provide details on what specific proofs or convergence properties are missing or how they should be addressed.\n- There is no mention of specific examples, references, or detailed suggestions that would guide the authors in addressing the issue.\n- As a result, the comment is unspecific in terms of what exactly needs to be improved or added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the authors cannot confidently determine which part of the paper the comment addresses, nor do they have clear guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the comment is best categorized as \"Not Grounded\" (Category 1).\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point:\n- The proposed objective Eq. 2 in line 128, requires the optimisation over both the parameters of the transformation \\phi and the shared model \\theta_S. The effect on the number of parameters vs. prior work eg. AlignFlow (Grover et. al. 2019) has not been discussed clearly.\n\n"}]}}

Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions the \"ablation experiment\" and discusses the performance without reinforcement learning and dependency tree.

A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment specifies that the tables do not list the cases where the dependency tree and reinforcement learning (RL) are not used.

This suggests that the authors have some idea about which part of the paper is being discussed, but it is not explicitly clear.\n2. **Grounding Level:** Since the authors can guess the general area (attention mechanism in seq2seq MTL) but cannot pinpoint the exact section or detail, this indicates weak grounding. The comment does not make literal mentions of sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that the authors can identify with certainty.\n\n**Specificity:**\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing:** The comment suggests that the value lies in understanding why the attention mechanism fails and how it can be modified. However, it does not provide specific details on what is wrong with the current mechanism or how it can be improved.\n2. **Specificity Level:** The comment lacks specificity because it does not offer concrete suggestions, examples, or detailed guidance on addressing the issue.

The authors cannot confidently determine which part the comment addresses.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Specificity Evaluation**: \n   - The comment suggests the addition of \"some additional baselines,\" which is a general suggestion. It does not specify what kind of baselines, how many, or in what context they should be added.\n   - There is no mention of specific examples or detailed explanation of what is wrong or missing in the current baselines.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks specificity as it does not provide detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: \n   - The comment is highly unspecific because it does not specify what needs to be addressed in the paper.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the comment is categorized as \"Not Grounded.\" It does not identify a specific area in the paper, and it is highly unspecific.\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: - The paper claims the model generalizes to different knowledge but I think the substructure has to be represented as a sequence of words, e.g. it doesn't seem straightforward for me to use constituent parse as knowledge here. Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: - The main weaknesses of the paper are the experiments, which is understandable for a short paper but I'd still expect it to be stronger.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or through unique aspects of the paper.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment mentions \"the experiments\" as the main weakness. This is a specific section of the paper, so the authors can likely identify which part is being addressed. Therefore, the comment is fully grounded because it explicitly refers to the experimental section.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment states that the experiments are a weakness but does not provide details on what specifically is lacking or how they could be improved. It lacks specific examples or suggestions for improvement. Therefore, the comment is under-specific.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the experimental section as the area of concern. However, it is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong with the experiments or how they could be improved.\n\n- **Label**: According to the categories provided, this comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point:\n- line 47 - 48 \"over-parametrization invariably overfits the data and results in worse performance\": over-parameterization seems to be very helpful for supervised learning of deep neural networks in practice ...

It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: The paper contains many empirical results and analyses, and it makes a concerted effort to put them together; but I still found it difficult to get the whole picture\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identify Grounding Level:**\n   - The comment mentions \"empirical results and analyses,\" which are specific components of a research paper. This suggests that the authors can likely identify the sections of the paper being addressed.\n   - The phrase \"the whole picture\" implies a broader issue with how these sections are integrated or presented, which might be inferred by the authors as a general comment on the coherence or synthesis of the results and analyses.\n\n2. **Determine Grounding Category:**\n   - Since the comment refers to specific parts of the paper (results and analyses) and the authors can likely infer the addressed sections, this indicates full grounding.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Identify Specificity Level:**\n   - The comment does not specify what exactly makes it difficult to get the whole picture. It lacks details on whether the issue is with clarity, organization, missing information, or something else.\n   - There are no specific examples or suggestions provided to address the issue.\n\n2. **Determine Specificity Category:**\n   - The comment is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong or missing in the results and analyses sections.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Final Evaluation:**\n  - The comment is fully grounded because it clearly addresses specific parts of the paper (results and analyses).\n  - The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed information on what needs to be improved.\n\n- **Label:**\n  - Based on the evaluation, the comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 4) Not so useful information: While I appreciate the fleshing out of the assumptions, I find that dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results is a lot of space.\nrationale: *Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions \"dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results,\" which implies a reference to a specific part of the paper. However, it does not provide any explicit identifiers such as section names, numbers, or unique content that would allow the authors to accurately identify the part being addressed.\n- Without any specific references or unique identifiers, the authors cannot determine with confidence which section or content the comment is addressing. This lack of clarity indicates that the comment is not grounded.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment provides a general critique about the space dedicated to assumptions and experimental results but does not specify what is wrong or missing. It lacks details on why the space is considered excessive or how it could be improved.\n- There are no specific examples, suggestions, or detailed explanations provided, indicating a lack of specificity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the analysis, the comment is not grounded because the authors cannot identify with confidence which part of the paper is being addressed. Additionally, the comment is not specific as it does not detail what needs to be addressed or improved.\n- Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"1: Not Grounded.\"\n\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: - The paper claims the model generalizes to different knowledge but I think the substructure has to be represented as a sequence of words, e.g. it doesn't seem straightforward for me to use constituent parse as knowledge here.

It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: 4)Why the results of Table 6 is not aligned with Table 1 (MCT-pair)?

Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or through unique aspects of the paper.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment mentions \"the experiments\" as the main weakness. This is a specific section of the paper, so the authors can likely identify which part is being addressed. Therefore, the comment is fully grounded because it explicitly refers to the experimental section.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment states that the experiments are a weakness but does not provide details on what specifically is lacking or how they could be improved. It lacks specific examples or suggestions for improvement. Therefore, the comment is under-specific.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the experimental section as the area of concern.

Would the use of feature engineering help in improving the performance? Uto et al. (2020)'s system reaches a QWK of 0.801 by using a set of hand-crafted features. Perhaps using Uto et al. (2020)'s same feature set could also improve the results of this work.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. However, it discusses the potential improvement of the system's performance, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper that the authors can identify.\n2. **Inference by Authors**: The authors can infer that the comment addresses the section of the paper where the system's performance is discussed, even though it is not explicitly mentioned. This suggests weak grounding, as the authors have a hint about the relevant part but cannot pinpoint it with certainty.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that the use of feature engineering, particularly the feature set from Uto et al. (2020), might improve the system's performance. This provides a clear direction for what could be addressed or explored further.\n2. **Mention of External Work**: The comment references Uto et al. (2020) and provides a specific example of a feature set that achieved a QWK of 0.801, adding specificity to the suggestion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Grounding**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify a specific part of the paper, but the authors can infer the relevant section.\n- **Specificity**: The comment is specific in suggesting the use of feature engineering and referencing Uto et al. (2020) as an example.\n\nGiven this analysis, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate because the comment lacks explicit grounding but provides specific guidance on what could be improved.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: 4) Not so useful information: While I appreciate the fleshing out of the assumptions, I find that dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results is a lot of space.\nrationale: *Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions \"dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results,\" which implies a reference to a specific part of the paper.

This suggests that the authors have some idea about which part of the paper is being discussed, but it is not explicitly clear.\n2. **Grounding Level:** Since the authors can guess the general area (attention mechanism in seq2seq MTL) but cannot pinpoint the exact section or detail, this indicates weak grounding. The comment does not make literal mentions of sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that the authors can identify with certainty.\n\n**Specificity:**\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing:** The comment suggests that the value lies in understanding why the attention mechanism fails and how it can be modified. However, it does not provide specific details on what is wrong with the current mechanism or how it can be improved.\n2. **Specificity Level:** The comment lacks specificity because it does not offer concrete suggestions, examples, or detailed guidance on addressing the issue. It remains a general suggestion without actionable insights.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because the authors can only guess the general area being addressed without precise identification.\n- The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed guidance or specific examples for improvement.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"2: Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point:\n1.

Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: The paper contains many empirical results and analyses, and it makes a concerted effort to put them together; but I still found it difficult to get the whole picture\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identify Grounding Level:**\n   - The comment mentions \"empirical results and analyses,\" which are specific components of a research paper. This suggests that the authors can likely identify the sections of the paper being addressed.\n   - The phrase \"the whole picture\" implies a broader issue with how these sections are integrated or presented, which might be inferred by the authors as a general comment on the coherence or synthesis of the results and analyses.\n\n2. **Determine Grounding Category:**\n   - Since the comment refers to specific parts of the paper (results and analyses) and the authors can likely infer the addressed sections, this indicates full grounding.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Identify Specificity Level:**\n   - The comment does not specify what exactly makes it difficult to get the whole picture. It lacks details on whether the issue is with clarity, organization, missing information, or something else.\n   - There are no specific examples or suggestions provided to address the issue.\n\n2. **Determine Specificity Category:**\n   - The comment is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong or missing in the results and analyses sections.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Final Evaluation:**\n  - The comment is fully grounded because it clearly addresses specific parts of the paper (results and analyses).\n  - The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed information on what needs to be improved.\n\n- **Label:**\n  - Based on the evaluation, the comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 4) Not so useful information: While I appreciate the fleshing out of the assumptions, I find that dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results is a lot of space.\nrationale: *Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions \"dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results,\" which implies a reference to a specific part of the paper. However, it does not provide any explicit identifiers such as section names, numbers, or unique content that would allow the authors to accurately identify the part being addressed.\n- Without any specific references or unique identifiers, the authors cannot determine with confidence which section or content the comment is addressing. This lack of clarity indicates that the comment is not grounded.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment provides a general critique about the space dedicated to assumptions and experimental results but does not specify what is wrong or missing. It lacks details on why the space is considered excessive or how it could be improved.\n- There are no specific examples, suggestions, or detailed explanations provided, indicating a lack of specificity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the analysis, the comment is not grounded because the authors cannot identify with confidence which part of the paper is being addressed. Additionally, the comment is not specific as it does not detail what needs to be addressed or improved.\n- Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"1: Not Grounded.\"\n\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: 1. The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper. This allows the authors to accurately identify the section being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper's methodology. This further helps in grounding the comment.\n\nGiven these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that the authors should clarify the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training. It also suggests renaming a column in Table 1 and provides a detailed suggestion for restructuring the table with two big columns: 'Mixture training data' and 'Single source data'.\n2. **Clear Instructions**: The comment provides clear instructions on what changes are needed, making it specific.\n\nBased on these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong and provides concrete suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe review comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed (Table 1) and provides detailed instructions on what needs to be changed and how.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point:\n3. I think figure 6C is a bit awkward, it implies negative rates, which is not the case, I would suggest using a second y-axis or another visualization which is more physically accurate.\n\n"}]}}

Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or through unique aspects of the paper.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment mentions \"the experiments\" as the main weakness. This is a specific section of the paper, so the authors can likely identify which part is being addressed. Therefore, the comment is fully grounded because it explicitly refers to the experimental section.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment states that the experiments are a weakness but does not provide details on what specifically is lacking or how they could be improved. It lacks specific examples or suggestions for improvement. Therefore, the comment is under-specific.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the experimental section as the area of concern. However, it is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong with the experiments or how they could be improved.\n\n- **Label**: According to the categories provided, this comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 3.In the ablation experiment, the performance without reinforcement learning dropped lower than without dependency tree.The two tables do not list the cases where dependency tree and RL are not used.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions the \"ablation experiment\" and discusses the performance without reinforcement learning and dependency tree. This is a specific part of the paper, likely detailed in a section dedicated to experiments or results.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed (the ablation experiment).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment specifies that the tables do not list the cases where the dependency tree and reinforcement learning (RL) are not used. This is a clear indication of what is missing in the paper.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is specific because it details what is missing in the tables related to the ablation experiment.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed and specifies what needs to be addressed in that part.\n\n- **Label**: Based on the definitions, the appropriate label for this comment is \"5: Fully grounded and specific.\"\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: 3. It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: 1) The paper does not dig into the theory profs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions that the paper does not delve into \"the theory proofs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper where this issue is evident.\n- The authors are left without a clear indication of which part of the paper is being addressed. There is no literal mention of sections or unique identifiers that would help the authors pinpoint the exact location of the issue.\n- Therefore, the comment lacks grounding as it does not help the authors identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment highlights a general issue: the lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties. However, it does not provide details on what specific proofs or convergence properties are missing or how they should be addressed.\n- There is no mention of specific examples, references, or detailed suggestions that would guide the authors in addressing the issue.\n- As a result, the comment is unspecific in terms of what exactly needs to be improved or added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the authors cannot confidently determine which part of the paper the comment addresses, nor do they have clear guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the comment is best categorized as \"Not Grounded\" (Category 1).\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: 2. Would the use of feature engineering help in improving the performance? Uto et al. (2020)'s system reaches a QWK of 0.801 by using a set of hand-crafted features. Perhaps using Uto et al. (2020)'s same feature set could also improve the results of this work.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. However, it discusses the potential improvement of the system's performance, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper that the authors can identify.\n2. **Inference by Authors**: The authors can infer that the comment addresses the section of the paper where the system's performance is discussed, even though it is not explicitly mentioned. This suggests weak grounding, as the authors have a hint about the relevant part but cannot pinpoint it with certainty.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that the use of feature engineering, particularly the feature set from Uto et al. (2020), might improve the system's performance. This provides a clear direction for what could be addressed or explored further.\n2. **Mention of External Work**: The comment references Uto et al. (2020) and provides a specific example of a feature set that achieved a QWK of 0.801, adding specificity to the suggestion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Grounding**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify a specific part of the paper, but the authors can infer the relevant section.\n- **Specificity**: The comment is specific in suggesting the use of feature engineering and referencing Uto et al. (2020) as an example.\n\nGiven this analysis, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate because the comment lacks explicit grounding but provides specific guidance on what could be improved.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point:\n- The experimental comparison with other methods seems to be a bit unfair. As the proposed method was pre-trained before the fine-tuning stage, it is unclear if the compared methods were also initialised with the same (or similar scale) pre-trained model. If not, as shown in Table 1, the proposed method without SSL performs inferior to most of the compared methods.\n\n"}]}}

It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model?

It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: - The paper claims the model generalizes to different knowledge but I think the substructure has to be represented as a sequence of words, e.g. it doesn't seem straightforward for me to use constituent parse as knowledge here. Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded.

There is no literal mention of sections or unique identifiers that would help the authors pinpoint the exact location of the issue.\n- Therefore, the comment lacks grounding as it does not help the authors identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment highlights a general issue: the lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties. However, it does not provide details on what specific proofs or convergence properties are missing or how they should be addressed.\n- There is no mention of specific examples, references, or detailed suggestions that would guide the authors in addressing the issue.\n- As a result, the comment is unspecific in terms of what exactly needs to be improved or added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the authors cannot confidently determine which part of the paper the comment addresses, nor do they have clear guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the comment is best categorized as \"Not Grounded\" (Category 1).\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: 1) Is it necessary to treat concept map extraction like the way it is?

Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or through unique aspects of the paper.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment mentions \"the experiments\" as the main weakness.

However, it refers to the \"morph-fitted embeddings\" and their performance in the evaluation, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper. This gives the authors a hint about the part of the paper being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: Since the authors can make an educated guess about which part of the paper is being addressed (the section discussing morph-fitted embeddings and their evaluation), but it is not explicitly mentioned, the comment is weakly grounded.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that there is a need for an analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better and how this aligns with the authors' intuitive motivation. This is a clear indication of what the reviewer feels is missing or needs to be addressed.\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed, namely the analysis of the performance of morph-fitted embeddings and its alignment with the authors' motivation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, but it is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed. Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is 3: Weakly grounded and specific.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: 1. The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper. This allows the authors to accurately identify the section being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper's methodology. This further helps in grounding the comment.\n\nGiven these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that the authors should clarify the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training. It also suggests renaming a column in Table 1 and provides a detailed suggestion for restructuring the table with two big columns: 'Mixture training data' and 'Single source data'.\n2. **Clear Instructions**: The comment provides clear instructions on what changes are needed, making it specific.\n\nBased on these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong and provides concrete suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe review comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed (Table 1) and provides detailed instructions on what needs to be changed and how.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point:\n- The explanations for features in Section 3.2 are somewhat intertwined and thus confusing.

The authors cannot confidently determine which part the comment addresses.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Specificity Evaluation**: \n   - The comment suggests the addition of \"some additional baselines,\" which is a general suggestion. It does not specify what kind of baselines, how many, or in what context they should be added.\n   - There is no mention of specific examples or detailed explanation of what is wrong or missing in the current baselines.\n   - Therefore, the comment lacks specificity as it does not provide detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: \n   - The comment is highly unspecific because it does not specify what needs to be addressed in the paper.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the comment is categorized as \"Not Grounded.\" It does not identify a specific area in the paper, and it is highly unspecific.\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: 3. It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: 2. Would the use of feature engineering help in improving the performance? Uto et al. (2020)'s system reaches a QWK of 0.801 by using a set of hand-crafted features. Perhaps using Uto et al. (2020)'s same feature set could also improve the results of this work.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. However, it discusses the potential improvement of the system's performance, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper that the authors can identify.\n2. **Inference by Authors**: The authors can infer that the comment addresses the section of the paper where the system's performance is discussed, even though it is not explicitly mentioned. This suggests weak grounding, as the authors have a hint about the relevant part but cannot pinpoint it with certainty.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that the use of feature engineering, particularly the feature set from Uto et al. (2020), might improve the system's performance. This provides a clear direction for what could be addressed or explored further.\n2. **Mention of External Work**: The comment references Uto et al. (2020) and provides a specific example of a feature set that achieved a QWK of 0.801, adding specificity to the suggestion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Grounding**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify a specific part of the paper, but the authors can infer the relevant section.\n- **Specificity**: The comment is specific in suggesting the use of feature engineering and referencing Uto et al. (2020) as an example.\n\nGiven this analysis, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate because the comment lacks explicit grounding but provides specific guidance on what could be improved.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: 1) Is it necessary to treat concept map extraction like the way it is? On the one hand, many generic summarization systems build a similar knowledge graph and then generate summaries accordingly. On the other hand, with the increase of the node number, the concept map becomes growing hard to distinguish. Thus, the general summaries should be more readable.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions \"concept map extraction,\" which is a specific aspect of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it directly identifies the \"concept map extraction\" part of the paper.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment provides clear guidance or examples of what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment raises questions about the necessity of the current approach to concept map extraction and mentions potential issues with readability as the node number increases. However, it does not provide specific suggestions or detailed guidance on how to address these issues.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is under-specific because it highlights potential issues but lacks detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed. However, it is under-specific because it does not provide detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Final Categorization**: Based on the analysis, the comment is best categorized as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 1. The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper. This allows the authors to accurately identify the section being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper's methodology. This further helps in grounding the comment.\n\nGiven these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that the authors should clarify the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training. It also suggests renaming a column in Table 1 and provides a detailed suggestion for restructuring the table with two big columns: 'Mixture training data' and 'Single source data'.\n2. **Clear Instructions**: The comment provides clear instructions on what changes are needed, making it specific.\n\nBased on these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong and provides concrete suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe review comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed (Table 1) and provides detailed instructions on what needs to be changed and how.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point:\n- What is not clear also to me is how is used the Challenge Set. If I understood correctly, the CS is created by the linguistic experts and it's used for evaluation purposes. Is this used also to augment the training material? If yes, what is the data split you used?\n\n"}]}}

However, it does not provide any explicit identifiers such as section names, numbers, or unique content that would allow the authors to accurately identify the part being addressed.\n- Without any specific references or unique identifiers, the authors cannot determine with confidence which section or content the comment is addressing. This lack of clarity indicates that the comment is not grounded.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment provides a general critique about the space dedicated to assumptions and experimental results but does not specify what is wrong or missing. It lacks details on why the space is considered excessive or how it could be improved.\n- There are no specific examples, suggestions, or detailed explanations provided, indicating a lack of specificity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the analysis, the comment is not grounded because the authors cannot identify with confidence which part of the paper is being addressed.

Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions the \"ablation experiment\" and discusses the performance without reinforcement learning and dependency tree. This is a specific part of the paper, likely detailed in a section dedicated to experiments or results.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed (the ablation experiment).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment specifies that the tables do not list the cases where the dependency tree and reinforcement learning (RL) are not used.

This suggests that the authors can likely identify the sections of the paper being addressed.\n   - The phrase \"the whole picture\" implies a broader issue with how these sections are integrated or presented, which might be inferred by the authors as a general comment on the coherence or synthesis of the results and analyses.\n\n2. **Determine Grounding Category:**\n   - Since the comment refers to specific parts of the paper (results and analyses) and the authors can likely infer the addressed sections, this indicates full grounding.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Identify Specificity Level:**\n   - The comment does not specify what exactly makes it difficult to get the whole picture. It lacks details on whether the issue is with clarity, organization, missing information, or something else.\n   - There are no specific examples or suggestions provided to address the issue.\n\n2. **Determine Specificity Category:**\n   - The comment is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong or missing in the results and analyses sections.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Final Evaluation:**\n  - The comment is fully grounded because it clearly addresses specific parts of the paper (results and analyses).\n  - The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed information on what needs to be improved.\n\n- **Label:**\n  - Based on the evaluation, the comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: - it is always easier to show something (i.e. attention in seq2seq MTL) is not working, but the value would lie in finding out why it fails and changing the attention mechanism so that it works.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n1. **Identification of the Part Addressed:** The comment mentions \"attention in seq2seq MTL,\" which gives a hint about the area being addressed. This suggests that the authors have some idea about which part of the paper is being discussed, but it is not explicitly clear.\n2. **Grounding Level:** Since the authors can guess the general area (attention mechanism in seq2seq MTL) but cannot pinpoint the exact section or detail, this indicates weak grounding. The comment does not make literal mentions of sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that the authors can identify with certainty.\n\n**Specificity:**\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing:** The comment suggests that the value lies in understanding why the attention mechanism fails and how it can be modified. However, it does not provide specific details on what is wrong with the current mechanism or how it can be improved.\n2. **Specificity Level:** The comment lacks specificity because it does not offer concrete suggestions, examples, or detailed guidance on addressing the issue. It remains a general suggestion without actionable insights.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because the authors can only guess the general area being addressed without precise identification.\n- The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed guidance or specific examples for improvement.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"2: Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point: - The paper claims the model generalizes to different knowledge but I think the substructure has to be represented as a sequence of words, e.g. it doesn't seem straightforward for me to use constituent parse as knowledge here. Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point:\n5. **(Performance of TTA methods)** This is an interesting observation, that using non-standard benchmarks breaks a lot of popular TTA methods.

Also what about the ablation studies of MCT without the adaptive metrics.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Parts**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 6\" and \"Table 1,\" which are specific parts of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which sections are being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the alignment between these two tables, which is a unique aspect that the authors can identify.\n\nBased on these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies specific parts of the paper.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that there is an issue with the alignment between the results in \"Table 6\" and \"Table 1.\" It also asks about the ablation studies of MCT without the adaptive metrics.\n2. **Clear Specification**: The comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed: the alignment issue between the tables and the need for ablation studies.\n\nGiven these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong or missing in the paper.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact parts of the paper being addressed and specifies what needs to be addressed in those parts.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: 1) The paper does not dig into the theory profs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions that the paper does not delve into \"the theory proofs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper where this issue is evident.\n- The authors are left without a clear indication of which part of the paper is being addressed. There is no literal mention of sections or unique identifiers that would help the authors pinpoint the exact location of the issue.\n- Therefore, the comment lacks grounding as it does not help the authors identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment highlights a general issue: the lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties. However, it does not provide details on what specific proofs or convergence properties are missing or how they should be addressed.\n- There is no mention of specific examples, references, or detailed suggestions that would guide the authors in addressing the issue.\n- As a result, the comment is unspecific in terms of what exactly needs to be improved or added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the authors cannot confidently determine which part of the paper the comment addresses, nor do they have clear guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the comment is best categorized as \"Not Grounded\" (Category 1).\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: - I was hoping to see some analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better in the evaluation, and how well that corresponds with the intuitive motivation of the authors.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Area**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. However, it refers to the \"morph-fitted embeddings\" and their performance in the evaluation, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper. This gives the authors a hint about the part of the paper being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n2. **Conclusion on Grounding**: Since the authors can make an educated guess about which part of the paper is being addressed (the section discussing morph-fitted embeddings and their evaluation), but it is not explicitly mentioned, the comment is weakly grounded.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that there is a need for an analysis of why the morph-fitted embeddings worked better and how this aligns with the authors' intuitive motivation. This is a clear indication of what the reviewer feels is missing or needs to be addressed.\n2. **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed, namely the analysis of the performance of morph-fitted embeddings and its alignment with the authors' motivation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly mention a specific part of the paper, but it is specific in detailing what needs to be addressed. Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is 3: Weakly grounded and specific.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: 1) Is it necessary to treat concept map extraction like the way it is? On the one hand, many generic summarization systems build a similar knowledge graph and then generate summaries accordingly. On the other hand, with the increase of the node number, the concept map becomes growing hard to distinguish. Thus, the general summaries should be more readable.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or by discussing something unique to the paper.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment explicitly mentions \"concept map extraction,\" which is a specific aspect of the paper. This makes it clear to the authors which part of the paper is being addressed.\n\n- **Conclusion on Grounding**: The comment is fully grounded because it directly identifies the \"concept map extraction\" part of the paper.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment provides clear guidance or examples of what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Comment Analysis**: The comment raises questions about the necessity of the current approach to concept map extraction and mentions potential issues with readability as the node number increases. However, it does not provide specific suggestions or detailed guidance on how to address these issues.\n\n- **Conclusion on Specificity**: The comment is under-specific because it highlights potential issues but lacks detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Overall Evaluation**: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed. However, it is under-specific because it does not provide detailed suggestions or specific guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Final Categorization**: Based on the analysis, the comment is best categorized as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 3. It is unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. Perhaps the MST baseline is an example of such a model? If so, this is not sufficiently described (emphasis is instead put on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation). The paper would be stronger with the inclusion of more baselines based on related work.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions the need for clarity in comparing the proposed models to those that consider only different senses without sememes. It references the MST baseline as a potential example of such a model.\n- The mention of the MST baseline provides some hint or guess about the part of the paper being addressed, but it does not explicitly identify a specific section, table, or figure. Therefore, the authors might have some idea of where this comparison is discussed but cannot confidently pinpoint the exact part.\n- Based on the definitions, this indicates weak grounding, as the authors have some hint but cannot precisely identify the part being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment points out that the comparison is unclear and suggests that more baselines based on related work should be included. However, it does not specify what aspects of the comparison are unclear or what specific additional information is needed.\n- The lack of detailed guidance on what needs to be addressed makes the comment unspecific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the weak grounding (authors have a hint but cannot precisely identify the part) and the lack of specificity (does not specify what needs to be addressed), the comment fits the category of \"Weakly grounded and not specific.\"\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point:\n- The relatively poor performance on nouns makes me uneasy. While I can expect TWSI to do really well due to its nature, the fact that the oracle GAP for PPDBClus is higher than most clustering approaches is disconcerting, and I would like to understand the gap better. This also directly contradicts the claim that the clustering approach is generalizable to all parts of speech (124-126), since the performance clearly isn't uniform.\n\n"}]}}

Would the use of feature engineering help in improving the performance? Uto et al. (2020)'s system reaches a QWK of 0.801 by using a set of hand-crafted features. Perhaps using Uto et al. (2020)'s same feature set could also improve the results of this work.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment does not explicitly mention a specific section, table, or figure in the paper. However, it discusses the potential improvement of the system's performance, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper that the authors can identify.\n2. **Inference by Authors**: The authors can infer that the comment addresses the section of the paper where the system's performance is discussed, even though it is not explicitly mentioned. This suggests weak grounding, as the authors have a hint about the relevant part but cannot pinpoint it with certainty.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that the use of feature engineering, particularly the feature set from Uto et al. (2020), might improve the system's performance. This provides a clear direction for what could be addressed or explored further.\n2. **Mention of External Work**: The comment references Uto et al. (2020) and provides a specific example of a feature set that achieved a QWK of 0.801, adding specificity to the suggestion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Grounding**: The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify a specific part of the paper, but the authors can infer the relevant section.\n- **Specificity**: The comment is specific in suggesting the use of feature engineering and referencing Uto et al. (2020) as an example.\n\nGiven this analysis, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate because the comment lacks explicit grounding but provides specific guidance on what could be improved.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: 4) Not so useful information: While I appreciate the fleshing out of the assumptions, I find that dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results is a lot of space.\nrationale: *Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions \"dedicating a whole section of the paper plus experimental results,\" which implies a reference to a specific part of the paper. However, it does not provide any explicit identifiers such as section names, numbers, or unique content that would allow the authors to accurately identify the part being addressed.\n- Without any specific references or unique identifiers, the authors cannot determine with confidence which section or content the comment is addressing. This lack of clarity indicates that the comment is not grounded.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment provides a general critique about the space dedicated to assumptions and experimental results but does not specify what is wrong or missing. It lacks details on why the space is considered excessive or how it could be improved.\n- There are no specific examples, suggestions, or detailed explanations provided, indicating a lack of specificity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the analysis, the comment is not grounded because the authors cannot identify with confidence which part of the paper is being addressed. Additionally, the comment is not specific as it does not detail what needs to be addressed or improved.\n- Therefore, the appropriate label for this comment is \"1: Not Grounded.\"\n\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: - The main weaknesses of the paper are the experiments, which is understandable for a short paper but I'd still expect it to be stronger.\nrationale: ### Step 1: Evaluate Grounding\n\n- **Grounding Definition**: Grounding measures how well the authors can identify what is being addressed by the comment. Full grounding means the authors can accurately identify which part is being addressed, either through literal mentions or through unique aspects of the paper.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment mentions \"the experiments\" as the main weakness. This is a specific section of the paper, so the authors can likely identify which part is being addressed. Therefore, the comment is fully grounded because it explicitly refers to the experimental section.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Specificity\n\n- **Specificity Definition**: Specificity measures how much the reviewer detailed what is wrong or missing. A specific comment clearly specifies what needs to be addressed.\n\n- **Analysis**: The comment states that the experiments are a weakness but does not provide details on what specifically is lacking or how they could be improved. It lacks specific examples or suggestions for improvement. Therefore, the comment is under-specific.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the experimental section as the area of concern. However, it is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong with the experiments or how they could be improved.\n\n- **Label**: According to the categories provided, this comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 1. The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to \u2018Fully supervised\u2019 from \u2018Supervised\u2019. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns \u2018Mixture training data\u2019 and \u2018Single source data\u2019 which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.\nrationale: ### Grounding:\n1. **Identification of Specific Part**: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1,\" which is a specific part of the paper. This allows the authors to accurately identify the section being addressed.\n2. **Unique Discussion**: The comment discusses the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training, which is likely a unique aspect of the paper's methodology. This further helps in grounding the comment.\n\nGiven these points, the comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n### Specificity:\n1. **Details on What Needs to be Addressed**: The comment specifies that the authors should clarify the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training. It also suggests renaming a column in Table 1 and provides a detailed suggestion for restructuring the table with two big columns: 'Mixture training data' and 'Single source data'.\n2. **Clear Instructions**: The comment provides clear instructions on what changes are needed, making it specific.\n\nBased on these observations, the comment is specific because it details what is wrong and provides concrete suggestions for improvement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe review comment is both fully grounded and specific. It identifies the exact part of the paper being addressed (Table 1) and provides detailed instructions on what needs to be changed and how.\nscore: 5\n\n\nReview Point: - Using integrated gradients to measure the attribution has been studied in existing papers.

However, the comment does not provide explicit references to sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that would allow for full grounding. Therefore, the grounding is weak.\n\n**Specificity:**\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing:** The comment states that \"something needs to be done about this\" regarding the post-processing steps but does not specify what exactly needs to be addressed or improved.\n2. **Specificity Level:** The comment lacks detail about what is wrong or missing in the post-processing steps. It does not provide specific suggestions or examples of what should be changed or considered. Thus, the comment is not specific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because the authors can guess the general area being addressed but cannot pinpoint it with confidence.\n- The comment is not specific because it fails to detail what needs to be addressed or improved.\n\nGiven this analysis, the label \"2: Weakly grounded and not specific\" is appropriate for this comment.\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point:\n- In the experiments, is it reasonable for the German and Law school dataset to have shorter training time in Gerrymandering than Independent? Since in Experiment 2, ERM and plug-in have similar performance to Kearns et al. and the main advantage is its computation time, it would be good to have the code published.\n\n"}]}}

It lacks details on whether the issue is with clarity, organization, missing information, or something else.\n   - There are no specific examples or suggestions provided to address the issue.\n\n2. **Determine Specificity Category:**\n   - The comment is under-specific because it does not detail what is wrong or missing in the results and analyses sections.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Final Evaluation:**\n  - The comment is fully grounded because it clearly addresses specific parts of the paper (results and analyses).\n  - The comment is under-specific because it does not provide detailed information on what needs to be improved.\n\n- **Label:**\n  - Based on the evaluation, the comment should be labeled as \"4: Fully grounded and under-specific.\"\nscore: 4\n\n\nReview Point: 1) The paper does not dig into the theory profs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment mentions that the paper does not delve into \"the theory proofs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\" However, it does not specify any particular section, table, figure, or unique aspect of the paper where this issue is evident.\n- The authors are left without a clear indication of which part of the paper is being addressed. There is no literal mention of sections or unique identifiers that would help the authors pinpoint the exact location of the issue.\n- Therefore, the comment lacks grounding as it does not help the authors identify the specific part of the paper being addressed.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment highlights a general issue: the lack of theoretical proofs and convergence properties. However, it does not provide details on what specific proofs or convergence properties are missing or how they should be addressed.\n- There is no mention of specific examples, references, or detailed suggestions that would guide the authors in addressing the issue.\n- As a result, the comment is unspecific in terms of what exactly needs to be improved or added.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Given the lack of grounding and specificity, the authors cannot confidently determine which part of the paper the comment addresses, nor do they have clear guidance on what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the comment is best categorized as \"Not Grounded\" (Category 1).\nscore: 1\n\n\nReview Point: - The paper claims the model generalizes to different knowledge but I think the substructure has to be represented as a sequence of words, e.g. it doesn't seem straightforward for me to use constituent parse as knowledge here. Finally, I'm hesitating to call it \"knowledge\". This is misleading as usually it is used to refer to world / external knowledge such as a knowledge base of entities, whereas here it is really just syntax, or arguably semantics if AMR parsing is used.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n- The comment addresses the paper's claim about the model's ability to generalize to different types of knowledge. It questions the use of the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures as sequences of words.\n- The comment does not explicitly mention specific sections, tables, or figures in the paper. However, it discusses a unique aspect of the paper\u2014the model's generalization capabilities and the definition of \"knowledge\"\u2014which the authors can likely identify.\n- Therefore, the comment is weakly grounded. The authors have some hints about which part of the paper is being addressed, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Specificity:**\n- The comment specifies concerns about the ambiguity in the term \"knowledge\" and the representation of substructures, particularly in relation to constituent parsing and AMR parsing.\n- It suggests that the authors need to clarify their definition of \"knowledge\" and address potential limitations in handling syntactic or semantic information.\n- The comment is specific in detailing what is perceived as misleading and what needs to be clarified or addressed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because it does not explicitly identify the part of the paper being addressed, but the authors can infer it.\n- The comment is specific in detailing the issues and what needs to be addressed.\n- Therefore, the label \"3: Weakly grounded and specific\" is appropriate.\nscore: 3\n\n\nReview Point: - Using integrated gradients to measure the attribution has been studied in existing papers. The paper also proposes post-processing steps to filter out the \u201cfalse-positive\u201d neurons, however,  somehting needs to be done about this.\nrationale: **Grounding:**\n1. **Identification of the Part Addressed:** The comment mentions \"using integrated gradients to measure the attribution\" and \"post-processing steps to filter out the 'false-positive' neurons.\" These references give the authors some indication of the areas being discussed, likely sections of the paper where these methods are described.\n2. **Grounding Level:** The authors have a hint about which part of the paper is being addressed due to the mention of specific methods and processes. However, the comment does not provide explicit references to sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that would allow for full grounding. Therefore, the grounding is weak.\n\n**Specificity:**\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing:** The comment states that \"something needs to be done about this\" regarding the post-processing steps but does not specify what exactly needs to be addressed or improved.\n2. **Specificity Level:** The comment lacks detail about what is wrong or missing in the post-processing steps. It does not provide specific suggestions or examples of what should be changed or considered. Thus, the comment is not specific.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The comment is weakly grounded because the authors can guess the general area being addressed but cannot pinpoint it with confidence.\n- The comment is not specific because it fails to detail what needs to be addressed or improved.\n\nGiven this analysis, the label \"2: Weakly grounded and not specific\" is appropriate for this comment.\nscore: 2\n\n\nReview Point:\n- The main weaknesses of the paper are the experiments, which is understandable for a short paper but I'd still expect it to be stronger. First, the setting is only on extremely low-resource regime, which is not the only case we want to use data augmentation in real-world applications. Also, sentence classification is an easier task. I feel like the proposed augmentation method has potential to be used on more NLP tasks, which was unfortunately not shown.\n\n"}]}}
