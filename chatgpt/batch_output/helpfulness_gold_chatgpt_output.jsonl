Firstly, it critiques the comparison with Megatron, suggesting that the performance of Megatron and COCO-LM is not significantly superior to other models like RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and DeBERTa of similar sizes.

Secondly, the comment raises a question about the experimental setup, specifically regarding the switch between uncased and cased BPE vocabulary types.
