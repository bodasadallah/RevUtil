These references provide some indication of the areas being discussed, likely sections of the paper where these experiments are described.\\n2. **Grounding Level**: The authors can infer the general area being addressed due to the mention of specific experimental settings and tasks. However, the comment does not provide explicit references to sections, tables, or figures, nor does it discuss something unique to the paper that would allow for full grounding. Therefore, the grounding is weak.\\n\\n### Specificity:\\n1. **Detailing What is Wrong/Missing**: The comment specifies that the experiments are a weakness due to their focus on low-resource settings and sentence classification, suggesting that the proposed method could be applied to more NLP tasks.\\n2. **Specificity Level**: The comment provides some detail about what is perceived as a limitation and suggests a broader application of the method.
