"1) Additional reference regarding explainable NLP Datasets: ""Detecting and explaining unfairness in consumer contracts through memory networks"" (Ruggeri et al 2021)",ARR_2022_233_review,"Additional details regarding the creation of the dataset would be helpful to solve some doubts regarding its robustness.

1) Additional reference regarding explainable NLP Datasets: ""Detecting and explaining unfairness in consumer contracts through memory networks"" (Ruggeri et al 2021) 2) Some aspects of the creation of the dataset are unclear and the authors must address them. First of all, will the author release the dataset or will it remain private?
Are the guidelines used to train the annotators publicly available?
Having a single person responsible for the check at the end of the first round may introduce biases. A better practice would be to have more than one checker for each problem, at least on a subset of the corpus, to measure the agreement between them and, in case of need, adjust the guidelines.
It is not clear how many problems are examined during the second round and the agreement between the authors is not reported.
It is not clear what is meant by ""accuracy"" during the annotation stages.
3) Additional metrics that may be used to evaluate text generation: METEOR (http://dx.doi.org/10.3115/v1/W14-3348), SIM(ile) (http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/P19-1427).
4) Why have the authors decided to use the colon symbol rather than a more original and less common symbol? Since the colon has usually a different meaning in natural language, do they think it may have an impact?
5) How much are these problems language-dependent? Meaning, if these problems were perfectly translated into another language, would they remain valid? What about the R4 category? Additional comments about these aspects would be beneficial for future works, cross-lingual transfers, and multi-lingual settings.
6) In Table 3, it is not clear whether the line with +epsilon refers to the human performance when the gold explanation is available or to the roberta performance when the golden explanation is available?
In any case, both of these two settings would be interesting to know, so I suggest, if it is possible, to include them in the comparison if it is possible.
7) The explanation that must be generated for the query, the correct answer, and the incorrect answers could be slightly different. Indeed, if I am not making a mistake, the explanation for the incorrect answer must highlight the differences w.r.t. the query, while the explanation for the answer must highlight the similarity. It would be interesting to analyze these three categories separately and see whether if there are differences in the models' performances.",1.0,1
3. It will be nice to see some examples of the system on actual texts (vs. other components & models).,ARR_2022_98_review,"1. Human evaluations were not performed. Given the weaknesses of SARI (Vásquez-Rodríguez et al. 2021) and FKGL (Tanprasert and Kauchak, 2021), the lack of human evaluations severely limits the potential impact of the results, combined with the variability in the results on different datasets.
2. While the authors explain the need to include text generation models into the framework of (Kumar et al., 2020), it is not clear as to why only the delete operation was retained from the framework, which used multiple edit operations (reordering, deletion, lexical simplification, etc.). Further, it is not clear how including those other operations will affect the quality and performance of the system.
3. ( minor) It is unclear how the authors arrived at the different components of the ""scoring function,"" nor is it clear how they arrived at the different threshold values/ranges.
4. Finally, one might wonder that the performance gains on Newsela are due to a domain effect, given that the system was explicitly tuned for deletion operations (that abound in Newsela) and that performance is much lower on the ASSET test corpus. It is unclear how the system would generalize to new datasets with varying levels of complexity, and peripheral content.
1. Is there any reason why 'Gold Reference' was not reported for Newsela? It makes it hard to assess the performance of the existing system. 2. Similarly, is there a reason why the effect of linguistic acceptability was not analyzed (Table 3 and Section 4.6)?
3. It will be nice to see some examples of the system on actual texts (vs. other components & models).
4. What were the final thresholds that were used for the results? It will also be good for reproducibility if the authors can share the full set of hyperparameters as well.",1.0,2

### Main questions/comments Looking at the attached dataset files, I cannot work out whether the data is noisy or if I don't understand the format. The 7th example in the test set has three parts separated by [SEP] which I thought corresponded to the headlines from the three sides (left, center, right). However, the second and third headlines don't make sense as stand-alone texts. Especially the third one which states ""Finally, borrowers will receive relief."" seems like a continuation of the previous statements. In addition to the previous question, I cannot find the titles, any meta-information as stated in lines 187-189, nor VAD scores which I assumed would be included.
Part of the motivation is that scaling the production of neutral (all-sides) summaries is difficult. It would be good to quantify this if possible, as a counterargument to that would be that not all stories are noteworthy enough to require such treatment (and not all stories will appear on all sides).
Allsides.com sometimes includes more than one source from the same side -- e.g. https://www.allsides.com/story/jan-6-panel-reportedly-finds-gaps-trump-white-house-phone-records has two stories from Center publishers (CNBC and Reuters) and none from the right. Since the inputs are always one from each side (Section 3.2), are such stories filtered out of the dataset? Of the two major insights that form the basis of this work (polarity is a proxy for framing bias and titles are good indicators of framing bias) only first one is empirically tested with the human evaluation presented in Section 5.1.3. Even then, we are missing any form of analysis of disagreements or low correlation cases that would help solidify the argument. The only evidence we have for the second insight are the results from the NeuS-Title system (compared to the NeuSFT model that doesn't explicitly look at the titles), but again, the comparison is not systematic enough (e.g. no ablation study) to give us concrete evidence to the validity of the claim.
Related to the previous point, it's not clear what the case study mentioned in Section 4.2 actually involved. The insights gathered aren't particularly difficult to arrive at by reading the related literature and the examples in Table 1, while indicative of the arguments don't seem causally critical. It would be good to have more details about this study and how it drove the decisions in the rest of the paper. In particular, I would like to know if there were any counterexamples to the main points (e.g. are there titles that aren't representative of the type of bias displayed in the main article?).
The example in Table 3 shows that the lexicon-based approach (VAD dataset) suffers from lack of context sensitivity (the word ""close"" in this example is just a marker of proximity). This is a counterpoint to the advantages of such approaches presented in Section 5.1.1 and it would be interesting to quantify it (e.g. by looking at the human-annotated data from Section 5.1.3) beyond the safeguard introduced in the second paragraph (metric calibration).
For the NeuS-Title model, does that order of the input matter? It would be interesting to rerun the same evaluation with different permutations (e.g. center first, or right first). Is there a risk of running into the token limit of the encoder?
From the examples shared in Table 3, it appears that both the NeuSFT and NeuS-Title models stay close to a single target article. What strikes me as odd is that neither chose the center headline (the former is basically copying the Right headline, the latter has done some paraphrasing both mostly based on the Left headline). Is there a particular reason for this? Is the training objective discouraging true multi-headline summarisation since the partisan headlines will always contain more biased information/tokens?
### Minor issues I was slightly confused by the word ""headline"" to refer to the summary of the article. I think of headlines and titles as fundamentally the same thing: short (one sentence) high-level descriptions of the article to come. It would be helpful to refer to longer text as a summary or a ""headline roundup"" as allsides.com calls it. Also there is a discrepancy between the input to the NeuS-Title model (lines 479-486) and the output shown in Table 3 (HEADLINE vs ARTICLE).
Some citations have issues. Allsides.com is cited as (all, 2021) and (Sides, 2018); the year is missing for the citations on lines 110 and 369; Entman (1993) and (2002) are seemingly the same citation (and the 1993 is missing any publication details); various capitatlisation errors (e.g. ""us"" instead of ""US"" on line 716) It's not clear what the highlighting in Table 1 shows (it is implicitly mentioned later in the text). I would recommend colour-coding the different types of bias and providing the details in the caption.",1.0,3
"- The paper is not difficult to follow, but there are several places that are may cause confusion. (listed in point 3).",ICLR_2022_3352,"+ The problem studied in this paper is definitely important in many real-world applications, such as robotics decision-making and autonomous driving. Discovering the underlying causation is important for agents to make reasonable decisions, especially in dynamic environments.
+ The method proposed in this paper is interesting and technically correct. Intuitively, using GRU to extract sequential information helps capture the changes of causal graphs.
- The main idea of causal discovery by sampling intervention set and causal graphs for masking is similar to DCDI [1]. This paper is more like using DCDI in dynamic environments, which may limit the novelty of this paper.

Main Questions
(1) During the inference stage, why use samples instead of directly taking the argmax of Bernoulli distribution? How many samples are required? Will this sampling cause scalability problems?
(2) In the experiment part, the authors only compare with one method (V-CDN). Is it possible to compare DYNOTEARS with the proposed method?
(3) The authors mention that there is no ground truth to evaluate the causal discovery task. I agree with this opinion since the real world does not provide us causal graphs. However, the first experiment is conducted on a synthetic dataset, where I believe it is able to obtain the causation by checking collision conditions. In other words, I am not convinced only by the prediction results. Could the author provide the learned causal graphs and intervention sets and compare them with ground truth even on a simple synthetic dataset?
Clarification questions
(1) It seems the citation of NOTEARS [2] is wrongly used for DYNOTEARS [3]. This citation is important since DYNOTEARS is one of the motivations of this paper.
(2) ICM part in Figure 3 is not clear. How is the Intervention set I is used? If I understand correctly, function f
is a prediction model conditioned on history frames.
(3) The term “Bern” in equation (3) is not defined. I assume it is the Bernoulli distribution. Then what does the symbol B e r n ( α t , β t ) mean?
(4) According to equation (7), each node j
has its own parameters ϕ j t and ψ j t
. Could the authors explain why the parameters are related to time?
(5) In equation (16), the authors mention the term “ secondary optimization”. I can’t find any reference for it. Could the author provide more information?
Minor things:
(1) In the caption of Figure 2, the authors say “For nonstationary causal models, (c)….”. But in figure (c) belongs to stationary methods.

1) Originality is limited because the main idea of variable splitting is not new and the algorithm is also not new.,NIPS_2018_476,"Weakness] 1) Originality is limited because the main idea of variable splitting is not new and the algorithm is also not new. 2) Theoretical proofs of existing algorithm might be regarded as some incremental contributions. 3) Experiments are somewhat weak: 3-1) I was wondering why Authors conducted experiments with lambda=1. According to Corollary 1 and 2 lambda should be sufficiently large, however it is completely ignored for experimental setting. Otherwise the proposed algorithm has no difference from [10]. 3-2) In Figure 3, different evaluations are shown in different dataset. It might be regarded as subjectively selected demonstrations. 3-3) I think clustering accuracy is not very significant because there are many other sophisticated algorithms, and initializations are still very important for nice performance. It show just the proposed algorithm is OK for some applications. [Minor points] -- comma should be deleted at line num. 112: ""... + \lambda(u-v), = 0 ..."". -- ""close-form"" --> ""closed-form"" at line num.195-196. --- after feedback --- I understand that the contribution of this paper is a theoretical justification of the existing algorithms proposed in [10]. In that case, the experimental validation with respect to the sensitivity of ""lambda"" is more important rather than the clustering accuracy. So Fig. 1 in feedback file is nice to add paper if possible. I think dropping symmetry is helpful, however it is not new idea that is already being used. So, it will not change anything in practice to use it. Furthermore, in recent years, almost all application researchers are using some application specific extensions of NMF such as sparse NMF, deep NMF, semi-NMF, and graph-regularized NMF, rather than the standard NMF. Thus, this paper is theoretically interesting as some basic research, but weak from an application perspective. Finally, I changed my evaluation upper one as: ""Marginally below the acceptance threshold. I tend to vote for rejecting this submission, but accepting it would not be that bad.""",1.0,5

"1. The paper contains severe writing issues such as grammatical errors, abuses of mathematical symbols, unclear sentences, etc.",ICLR_2022_1675,"Weakness] 1. The paper contains severe writing issues such as grammatical errors, abuses of mathematical symbols, unclear sentences, etc. 2. The paper needs more literature survey, especially about the existing defense methods using the manifold assumption. 3. The paper does not have enough (either theoretical or experimental) progress to get accepted, compared to previous methods using the manifold assumption.
[Comments] 1. First of all, use some spell/grammar checker (or ask someone else to proofread) to fix basic grammatical errors. 2. Section 3 is very unclear in general. First, I cannot understand the reason why the Section is needed at all. Manifold-based defense against adversarial example is not a new approach and reviewers know well about the manifold assumption in the adversarial machine learning setting. Section 3 does not introduce anything new more than those reviewers’ understanding, and the reasonings are too crude to be called an “analysis”. Second, the writing is not cohesive enough. Each paragraph is saying some topic, however, the connections between the paragraphs are not very clear, making Section 3 more confusing. Even in a single paragraph, the logical reasonings between sentences are sometimes not provided at all. Third, some of those contents are added for no reason. For example, Figure 1 exists for no reason whereas the figure is not referred at all in the paper. The propositions mentioned in Section 3.3 are vaguely written and not used at all. By having these unnecessary parts, the writing looks to be verbose and overstating. 3. In Section 5, the defense method should be written with more formality. Based on the description given in the paper “dx = p(max)-p(secondmax)”, it is very unclear what each term means. Each probability (the authors did not even say that they are probabilities) must correspond to the output from a softmax layer, but which model provides such a softmax layer output, the target classifier, or is there another classifier prepared for it? How are the described transformations used to get the divergence value? What does the detector do with the divergence? (All of these details should be described in Section 5.) Section 6.2 mentions some thresholding strategies, how did the detector work in Section 6.1, though? When thresholding is used, what is the threshold value used and what is the rationale of the choice of the threshold value? There are so many missing details to understand the method. 4. Section 7 looks to be a conclusion for experiments. This should be moved to Section 6 and Section 7 should be an overall conclusion of the paper. 5. The suggested method is neither creative nor novel, compared to the existing methods utilizing the distance from manifolds. As pointed out, the defense based on the manifold assumption is not a new approach. [1][3][4][6](These papers are only a few representative examples. There are many other papers on this type of defense.) Moreover, the idea of using probability divergence is already proposed by previous work [1] and an effective attack for such detection already exists. [2] (Of course, this paper proposes another probability divergence, but there is no support that this method could be significantly better than the previous work.) 6. The experiment should be done more extensively. It looks like that some transformations were brought from the Raff et al. paper [5] which tested the defense against the adversary as strong as possible. Specifically, Raff et al. considered potential improvements of existing attacks to attack their work then tested the defense performance against the improved attack. However, the paper only uses vanilla implementation in the Cleverhans library (or by the original authors). The authors should have shown that the proposed method is robust against a stronger adversary because adversaries who are aware of the method will not use a simple version of the attack. (At least, those adversaries will try using the attack suggested by Raff et al.) [References]

- The writing should be improved. Some points in the paper is unclear to me.,NIPS_2018_857,"Weakness: - Long range contexts may be helpful for object detection as shown in [a, b]. For example, the sofa in Figure 1 may help detect the monitor. But in the SNIPER, images are cropped into chips, which makes the detector cannot benefit from long range contexts. Is there any idea to address this? - The writing should be improved. Some points in the paper is unclear to me. 1. In line 121, authors said partially overlapped ground-truth instances are cropped. But is there any threshold for the partial overlap? In the lower left figure of the Figure 1 right side, there is a sofa whose bounding-box is partially overlapped with the chip, but not shown in a red rectangle. 2. In line 165, authors claimed that a large object which may generate a valid small proposal after being cropped. This is a follow-up question of the previous one. In the upper left figure of the Figure 1 right side, I would imagine the corner of the sofa would make some very small proposals to be valid and labelled as sofa. Does that distract the training process since there may be too little information to classify the little proposal to sofa? 3. Are the negative chips fixed after being generated from the lightweight RPN? Or they will be updated while the RPN is trained in the later stage? Would this (alternating between generating negative chips and train the network) help the performance? 4. What are the r^i_{min}'s, r^i_{max}'s and n in line 112? 5.

2. The writing is difficult to follow in many places and can be simplified.,ARR_2022_187_review,"1. Not clear if the contribution of the paper are sufficient for a long *ACL paper.

The writing is difficult to follow in many places and can be simplified.
1. Line 360-367 are occupying too much space than needed. 2. It was not clear to me that Vikidia is the new dataset that was introduced by the paper until I read the last section :) 3. Too many metrics used for evaluation. While I commend the paper’s thoroughness by using different metrics for evaluation, I believe in this case the multiple metrics create more confusion than clarity in understanding the results. I recommend using the strictest metric (such as RA) because it will clearly highlight the differences in performance. Also consider marking the best results in each column/row using boldface text. 4. I suspect that other evaluation metrics NDCG, SRRR, KTCC are unable to resolve the differences between NPRM and the baselines in some cases. For e.g., Based on the extremely large values (>0.99) for all approaches in Table 4, I doubt the difference between NPRM’s 0.995 and Glove+SVMRank 0.992 for Avg. SRR on NewsEla-EN is statistically significant. 5. I did not understand the utility of presenting results in Table 2 and Table 3. Why not simplify the presentation by selecting the best regression based and classification based approaches for each evaluation dataset and compare them against NPRM in Table 4 itself? 6. From my understanding, RA is the strictest evaluation metric, and NPRM performs worse on RA when compared to the baselines (Table 4) where simpler approaches fare better. 7. I appreciate the paper foreseeing the limitations of the proposed NPRM approach. However, I find the discussion of the first limitation somewhat incomplete and ending abruptly. The last sentence has the tone of “despite the weaknesses, NPRM is useful'' but it does not flesh out why it’s useful. 8. I found ln616-632 excessively detailed for a conclusion paragraph. Maybe simply state that better metrics are needed for ARA evaluation? Such detailed discussion is better suited for Sec 4.4 9. Why was a classification based model not used for the zero shot experiments in Table 5 and Table 6? These results in my opinion are the strongest aspect of the paper, and should be as thorough as the rest of the results. 10.

This paper is a differential review given that I previously reviewed the work in the Dec 2021 version submitted to ARR.
There are minor changes to the introduction section, lengthening the introduction and moving the related work section to the more traditional position, right after the introduction.
There are no rebuttals nor notes from the authors to interpret what has been changed from the previous submission, which could have been furnished to ease reviewer burden in checking (I had to read both the new and old manuscripts side by side and align them myself) Many figures could be wider given the margins for the column. I understand you want to preserve space to make up for the new additions into your manuscript, but the wider margins would help for legibility.
Minor changes were made S3.3 to incorporate more connection to prior work. S4.1 Model design was elaborated into subsections, S5.2.1 adds an introduction to LED.

For the CLEVR dataset, the model is basically based on using an object detector to recognize the objects and their properties and build a semantic graph that represents the image. While other approaches that are compared to for this task use object detectors as well, there are many approaches for CLEVR (such as the Neural Module Network, Relation Network, MAC and FiLM) that do not use such strong supervision and therefore the comparison between these approaches in the experimental section is not completely valid. For better comparability, I would be interested to see generalization results when these models are also being fed with at least object-based bounding-boxes representations instead of the earlier commonly used spatial features, as is very common in VQA in the last years (see bottom-up attention networks). * This can be open for debate but I personally believe that the need for reinforcement learning for a static VQA task may be a potential weakness making the approach less data efficient and harder to train the models that use gradient descent.",3.0,21
"• Approach. Computing optimal transport distance is generally an expensive procedure. While authors indicated that it takes seconds to compute it on 36 cores machine, it’s not clear how scalable this method is.

Moreover, how do you compute exactly optimal transport, because the Sinkhorn method gives you a doubly stochastic matrix (how do you go from it to optimal transport?).",ICLR_2021_1944,"I have several concerns regarding this paper.
• Novelty. The authors propose to use Ricci flow to compute the distance between nodes so that to sample edges with respect to that distance. Using Ricci flow for distance computation is a well-studied area (as indicated in related work). The only novel part is that each layer gets a new graph; however, this choice is not motivated (why not to train all layers of GNN on different graphs instead?) and has problems (see next).
• Approach. Computing optimal transport distance is generally an expensive procedure. While authors indicated that it takes seconds to compute it on 36 cores machine, it’s not clear how scalable this method is. I would like to see whether it scales on normal machines with a couple of cores. Moreover, how do you compute exactly optimal transport, because the Sinkhorn method gives you a doubly stochastic matrix (how do you go from it to optimal transport?).
• Algorithm. This is the most obscure part of the paper. First, it’s not indicated how many layers do you use in experiments. This is a major part of your algorithm because you claim that if an edge appears in several layers it means that it’s not adversarial (or that it does not harm your algorithm). In most of the baselines, there are at most 2-3 layers. There are theoretical limitations why GNN with many layers may not work in practice (see, the literature on “GNN oversmoothing”). Considering that you didn’t provide the code (can you provide an anonymized version of the code?) and that your baselines (GCN, GAT, etc.) have similar (or the same) performance as in the original papers (where the number of layers is 2-3), I deduce that your model Ricci-GNN also has this number of layers. With that said, I doubt that it’s possible to make any conclusive results about whether an edge is adversarial or not with 2-3 graphs. Moreover, I would expect to see an experiment on how your approach varies depending on the number of layers. This is a crucial part of your algorithm and not seeing discussion of it in the paper, raises concerns about the validity of experiments.
• Design choices. Another potential problem of your algorithm is that the sampled graphs can become dense. There are hyperparameters \sigma and \beta that control the probabilities and also you limit the sampling only for 2-hop neighborhoods (“To keep graph sparsity, we only sample edges between pairs that are within k hops of each other in G (we always take k = 2 in the experiments).” This is arbitrary and the effect of it on the performance is not clear. How did you select parameters \sigma and \beta? Why k=2? How do you ensure that the sampled graphs are similar to the original one? Does it matter that sampled graphs should have similar statistics to the original graph? I guess, this crucially affects the performance of your algorithm, so I would like to see more experiments on this.
• Datasets. Since this paper is mostly experimental, I would like to see a comparison of this model on more datasets (5-7 in total). Verifying on realistic but small datasets such as Cora and Citeseer limits our intuition about performance. For example, Cora is a single graph of 2.7K nodes. As indicated in [1], “Although small datasets are useful as sanity checks for new ideas, they can become a liability in the long run as new GNN models will be designed to overfit the small test sets instead of searching for more generalizable architectures.” There are many sources of real graphs, you can consider OGB [2] or [3].
• Weak baselines. Another major concern of the validity of the experiments is the choice of the baselines. Neither of GNN baselines (GCN, GAT, etc.) was designed for the defense of adversarial attacks, so choosing them for comparison is not fair. A comparison with previous works (indicated in “Adversarial attack on graphs.” in related work section) is necessary. Moreover, an experiment where you randomly sample edges (instead of using Ricci distance) is desirable to compare the performance against random sampling.
• Ablation. Since you use GCN, why the performance of Ricci-GCN is so different from GCN when there 0 perturbations? For Citeseer the absolute difference is 2% which is quite high for the same models. Also, an experiment with different choices of GNN is desirable.
• Training. Since experiments play important role in this paper, it’s important to give a fair setup for the models in comparison. You write “For each training procedure, we run 100 epochs and use the model trained at 100-th epoch.”. This can disadvantageous for many models. A better way would be to run each model setup until convergence on the training set, selecting the epoch using the validation set. Otherwise, your baselines could suffer from either underfitting or overfitting.

After reading the authors comments.
I applaud the authors for greatly improving their paper via the revision. Now the number of layers is specified and the explanation of having many sampled graphs during training is added, which was missing in the original text and was preventing a full understanding of the reasons why the proposed approach works. Overall, I am leaning toward increasing the score.
I still have several concerns about the practicality of Ricci-GNN. In simple words, the proposed approach uses some metric S (Ricci flow) that dictates how to sample graphs for training. The motivation for using Ricci flow is “that Ricci flow is a global process that tries to uncover the underlying metric space supported by the graph topology and thus embraces redundancy”. This claim cites previous papers, which in turn do not discuss what exactly is meant by “a global process that tries to uncover the underlying metric space”. Spectral embeddings also can be considered as a global metric, so some analysis on what properties of Ricci flow makes it more robust to attacks would be appreciated. Also including random sampling in comparison would confirm that the effect is coming not from the fact that you use more graphs during the training, but from how you sample those graphs. In addition, as the paper is empirical and relies on the properties of Ricci flow which was discussed in previous works and was not addressed in the context of adversarial attacks, having more datasets (especially larger ones) in the experiments would improve the paper.",3.0,22

Then, I present my additional comments which are related to specific expressions in the main text, proof steps in the appendix etc. I would appreciate it very much if authors could address my questions/concerns under “Additional Comments” as well, since they affect my assessment and understanding of the paper; consequently my score for the paper. Summary:
• The paper focuses on convergence of two newly-proposed versions of AdaGrad, namely AdaGrad-window and AdaGrad-truncation, for finite sum setting where each component is smooth and possibly nonconvex.
• The authors prove convergence rate with respect to number of epochs T, where in each epoch one full pass over the data is performed with respect to well-known “random shuffling” sampling strategy.
• Specifically, AdaGrad-window is shown to achieve O ~ ( T − 1 / 2 )
rate of convergence, whereas AdaGrad-truncation attains ( T − 1 / 2 )
convergence, under component-wise smoothness and bounded gradients assumptions. Additionally, authors introduce a new condition/assumption called consistency ratio which is an essential element of their analysis.
• The paper explains the proposed modification to AdaGrad and provide their intuition for such adjustments. Then, the main results are presented followed by a proof sketch, which demonstrates the main steps of the theoretical approach.
• In order to evaluate the practical performance of the modified adaptive methods in a comparative fashion, two set of experiments were provided: training logistic regression model on MNIST dataset and Resnet-18 model on CIFAR-10 dataset. In these experiments; SGD, SGD with random shuffling, AdaGrad and AdaGrad-window were compared. Additionally, authors plot the behavior of their proposed condition “consistency ratio” over epochs. Strengths:
• I think epoch-wise analysis, especially for finite sum settings, could help provide insights into behaviors of optimization algorithms. For instance, it may enable to further investigate effect of batch size or different sampling strategies with respect to progress of the algorithms after every full pass of data. This may also help with comparative analysis of deterministic and stochastic methods.
• I have checked the proof of Theorem 1 in details and had a less detailed look at Theorems 2 and 3. I appreciate some of the technically rigorous sections of the analysis as the authors bring together analytical tools from different resources and re-prove certain results with respect to their adjustments.
• Performance comparison in the paper is rather simple but the authors try to provide a perspective of their consistency condition through numerical evidence. It gives some rough idea about how to interpret this condition.
• Main text is written in a clear; authors highlight their modification to AdaGrad and also highlight what their new “consistency condition” is. Proposed contributions of the paper are stated clearly although I do not totally agree with certain claims. One of the main theorems has a proof sketch which gives an overall idea about authors’ approach to proving the results. Weaknesses:
• Although numerically the paper provides an insight into the consistency condition, it is not verifiable ahead of time. One needs to run a simulation to get some idea about this condition, although it still wouldn’t verify the correctness. Since authors did not provide any theoretical motivation for their condition, I am not fully convinced out this assumption. For instance, authors could argue about a specific problem setting in which this condition holds.
• Theorem 3 (Adagrad-truncation) sets the stepsize depends on knowledge of r
. I couldn’t figure out how it is possible to compute the value r
ahead of time. Therefore, I do not think this selection is practically applicable. Although I appreciate the theoretical rigor that goes into proving Theorem 3, I believe the concerns about computing r
weakens the importance of this result. If I am missing out some important point, I would like to kindly ask the authors to clarify it for me.
• The related work which is listed in Table 1, within the group “Adaptive Gradient Methods” prove \emph{iteration-wise} convergence rates for variants of Adam and AdaGrad, which I would call the usual practice. This paper argues about \emph{epoch-wise} convergence. The authors claim improvement over those prior papers although the convergence rate quantifications are not based on the same grounds. All of those methods consider the more general expectation minimization setting. I would suggest the authors to make this distinction clear and highlight iteration complexities of such methods while comparing previous results with theirs. In my opinion, total complexity comparison is more important that rate comparison for the setting that this paper considers.
• As a follow up to the previous comment, the related work could have highlighted related results in finite sum setting. Total complexity comparisons with respect to finite sum setting is also important. There exists results for finite-sum nonconvex optimization with variance reduction, e.g., Stochastic Variance Reduction for Nonconvex Optimization, 2016, Reddi et. al. I believe it is important to comparatively evaluate the results of this paper with that of such prior work.
• Numerically, authors only compare against AdaGrad and SGD. I would say this paper is a rather theory paper, but it claims rate improvements, for which I previously stated my doubts. Therefore, I would expect comparisons against other methods as well, which is of interest to ICLR community in my opinion.
• This is a minor comment that should be easy to address. For ICLR, supplementary material is not mandatory to check, however, this is a rather theoretical paper and the correctness/clarity of proofs is important. I would say authors could have explained some of the steps of their proof in a more open way. There are some crucial expressions which were obtained without enough explanations. Please refer to my additional comments in the following part.
Additional Comments:
• I haven’t seen the definition that x t , m + 1 = x t + 1 , 1
in the main text. It appears in the supplements. Could you please highlight this in the main text as it is important for indexing in the analysis?
• Second bullet point of your contributions claim that “[consistency] condition is easy to verify”. I do not agree with this as I cannot see how someone could guarantee/compute the value r
ahead of time or even after observing any sequence of gradients. Could you please clearly define what verification means in this context?
• In Assumption A3, I understand that G t e i = g t , i and G t e = ∑ i = 1 m g t , i
. I believe the existing notation makes it complicated for the reader to understand the implications of this condition.
• In the paragraph right above Section 4.2, authors state that presence of second moments, V t , i
enables adaptive methods to have improved rates of SGD through Lemma 3. Could the authors please explain this in details?
• In Corollary 1, authors state that “the computational complexity is nearly O ( m 5 / 2 n d 2 ϵ − 2 ) ~
”. A similar statement exists in Corollary 2. Could you please explain what “nearly” means in this context?
• In Lemma 8 in the supplements, a a T and b b T
in the main expression of the lemma are rank-1 matrices. This lemma has been used in the proof of Lemma 4. As far as I understood, Lemma 8 is used in such a way that a a T or b b T
correspond to something like g t , j 2 – g t − 1 , j 2
. I am not sure if this construction fits into Lemma 8 because, for instance, the expression g t , j 2 – g t − 1 , j 2
is difference of two rank-1 matrices, which could have rank \leq 2. Hence, there may not exist some vector a
such that a a T = g t , j 2 – g t − 1 , j 2
, hence Lemma 8 may not be applied. If I am mistaken in my judgment I am 100% open for a discussion with the authors.
• In the supplements, in section “A.1.7 PROOF OF MAIN THEOREM 1”, in the expression following the first line, I didn’t understand how you obtained the last upper bound to ∇ f ( x t , i )
. Could you please explain how this is obtained? Score:
I would like to vote for rejecting the paper. I praise the analytically rigorous proofs for the main theorems and the use of a range of tools for proving the key lemmas. Epoch-wise analysis for stochastic methods could provide insight into behavior of algorithms, especially with respect to real-life experimental setting. However, I have some concerns:
I am not convinced about the importance of consistency ratio and that it is a verifiable condition.
Related work in Table 1 has iteration-wise convergence in the general expectation-minimization setting whereas this paper considers finite sum structure with epoch-wise convergence rates. The comparison with related work is not sufficient/convincing in this perspective.
(Minor) I would suggest the authors to have a more comprehensive experimental study with comparisons against multiple adaptive/stochastic optimizers. More experimental insight might be better for demonstrating consistency ratio.
Overall, due to the reasons and concerns stated in my review, I vote for rejecting this paper. I am open for further discussions with the authors regarding my comments and their future clarifications.
======================================= Post-Discussions =======================================
I would like to thank the authors for their clarifications. After exchanging several responses with the authors and regarding other reviews, I decide to keep my score.
Although the authors come up with a more meaningful assumption, i.e., SGC, compared to their initial condition, I am not fully convinced about the contributions with respect to prior work: SGC assumption is a major factor in the improved rates and it is a very restrictive assumption to make in practice.
Although this paper proposes theoretical contributions regarding adaptive gradient methods, the experiments could have been a bit more detailed. I am not sure whether the experimental setup fully displays improvements of the proposed variants of AdaGrad.",3.0,23

W1: While theorems suggest ""existence"" of a linear transformation that will approximate the posterior, the actual construction procedure for the ""recovered topic posterior"" is unclear
W2: Many steps are difficult to understand / replicate from main paper
W3: Unclear what theorems can say about finite training sets
W4: Justification / intuition for Theorems is limited in the main paper
Responses to W1-W3 are most important for the rebuttal.
W1: Actual procedure for constructing the ""recovered topic posterior"" is unclear
In both synthetic and real experiments, the proposed self-supervised learning (SSL) method is used to produce a ""recovered topic posterior"" p( w x). However, the procedure used here is unclear... how do we estimate p( w x) using the learning function f(x)?
The theorems imply that a linear function exists with limited (or zero) approximation error for any chosen scalar summary of the doc-topic weights w. However, how such a linear function is constructed is unclear. The bottom of page four suggests that when t=1 and A is full rank, that ""one can use the pseudoinverse of A to recover the posterior"", however it seems (1) unclear what the procedure is in general and what its assumptions are, and (2) odd that the prior may not needed at all.
Can the authors clarify how to estimate the recovered topic posterior using the proposed SSL method?
W2: Many other steps are difficult to understand / replicate from main paper
Here's a quick list of questions on experimental steps I am confused about / would have trouble reproducing
For the toy experiments in Sec. 5:
Do you estimate the topic-word parameter A? Or assume the true value is given?
What is the format for document x provided as input to the neural networks that define f(x)? The top paragraph of page 7 makes it seem like you provide an ordered list of words. Wouldn't a bag-of-words count vector be a more robust choice?
How do you set t=1 (predict one word given others) but somehow also use ""the last 6 words are chosen as the prediction target""?
How do you estimate the ""recovered topic posterior"" for each individual model (LDA, CTM, etc)? Is this also using HMC (which is used to infer the ground-truth posterior)?
Why use 2000 documents for the ""pure"" topic model but 500 in test set for other models? Wouldn't more complex models benefit from a larger test set?
For the real experiments in Sec. 6:
How many topics were used?
How did you get topic-word parameters for this ""real"" dataset?
How big is the AG news dataset? Main paper should at least describe how many documents in train/test, and how many vocabulary words.
W3: Unclear what theorems / methods can say about finite training sets
All the theorems seem to hold when considering terms that are expectations over a known distribution over observed-data x and missing-data y. However, in practical data analysis we do not know the true data generating distribution, we only have a finite training set.
I am wondering about this method's potential in practice for modest-size datasets. For the synthetic dataset with V=5000 (a modest vocabulary size), the experiments considered 0.72 million to 6 million documents, which seems quite large.
What practically must be true of the observed dataset for the presented methods to work well?
W4: Justification / intuition for Theorems is limited in the main paper
All 3 theorems in the main paper are presented without much intuition or justification about why they should be true, which I think limits their impact on the reader. (I'll try to wade thru the supplement, but did not have time before the review deadline).
Theorem 3 tries to give intuition for the t=1 case, but I think could be stronger: why should f(x) have an optimal form p ( y = v 1 x )
? Why should ""these probabilities"" have the form A E [ w x ]
? I know space is limited, but helping your reader figure things out a bit more explicitly will increase the impact.
Furthermore, the reader would benefit from understanding how tight the bounds in Theorem 4 are. Can we compute the bound quality for toy data and understand it more practically?

"- Some questionable design choices. Perplexity is used as a measure of the model retaining semantic information after fine-tuning, and while that does relate to the original task, there are also aspects of domain drift which are possible and separate from catastrophic forgetting. How are such factors controlled?",KE5QunlXcr,"- The PLMs used (BERT) are by current standards, quite old, and quite small. As work in scaling PLMs up to sizes orders of magnitude greater, performance on syntactic tasks has shown to improve naturally (along with many other useful emergent forms of knowledge). Some comparison to larger models / application of this method to such models, is necessary to ensure that the method has any practical purpose.
- There are also no baselines from existing work. There are other forms of fine-tuning, such as adapters, which seek to add additional knowledge to PLMs with less chance of catastrophic forgetting. The authors even cite one of these papers. This is also a confusing oversight, because the many appropriate inline citations which contrast various decisions in this work to decisions in existing work demonstrate a great familiarity with the literation, so lacking any comparison to any existing methods is an odd oversight.
- Some questionable design choices. Perplexity is used as a measure of the model retaining semantic information after fine-tuning, and while that does relate to the original task, there are also aspects of domain drift which are possible and separate from catastrophic forgetting. How are such factors controlled?
- Related, there is questionable motivation. Often when talking about catastrophic forgetting, both the original training and the new task are both relevant. This is clear in the context of robotics, where learning a new behavior should not result in hindering the robot from performing existing behaviors. Is this true in this case? PPL is almost always not a valuable end goal, and the entire PLM/LLM paradigm is built around this notion of pre-training in whatever way leads to learning useful linguistic representations, before fine-tuning, aligning, or few-shotting the model towards the task the user actually cares about. If users never care about both tasks in approximately equal measure, than what good is retaining the original model weights which were not pertinent to the target task?
- There's arguably too much going on here. The focus of the paper aims to be about catastrophic forgetting, but secondary to that, is also the problem of matching the right syntactic fine-tuning task to the right problem. This is not entirely known a priori, so all possible pairings are explored, but realistically a good guess can be made (as it would likely be if pursued in a more practical setting). For instance, it is no surprise that the phrase syntax task helps with key phrase identification. The disadvantage of the exhaustive approach is that it has both distracted from the main takeaway points while cutting into the space available for supporting the main hypothesis.
- No inclusion of baselines from existing work / SOTA on performance tables
- Key extraction F1 results are better than standard optimizers, but negligibly so.
- No discussion of GC vs EWC. When a priori would you choose which method? If the paper included only one such method, traditional optimizers would be the best choice in most situations.",3.0,29

This visualization could more intuitively demonstrate whether SGC’s fine-grained control offers practical performance benefits at different sparsity levels.
2. **Questionable Memory Advantage**: The memory usage for first-order optimization methods largely comes from the model parameters, gradients, activations, and optimizer states. Even with Adam’s two states, optimizer memory costs are typically less than half. SGC, based on Adam, can’t reduce memory below that of simple SGD without momentum, and since it still calculates full gradients, its GPU memory consumption may surpass LoRA, which doesn’t require full gradient computations.
3. **Subpar Performance**: As seen in Table 2, SGC shows no clear performance advantage over methods like LoRA and GaLore, raising questions about its efficacy as a fine-tuning method.
4. **Lack of Related Work Comparison**: The paper omits discussion and comparison with relevant optimizers like Adafactor[1] and CAME[2], which also focus on compressing optimizer states. These omissions reduce the context for understanding SGC’s place among similar methods. Including a comparison on task performance, memory efficiency and convergence speed would better contextualize SGC's advantages and place among similar methods. **References**:

Meanwhile, the experimental part lacks new insights except for some expected results.
Major comments:
1.	Theorem 3.7 looks like a direct combination of theoretical results obtained by Adam without momentum and SAM. Furthermore, the proof in Appendix does not consider the convergence guarantee that could be achieved by random walk method. That is, the Markov chain is not considered. Note that the last equation in Page 13 is almost the same as the convergence result (Theorem 4.3, Triastcyn et al., 2022)) except it does not have the compression part. The proof also follows exactly as Triastcyn et al. (2022). The perturbed model is not used, means that sharp awareness minimization is not analyzed, which makes me question the soundness of Theorem 3.7.
2.	Since SAM is integrated to prevent potential overfitting, the experiment should present this effect compared with its counterpart that does not have the perturbed model. The lack of this experiment comparison would question the necessity of incorporating SAM in the proposed Localized framework.
3.	The simulation only shows the loss performance of the proposed algorithms and the benchmarks, however, in practical, we would be more interested to see the classification accuracy.
4.	The proposed algorithm is compared with FedAvg, however, for FedAvg, not all agents are communicating all the time, which does not make sense in the setting that FedAvg does not need to consider communication. That means, I suppose that if all agents in FedAvg communicate all the time, the performance of FedAvg might be much better than all the other methods, since there exists a coordinator, although the communication cost would be very high. The figures presented, however, show that Localized SAM is always better than FedAvg in the random sample setting in both performance and communication, which is not a fair comparison.
Minor comments:
1.	In Page 2, first paragraph, Localized SAM is introduced first and then “sharpness-aware minimization (SAM (Foret et al., 2021))” is repeated again. It would be better to revise it.

Thus I find these results novel and exciting.Modeling studies of neural responses are usually measured on two scales: a. Their contribution to our understanding of the neural physiology, architecture or any other biological aspect. b. Model accuracy, where the aim is to provide a model which is better than the state of the art. To the best of my understanding, this study mostly focuses on the latter, i.e. provide a better than state of the art model. If I am misunderstanding, then it would probably be important to stress the biological insights gained from the study. Yet if indeed modeling accuracy is the focus, it's important to provide a fair comparison to the state of the art, and I see a few caveats in that regard: 1. The authors mention the GLM model of Pillow et al. which is pretty much state of the art, but a central point in that paper was that coupling filters between neurons are very important for the accuracy of the model. These coupling filters are omitted here which makes the comparison slightly unfair. I would strongly suggest comparing to a GLM with coupling filters. Furthermore, I suggest presenting data (like correlation coefficients) from previous studies to make sure the comparison is fair and in line with previous literature. 2. The authors note that the LN model needed regularization, but then they apply regularization (in the form of a cropped stimulus) to both LN models and GLMs. To the best of my recollection the GLM presented by pillow et al. did not crop the image but used L1 regularization for the filters and a low rank approximation to the spatial filter. To make the comparison as fair as possible I think it is important to try to reproduce the main features of previous models. Minor notes: 1. Please define the dashed lines in fig. 2A-B and 4B. 2.

"- The explanations for features in Section 3.2 are somewhat intertwined and thus confusing. The section would be more coherently organized with more separate paragraphs dedicated to each of lexical features and sentence-level features, by:",ACL_2017_31_review,"] See below for details of the following weaknesses: - Novelties of the paper are relatively unclear.
- No detailed error analysis is provided.
- A feature comparison with prior work is shallow, missing two relevant papers.
- The paper has several obscure descriptions, including typos.
[General Discussion:] The paper would be more impactful if it states novelties more explicitly. Is the paper presenting the first neural network based approach for event factuality identification? If this is the case, please state that.
The paper would crystallize remaining challenges in event factuality identification and facilitate future research better if it provides detailed error analysis regarding the results of Table 3 and 4. What are dominant sources of errors made by the best system BiLSTM+CNN(Att)? What impacts do errors in basic factor extraction (Table 3) have on the overall performance of factuality identification (Table 4)? The analysis presented in Section 5.4 is more like a feature ablation study to show how useful some additional features are.
The paper would be stronger if it compares with prior work in terms of features. Does the paper use any new features which have not been explored before? In other words, it is unclear whether main advantages of the proposed system come purely from deep learning, or from a combination of neural networks and some new unexplored features. As for feature comparison, the paper is missing two relevant papers: - Kenton Lee, Yoav Artzi, Yejin Choi and Luke Zettlemoyer. 2015 Event Detection and Factuality Assessment with Non-Expert Supervision. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1643-1648.

Modeling Factuality Judgments in Social Media Text. In Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 415-420.
The paper would be more understandable if more examples are given to illustrate the underspecified modality (U) and the underspecified polarity (u). There are two reasons for that. First, the definition of 'underspecified' is relatively unintuitive as compared to other classes such as 'probable' or 'positive'.
Second, the examples would be more helpful to understand the difficulties of Uu detection reported in line 690-697. Among the seven examples (S1-S7), only S7 corresponds to Uu, and its explanation is quite limited to illustrate the difficulties.
A minor comment is that the paper has several obscure descriptions, including typos, as shown below: - The explanations for features in Section 3.2 are somewhat intertwined and thus confusing. The section would be more coherently organized with more separate paragraphs dedicated to each of lexical features and sentence-level features, by: - (1) stating that the SIP feature comprises two features (i.e., lexical-level and sentence-level) and introduce their corresponding variables (l and c) *at the beginning*; - (2) moving the description of embeddings of the lexical feature in line 280-283 to the first paragraph; and - (3) presenting the last paragraph about relevant source identification in a separate subsection because it is not about SIP detection.
- The title of Section 3 ('Baseline') is misleading. A more understandable title would be 'Basic Factor Extraction' or 'Basic Feature Extraction', because the section is about how to extract basic factors (features), not about a baseline end-to-end system for event factuality identification.
- The presented neural network architectures would be more convincing if it describes how beneficial the attention mechanism is to the task.
- Table 2 seems to show factuality statistics only for all sources. The table would be more informative along with Table 4 if it also shows factuality statistics for 'Author' and 'Embed'.
- Table 4 would be more effective if the highest system performance with respect to each combination of the source and the factuality value is shown in boldface.
- Section 4.1 says, ""Aux_Words can describe the *syntactic* structures of sentences,"" whereas section 5.4 says, ""they (auxiliary words) can reflect the *pragmatic* structures of sentences."" These two claims do not consort with each other well, and neither of them seems adequate to summarize how useful the dependency relations 'aux' and 'mark' are for the task.
- S7 seems to be another example to support the effectiveness of auxiliary words, but the explanation for S7 is thin, as compared to the one for S6. What is the auxiliary word for 'ensure' in S7?

"- As mentioned in the previous question, the distribution of videos of different lengths within the benchmark is crucial for the assessment of reasoning ability and robustness, and the paper does not provide relevant explanations. The authors should include a table showing the distribution of video lengths across the dataset, and explain how they ensured a balanced representation of different video lengths across the 11 categories.",BTr3PSlT0T,"- I express skepticism about whether the number of videos in the benchmark can achieve a robust assessment. The CVRR-ES benchmark includes only 214 videos, with the shortest video being just 2 seconds. Upon reviewing several videos from the anonymous link, I noticed a significant proportion of short videos. I question whether such short videos can adequately cover 11 categories. Moreover, current work that focuses solely on designing Video-LLMs, without specifically constructing evaluation benchmarks, provides a much larger number of assessment videos than the 214 included in CVRR-ES, for example, Tarsier [1].
- As mentioned in the previous question, the distribution of videos of different lengths within the benchmark is crucial for the assessment of reasoning ability and robustness, and the paper does not provide relevant explanations. The authors should include a table showing the distribution of video lengths across the dataset, and explain how they ensured a balanced representation of different video lengths across the 11 categories.
- In the motivation, it is mentioned that the goal is to build human-centric AI systems. Does the paper's reflection on this point merely consist of providing a human baseline? I think that offering more fine-grained visual examples would be more helpful for human-AI comparisons.
- I think that the contribution of the DSCP is somewhat overstated and lacks novelty. Such prompt engineering-based methods have already been applied in many works for data generation, model evaluation, and other stages. The introduction and ablation experiments of this technology in the paper seem redundant.
- The discussion on DSCP occupies a significant portion of the experimental analysis. I think that the current analysis provided in the paper lacks insight and does not fully reflect the value of CVRR-ES, especially in terms of human-machine comparison.
- The phrase should be ""there exist a few limitations"" instead of ""there exist few limitations"" in line 520.
- The paper does not provide prompt templates for all the closed-source and open-source Video-LLMs used, which will influence the reproducibility.
The problems discussed in this paper are valuable, but the most crucial aspects of benchmark construction and evaluation are not entirely convincing. Instead, a significant amount of space is dedicated to introducing the DSCP method. I don't think it meets the acceptance standards of ICLR yet. I will consider modifying the score based on the feedback from other reviewers and the authors' responses. ***

"5. **(Performance of TTA methods)** This is an interesting observation, that using non-standard benchmarks breaks a lot of popular TTA methods. If the authors can evaluate TTA on more conditions of natural distribution shift, like WILDS [9], it could really strengthen the paper.",X4ATu1huMJ,"**Overall comment**
The paper discusses evaluating TTA methods across multiple settings, and how to choose the correct method during test-time. I would argue most of the methods/model selection strategies that are discussed in the paper are not novel and/or existed before, and the paper does not have a lot of algorithmic innovation.
While this discussion unifies various prior methods and can be a valuable guideline for practitioners to choose the appropriate TTA method, there needs to be more experiments to make it a compelling paper (i.e., add MEMO [1] as a method of comparison, add WILDS-Camelyon 17 [9], WILDS-FMoW [9], ImageNet-A [7], CIFAR-10.1 [8] as dataset benchmarks). But I do feel the problem setup is very important, and adding more experiments and a bit of rewriting can make the paper much stronger.
**Abstract and Introduction**
1. The paper mentions model restarting to avoid error propagation. There has been important work in TTA, where the model adapts its parameters to only one test example at a time, and reverts back to the initial (pre-trained) weights after it has made the prediction, doing the process all over for the next test example. This is also an important setting to consider, where only one test example is available, and one cannot rely on batches of data from a stream. For example, see MEMO [1].
2. (nitpicking, not important to include in the paper) “under extremely long scenarios all existing TTA method results in degraded performance”, while this is true, the paper does not mention some recent works that helps alleviate this. E.g., MEMO [1] in the one test example at a time scenario, or MEMO + surgical FT [2] where MEMO is used in the online setting, but parameter-efficient updating helps with feature distortion/performance degradation. So the claim is outdated.
3. It would be good to cite relevant papers such as [4] as prior works that look into model selection strategies (but not for TTA setting) to motivate the problem statement.
**Section 3.2, model selection strategies in TTA**
1. While accuracy-on-the-line [3] shows correlation between source (ID) and target (OOD) accuracies, some work [4] also say source accuracy is unreliable in the face of large domain gaps. I think table 3 shows the same result. Better to cite [4] and add their observation.
2. Why not look at agreement-on-the-line [5]? This is known to be a good way of assessing performance on the target domain without having labels. For example, A-Line [6] seems to have good performance on TTA tasks. This should also be considered as a model selection method.
**Section 4.1, datasets**
1. Missing some key datasets such as ImageNet-A [7], CIFAR-10.1 [8]. It is important to consider ImageNet-A (to show TTA’s performance on adversarial examples) and CIFAR-10.1, to show TTA’s performance on CIFAR-10 examples where the shift is natural, i.e., not corruptions. Prior work such as MEMO [1] has used some of these datasets.
**Section 4.3, experimental setup**
1. The architecture suite that is used is limited in size. Only ResNext-29 and ResNet-50 are used. Since the paper’s goal is to say something rigorous about model selection strategies, it is important to try more architectures to have a comprehensive result. At least some vision-transformer architecture is required to make the results strong. I would suggest trying RVT-small [12] or ViT-B/32 [13].
Why do the authors use SGD as an optimizer for all tasks? It is previously shown that [14] SGD often performs worse for more modern architectures. The original TENT [15] paper also claims they use SGD for ImageNet and for everything else they use Adam [16].
**Section 5, results**
1. (Table 1) It might be easier if the texts mention that each row represent one method, and each column represents one model selection strategy. When the authors say “green” represents the best number, they mean “within a row”.
2. (Different methods’ ranking under different selection strategies) The results here are not clear and hard to read. How many times does one method outperform the other, when considering all different surrogate based metrics across all datasets? If the goal is to show consistency of AdaContrast as mentioned in the introduction, a better way of presenting this might be making something similar to table 1 of [17].
3. What does the **Median** column in Table 2 and 3 represent? There is no explanation given for this in paper.
4. I assume the 4 surrogate strategies are: S-Acc, Cross-Acc, Ent and Con. If so, then the statement **“While EATA is significantly the best under the oracle selection strategy (49.99 on average) it is outperformed for example by Tent (5th method using oracle selection) when using 3 out of 4 surrogate-based metrics”** is clearly False according to the last section of Table 2: Tent > EATA on Cross-Acc and Con, but EATA > Tent when using S-Acc and Ent.
5. **(Performance of TTA methods)** This is an interesting observation, that using non-standard benchmarks breaks a lot of popular TTA methods. If the authors can evaluate TTA on more conditions of natural distribution shift, like WILDS [9], it could really strengthen the paper.",5.0,46

Almost all across the board, the paraphrase similarity view does significantly better than other views and their combination. What, then, do we learn about the usefulness of the other views? There is one empirical example of how the different views help in clustering paraphrases of the word 'slip', but there is no further analysis about how the different clustering techniques differ, except on the task directly. Without a more detailed analysis of differences and similarities between these views, it is hard to draw solid conclusions about the different views. - The paper is not fully clear on a first read. Specifically, it is not immediately clear how the sections connect to each other, reading more like disjoint pieces of work. For instance, I did not understand the connections between section 2.1 and section 4.3, so adding forward/backward pointer references to sections should be useful in clearing up things. Relatedly, the multi-view clustering section (3.1) needs editing, since the subsections seem to be out of order, and citations seem to be missing (lines 392 and 393).

- General Discussion: The paper is mostly straightforward in terms of techniques used and experiments. Even then, the authors show clear gains on the lexsub task by their two-pronged approach, with potentially more to be gained by using stronger WSD algorithms.
Some additional questions for the authors : - Lines 221-222 : Why do you add hypernyms/hyponyms?
- Lines 367-368 : Why does X^{P} need to be symmetric?
- Lines 387-389 : The weighting scheme seems kind of arbitrary. Was this indeed arbitrary or is this a principled choice?
- Is the high performance of SubstClus^{P} ascribable to the fact that the number of clusters was tuned based on this view? Would tuning the number of clusters based on other matrices affect the results and the conclusions?
- What other related tasks could this approach possibly generalize to? Or is it only specific to lexsub?",5.0,47
