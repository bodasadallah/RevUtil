However, the comment does not provide specific examples or references to the classical attack methods it suggests should be considered. Without these details, the claim lacks sufficient support, making it difficult for the authors to understand which methods are being referred to and why they should be included. Therefore, the comment is rated as 2: Borderline Verifiable, as it provides some reasoning but lacks the necessary detail to be fully actionable.\n",
      "The comment claims that some details of the models are missing, specifically mentioning the lack of explanation regarding the grammar over kernels. The reviewer questions how this approach is applied in practice and raises additional questions about probabilities and inference. While the comment identifies specific areas that are unclear, it does not provide any supporting evidence or references to substantiate the claim or suggest how these details could be addressed. This makes the comment somewhat verifiable, as it highlights a gap but lacks detailed justification or examples to fully support the claim. Therefore, the comment is categorized as 3: Somewhat Verifiable.\n",
      "The review point suggests that the time complexity of the learning algorithm should be explicitly estimated to demonstrate its scalability properties.

Therefore, the review point does not contain claims requiring verification, making \"No\" the correct label.\n",
      "The review point suggests including a hard prompt baseline in Table 1 to evaluate the performance increase of each method. However, the comment does not provide any specific reasoning, examples, or references to justify why this inclusion is necessary or how it would benefit the analysis. Without additional context or explanation, the authors may find it challenging to understand the importance of this suggestion. Therefore, the comment is considered unverifiable.\n",
      "The comment questions the clarity of the explanation regarding the number of parameters in the S2D structure and provides a logical deduction about the potential increase in parameters. It also agrees with the efficiency improvement but requests more details. The statement contains a mix of observations, logical deductions, and a request for clarification, but it does not assert a subjective claim requiring verification. Therefore, it is classified as \"No.\"\n",
      "The review point makes a claim about a potential labeling error in Fig. 4, suggesting that one of the labels on the color bar should say \"worse.\" However, the comment does not provide any supporting evidence or reasoning to verify this claim. It lacks specific details or references to the figure that would help the authors understand why the label might be incorrect or how it affects the interpretation of the figure. As a result, the claim is unverifiable due to the absence of justification or evidence. Therefore, the comment is classified as 1: Unverifiable.\n",
      "The review point highlights the specificity of the setting required for the approach, mentioning the need to know the model, access to a generative model, episodic problems, and end-of-task rewards. However, it does not provide any supporting evidence, reasoning, or references to justify why these requirements are limiting or how they could be addressed. Without additional context or explanation, the authors may find it challenging to understand and address the issue. Therefore, the comment is considered unverifiable.\n",
      "The review comment is vague and lacks clarity, making it difficult for the authors to understand the specific issue being raised. It seems to question an aspect related to matrix inversion or sample division, but it does not provide enough context or detail to be actionable. Additionally, the mention of \"Mistakes in Eqs.\" is not elaborated upon, leaving the authors without guidance on what needs correction or improvement. Without clear, detailed feedback, the comment does not offer meaningful direction for the authors to enhance their draft, categorizing it as not helpful at all. Therefore, it aligns with a score of 1.\n",
      "The review comment raises a question about the necessity of detecting both entities in the example of Figure 2, questioning the difference between detecting both entities versus just the longer one. While this question could prompt the authors to clarify their reasoning or provide additional justification, the comment lacks depth and does not offer specific suggestions or guidance on how to address the issue. It is more of a prompt for clarification rather than actionable feedback. Therefore, the comment is barely helpful, as it identifies a potential area for clarification but does not provide substantial guidance for improvement.\n",
      "The review comment points out a minor issue with Figure 6, specifically noting that the font size is a little bit small.

It lacks depth and actionable advice, leaving the authors with only a vague indication that more information might be needed. As such, the comment is barely helpful, as it points out a potential area for improvement but does not offer sufficient direction for the authors to act upon. Therefore, it aligns with a score of 2.\n",
      "The review comment poses a question about the comparison between the PL condition used in the paper and those proposed in a specific reference. While it prompts the authors to consider an important aspect of their work, it lacks depth and actionable guidance. The comment does not provide specific suggestions or insights into why this comparison is important or how it might impact the paper's conclusions. Without further elaboration or context, the authors may find it challenging to address the question effectively. Therefore, the feedback is barely helpful as it highlights an area for consideration but does not fully support the authors in making improvements to their draft.\n",
      "The comment critiques the paper for being a combination of existing techniques, suggesting that the contribution may be incremental. While it identifies specific works and methods that the paper builds upon, it does not provide constructive feedback or actionable suggestions for how the authors might enhance the originality or impact of their work. Without guidance on how to address the perceived incremental nature of the contribution, the comment offers limited value to the authors in terms of improving their draft. Therefore, it aligns with a score of 1, as it is not helpful at all.\n",
      "The review comment identifies a specific issue with Table 3, noting that many strong baselines, such as those in a referenced work [1], are not compared. By pointing out this omission, the comment highlights a gap in the experimental comparison that could weaken the paper's claims. However, the comment does not provide specific guidance on how to address this issue, such as suggesting which baselines to include or how to incorporate them into the analysis. Additionally, the comment asks for justification rather than directly suggesting an improvement, which limits its helpfulness. While it raises an important point, the lack of actionable guidance makes the feedback barely helpful.\n",
      "The review comment raises curiosity about the performance of a specific baseline, LDA+LSTM, in terms of the topic switch percent metric. While it shows interest in a particular aspect of the experiment, it does not identify any weaknesses or provide suggestions for improvement. The comment lacks actionable feedback or guidance that would help the authors enhance their draft. It merely expresses a desire for additional information without indicating how this information could be used to improve the paper. Therefore, the comment is rated as barely helpful, consistent with a score of 2.\n",
      "The review comment identifies a gap in the experimental section of the paper, specifically noting the absence of experiments related to contrastive learning and adversarial learning. While it highlights an area for improvement, the comment lacks detail and specificity, such as why these experiments are important or how they could enhance the paper's contributions. Without additional context or guidance, the authors are left with a general idea of what is missing but no clear direction on how to address it. Therefore, the comment is rated as barely helpful, as it points out a deficiency but does not provide actionable advice for improvement.\n",
