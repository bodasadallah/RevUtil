I would appreciate it is the authors could explain their strategy in more detail . ,replicability_negative
"During the learning , it is not clear to me how the process is implemented and the scalability of this approach . ",replicability_negative
More details in the implementation can be very helpful for reproducibility . ,replicability_negative
The details of SVHN-MNIST experiment are missing . ,replicability_negative
"my impression is that the reproducibility of the results could be very hard , because of the lack of details of the specific implementation . ",replicability_negative
It was also unclear which parts of the technical approach mattered ? ,replicability_negative
major issue for me is the experimental setup . ,replicability_negative
My biggest complaint would be that there is relatively less detail about how the final model specifically ,replicability_negative
It would be better if there are more details on how the update is carried out during the gradient communication . ,replicability_negative
The description of the experiments requires more detail . ,replicability_negative
All required tools are described/defined ,replicability_positive
provides almost enough details for replication ,replicability_positive
it seems the algorithm is described in sufficient detail ,replicability_positive
The appendices contain a wealth of details that will make this work reproducible ,replicability_positive
paper and adequate information is presented in supplemental material to provide details of the limitation of the results at a systems level ,replicability_positive
model architecture ,replicability_positive
detail ,replicability_positive
are provided ,replicability_positive
and all the hyper parameter setting and details of experiments have been explained well ,replicability_positive
and the results should be easily reproducible ,replicability_positive
"therefore , the detection rate comparison is not convincing ",meaningful_comparison_negative
2 .Lack of comparison to existing works - there are several detection works that already used uncertainty in detection . ,meaningful_comparison_negative
But this comparison fails to make a connection with Section 4.1 in two ways . ,meaningful_comparison_negative
Another downside is that the authors dismiss navigation literature as `` not RL `` . ,meaningful_comparison_negative
Some important previous works are missing from the related work section . ,meaningful_comparison_negative
There are several important baselines are missing : RL ,meaningful_comparison_negative
It 's hard to evaluate new algorithms when the domain studied is also new ,meaningful_comparison_negative
and empirically compared . Please check the liturature and cite the related work appropriately ,meaningful_comparison_negative
It is also not clear to me how the trade-off of performance in exploring the maximum reachable safe set for computational efficiency for the proposed algorithm compares to that of [ 14 ] since there is no empirical comparison with ,meaningful_comparison_negative
It is not clear to connect what the synthetic examples try to deliver and the coloured version of MNIST here ,meaningful_comparison_negative
3.The work spends a lot of pages describing the general problem of unsupervised feature learning and the history of the base algorithms . The literature review is quite extensive . ,meaningful_comparison_positive
acknowledges past solutions to the same problem ,meaningful_comparison_positive
And an extensive literature of theoretical results . ,meaningful_comparison_positive
The authors also do a good job contextualizing the proposed method within the related literature . ,meaningful_comparison_positive
review of related work is thorough ,meaningful_comparison_positive
"I understood how the authors did their example matching , and the comparison experiments are clear . ",meaningful_comparison_positive
The method is properly evaluated and compared to the relevant and state-of-the-art methods at the time . ,meaningful_comparison_positive
The authors clearly illustrate the difference between the proposed approach and the related studies . ,meaningful_comparison_positive
The related work is satisfactory ,meaningful_comparison_positive
thorough . ,meaningful_comparison_positive
