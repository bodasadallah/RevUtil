      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is talking about the baselines in Tables 3, 4, and 6. They mention that the paper\\'s approach outperforms some baselines like the sentence-level model, a naive document-to-document translation model, and Zheng et al. (2020). But the reviewer argues these are weak baselines. They provide specific numbers from Voita et al. (2019) showing higher scores (81.6, 58.1, etc.) compared to the current work\\'s 64.7, 46.3, etc., indicating a significant gap.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check the verifiability. The claim here is that the baselines used are weak. The reviewer supports this by citing specific metrics from Voita et al.\\'s CADec model, which are higher than the current paper\\'s results. That\\'s a concrete example with numbers, which is good. They also mention specific baselines that the paper used (like Zheng 2020) and point out that comparing against stronger baselines like Voita\\'s would be better. \\n\\nThe justification includes specific references (Voita et al. 2019) and numerical data, which are solid. The reviewer isn\\'t just saying \"use better baselines\" without evidence; they back it up with existing work\\'s performance. The logical reasoning is clear: if the current approach underperforms compared to established models not included as baselines, then the chosen baselines aren\\'t strong enough. \\n\\nAre there any gaps here? The reviewer provides the Voita et al. numbers, so the authors can check those references. The only minor thing is maybe not explaining why CADec is a strong baseline, but the numbers themselves speak to that. Since the reviewer gives specific examples and references, this should be enough for the authors to verify and address. \\n\\nSo, according to the scoring criteria, this should be a 5 because it\\'s fully verifiable with explicit references and data. The reasoning is solid, and the evidence is there. The authors can look up Voita\\'s paper and the numbers provided to see the gap. No major missing elements here.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Review Point:**  \\n2) It only compares with some weak baselines in Tables 3, 4, and 6. Though the approach can surpass the sentence-level model baseline, the naive document-to-document translation model, and Zheng et al. (2020), these baselines seem weak. For example, Voita et al. (2019) achieve 81.6, 58.1, 72.2, and 80.0 for deixis, lexical cohesion, ellipsis (infl.), and ellipsis (VP) respectively with the CADec model, while this work only gets 64.7, 46.3, 65.9, and 53.0. It seems that there is still a large gap with the presented approach in these linguistic evaluations.\\n\\n**rationale:**  \\nThe comment claims that the paper’s baselines are weak, supported by direct comparisons to Voita et al. (2019)’s CADec model, which outperforms the current work in key metrics. The reviewer provides specific numerical results (e.g., 81.6 vs. 64.7 for deixis) and explicitly cites']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the verifiability of the comment \"2. The evaluation on the word analogy task seems a bit unfair given that the semantic relations are explicitly encoded by the sememes, as the authors themselves point out (more details below).\" based on the provided criteria.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the scoring criteria. The key here is how well the reviewer supports their claim. The claim here is that the evaluation on the word analogy task is unfair because the semantic relations are explicitly encoded by sememes, which the authors acknowledge.\\n\\nLooking at the scoring scale:\\n\\n- A score of 5 requires the claim to be thoroughly supported with explicit, sufficient evidence like specific references or clear reasoning.\\n- A 4 is mostly verifiable but might have minor gaps, like needing a bit more detail or a reference.\\n- A 3 is somewhat verifiable but missing key elements, requiring the author to make an effort to follow.\\n- A 2 is borderline, with vague or insufficient justification.\\n- A 1 is unverifiable with no support.\\n\\nNow, the reviewer\\'s point mentions that the authors themselves point this out, implying there\\'s a part in the paper where this is discussed. The reviewer is arguing that using sememes (which encode semantic relations) in the evaluation for word analogy tasks might give an unfair advantage because the task is testing exactly that. The justification here is that the authors acknowledge the explicit encoding, so the reviewer is using the paper\\'s own statements to support their claim. \\n\\nHowever, the reviewer doesn\\'t provide a specific citation or page number where the authors mention this. They just say \"as the authors themselves point out (more details below)\". If \"more details below\" exists in the full review, maybe there\\'s more support, but in the given Review Point here, it\\'s just a reference to something else. Since we\\'re only evaluating this specific point, the lack of a direct reference or example in the point itself might weaken it. \\n\\nBut the reviewer is using the authors\\' own admission, which is a form of internal justification. That\\'s a logical reasoning point. However, without pointing to a specific part (like a section or page), it\\'s a bit vague. The claim is supported by the authors\\' own statements, but the reviewer hasn\\'t explicitly cited where that is. \\n\\nSo, if the reviewer had included a specific reference (like \"as mentioned in section X\") or explained how the sememes are encoded in the model\\'s architecture, that would make it more verifiable. But as it stands, the support is there in the sense that the authors do point it out, but the reviewer\\'s explanation is brief. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scoring criteria: \\n\\n- Example for 4 (Mostly Verifiable) includes things like referencing a paper\\'s intro or pointing out a logical inconsistency with results. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a logical issue based on the authors\\' own statements, which is similar. \\n\\n- The example for 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) might be if the reasoning is there but missing specifics. Here, the reviewer is making a logical point but perhaps not providing enough detail. \\n\\nSince the reviewer is using the authors\\' own acknowledgment, that\\'s a form of common sense in the field (if the task evaluates what\\'s explicitly encoded, it\\'s not a fair test).

The reviewer gives an example of the pristine tweets not being pristine and having issues. But do they provide any evidence or justification beyond that example?\\n\\nLooking at the examples in the scoring criteria, a score of 2 is when the support is vague.

However, they don\\'t provide explicit examples, references, or detailed explanations about why \"and\" or element-wise max would be better or how they relate to union/intersection. The comment is pointing out a potential oversight but lacks concrete support. The authors might need to infer why these alternatives are relevant or how they compare without more details. \\n\\nComparing to the scoring criteria: \\n\\n- A score of 2 (Borderline) would be if the justification is vague. The reviewer here is giving a hint about the possible operators but not explaining why exactly they should be considered or how the current choice is inferior. \\n\\n- A score of 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) might apply if there was a bit more reasoning, but since the connection to union/intersection is mentioned, that\\'s some logical reasoning. However, the lack of specifics about why the chosen operators are worse keeps it from being more verifiable. \\n\\nWait, the examples for score 2 include things like \"I have read a paper...\" which is vague. Here, the reviewer is suggesting alternatives based on an analogy (union/intersection), which is a bit of reasoning. But without more explanation or references, it\\'s still on the borderline. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s a 3 because they reference the existing operators (or and min) and suggest the counterparts (and and max), which is a logical extension. But the justification is still minimal. The reviewer says \"it wasn’t clear to me why the ones you chose were better options\"—this is pointing out a lack of clarity in the paper, but the reviewer\\'s own reasoning isn\\'t fully fleshed out. \\n\\nHmm. The key is whether the reasoning is there. The reviewer is using common sense in the field (since they mention union/intersection concepts) to suggest that these operators are logical alternatives. That\\'s a form of common sense verification. But the justification is still brief and doesn\\'t provide evidence like experiments or references showing that \"and\" or max are better. \\n\\nSo maybe it\\'s a 2 because the reasoning is present but not fully explained.

The question itself is a direct query about methodology, but does the reviewer back it up with reasoning or evidence?\\n\\nThe comment doesn't give specific examples or references.

There's no mention of prior work that shows sample size affects results here. \\n\\nSo, the claim is a question without supporting evidence.

      "['Okay, let me try to evaluate this review point based on the verifiability criteria. The reviewer is pointing out a possible inconsistency in the paper\\'s description of their dataset.

The reviewer then suggests that the data might be a subset of Li et al. (2019a) and recommends clarifying this by mentioning the reference earlier.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check if the claim here is supported. The reviewer is pointing out a discrepancy in the paper\\'s text between two sections. They\\'re using specific line numbers, which shows they\\'ve looked at the paper\\'s content. The claim is that the description is unclear and possibly inconsistent because the data is presented as both raw and having pre-existing syntactic info. The reviewer suggests it\\'s a subset of a previous dataset, which would explain the inconsistency. \\n\\nThe justification here comes from the reviewer\\'s observation of conflicting statements in the paper. They reference specific line numbers, which is good because it allows the authors to check exactly where the issue is. However, the reviewer is making an inference that the data is from Li et al.

They don\\'t explicitly cite that paper\\'s content here but are suggesting that mentioning it earlier would clarify things. \\n\\nIs there any external reference or logical reasoning provided? The reviewer does mention Li et al. (2019a), so that\\'s a reference. They are connecting the dataset mentioned in the paper to a prior work, implying that the current paper\\'s dataset is a subset of that. The reasoning is logical: if the data already has syntactic info, it might not be raw data but a subset of an existing dataset. \\n\\nHowever, the reviewer\\'s assumption that it\\'s Li et al. (2019a)\\'s dataset isn\\'t proven here. They might be correct, but without explicit confirmation from the paper, the reviewer is making an educated guess. The main support comes from pointing out the inconsistency in the paper\\'s own text and suggesting a possible resolution. \\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s advice to mention Li et al. earlier would help clarify the confusion, so the justification is based on improving clarity by aligning the description with existing references.

The reasoning is logical but lacks a bit in explaining why Li et al. is the correct reference. \\n\\nHmm. The reviewer provides line numbers, points out the inconsistency, and suggests a possible solution with a reference. The main support is the internal inconsistency noted in the paper. The reference to Li et al. is part of the suggested fix, not necessarily the proof. Since the reviewer is using the paper\\'s own text to highlight the issue, that\\'s solid support.

The reviewer is questioning the verifiability of the claim made by the authors regarding this metric. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria, the comment is pointing out a missing explanation. The reviewer isn\\'t providing external references or detailed logical reasoning beyond pointing out the absence of information. The justification is that the authors didn\\'t explain it, so the claim (whatever the authors\\' claim about the duration is) is not supported. \\n\\nSince the reviewer is highlighting that there\\'s no supporting explanation in the paper, the comment itself is making a claim that the explanation is missing. The support for this claim is the absence of that information. However, the reviewer isn\\'t providing external evidence or logical reasoning beyond the fact that the explanation isn\\'t there. \\n\\nSo, the comment\\'s own verifiability: The claim is that the explanation is missing. The support is the absence in the paper. But does that count as verification? The reviewer is just stating a fact (there\\'s no explanation), so that\\'s a factual claim. But according to the scoring criteria, to get higher scores, there needs to be logical reasoning, common sense, or references. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer is pointing out an omission, which is a valid concern. The justification is that the paper doesn\\'t explain it, so the authors\\' use of the metric is unclear. That\\'s a valid point, but the reviewer isn\\'t providing further reasoning beyond the absence. \\n\\nLooking at the examples for score 2 (borderline): \"The comment provides some support but it\\'s vague or insufficient.\" Here, the support is the absence of explanation, which is a concrete point but maybe not enough. The reviewer isn\\'t giving an example of why it\\'s important or referencing standards. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s a 3 (somewhat verifiable) because the reviewer is pointing out a lack of information, which is a form of justification, but it\\'s missing further details. \\n\\nWait, let\\'s check the examples again. For example, in the 2-point example: \"The method shouldn’t achieve good results. If I remember...\" which is vague. Another example: \"It is unclear whether the momentum term could be a confounding factor...\" which is a bit more reasoned but still without references. \\n\\nIn the current case, the reviewer is stating that there\\'s no explanation, which is a factual observation. The claim is that the explanation is missing, so the justification is the absence. But the reviewer isn\\'t providing reasoning why that matters, like \"without this explanation, readers can\\'t interpret the results properly,\" which would add more reasoning. \\n\\nAlternatively, the reviewer is implying that without knowing what the duration includes, the metric is not interpretable. That\\'s common sense in reporting metrics. So maybe that\\'s common sense verification. \\n\\nThe scoring criteria for 4 (mostly verifiable) requires sufficient support with minor gaps. If the reviewer\\'s point is that the lack of explanation makes the metric\\'s meaning unclear, that\\'s logical reasoning based on common sense (metrics should be clearly defined). The reviewer\\'s own claim is that the explanation is missing, so the support is the absence, which is a factual basis. \\n\\nHmm, maybe this is a 3 or 4. Let me think again. \\n\\nThe comment is pointing out that the explanation is missing. The justification is that there is no supporting explanation. The reviewer is using common sense that metrics need to be explained. So the verification method here is common sense. \\n\\nLooking at the 4-point example: \"The statistical analysis appears incorrect because the p-values don\\'t align with standard thresholds.\" That uses common sense about statistical standards. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer is pointing out that the explanation is missing, which is a common sense issue in reporting. The claim is that the authors didn\\'t explain the metric, so the justification is based on common sense (metrics need to be explained). \\n\\nTherefore, the support is there through common sense reasoning. So maybe it\\'s a 4? \\n\\nAlternatively, since the reviewer isn\\'t explicitly stating the common sense reasoning (like \"because without explanation, readers can\\'t interpret the results\"), but it\\'s implied. \\n\\nThe borderline between 3 and 4 is whether the justification is sufficient. The comment is somewhat supported by the observation of missing explanation, but maybe it\\'s not fully fleshed out. \\n\\nAlternatively, since the reviewer is directly pointing out an omission in the paper (the explanation isn\\'t there), that\\'s a clear factual basis, so maybe 4. \\n\\nWait, looking at another example: \"The two used datasets are very related...\" (scored 4). The justification is that the datasets are related because they use similar inputs. That\\'s logical. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer\\'s claim is that the explanation is missing. The support is the absence, which is a factual observation. The claim is that the authors didn\\'t explain it, so the justification is there. \\n\\nTherefore, maybe it\\'s a 4. But let\\'s see. The reviewer could have provided more reasoning, like \"Without knowing if the duration includes wait time, the results are not comparable to other studies,\" which would add more.

The reviewer\\'s own analysis is based on the data presented in the table. They are noting that the confidence intervals overlap, which is a statistical point. The interpretation here might be that there\\'s no significant difference between the Baseline and NVSB for MOS-V in both languages because the CIs overlap. \\n\\nHowever, does the reviewer provide any justification beyond pointing out the data? The reviewer is essentially asking the authors to explain these observations, but the reviewer\\'s own claim (that this needs interpretation) is based on the data in Table 3. The question is whether the reviewer\\'s own statement is supported. Since they reference the table and the statistical aspect (overlapping CIs), that\\'s a form of logical reasoning. Overlapping CIs can indicate no significant difference, which is a common statistical understanding. \\n\\nSo, the reviewer is using common sense knowledge (overlapping CIs suggest no significant difference) to question the interpretation of the results. They are pointing out that the results might not be as conclusive as the authors suggest. \\n\\nTherefore, the claim here is supported by logical reasoning (overlapping CIs imply no significant difference) and references the specific data in Table 3. The justification is there, but maybe the reviewer could have explained more about why overlapping CIs matter, but the core reasoning is present. \\n\\nComparing to the scoring examples: \\n\\nLooking at a score of 4 (Mostly Verifiable), the example given is about statistical analysis where p-values don\\'t align with significance thresholds. The reasoning there is solid but maybe minor gaps. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer\\'s point is based on the data in the table and statistical common sense. The only minor gap might be not explicitly stating the statistical rule about CIs, but it\\'s a well-known concept. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had cited a reference about confidence intervals, that would push it to 5, but maybe it\\'s not necessary here since it\\'s common knowledge. \\n\\nSo, I think this would be a 4: Mostly Verifiable. The claim is supported by pointing to the data and using statistical reasoning, but perhaps the explanation is brief. The authors can see the table, so the reviewer\\'s point is clear, but they could have elaborated more on the statistical implications. \\n\\nWait, but the reviewer is not making a claim about the results being wrong, but rather asking the authors to interpret them. The reviewer\\'s own comment is a request for interpretation, but the underlying claim is that the results (as per the table) may not show significant differences. The verifiability of the reviewer\\'s own statement (that this needs interpretation) is based on the data. Since they are using the data and common statistical knowledge, this should be verifiable. \\n\\nTherefore, since they reference the table and use common sense (overlapping CIs mean no significant difference), this is a solid justification. So maybe it\\'s a 5? \\n\\nWait, the examples for 5 include references to external works or clear reasoning.

The justification here is that inconsistent spacing is visually unappealing, which is a common-sense argument in academic writing. \\n\\nHowever, the reviewer doesn\\'t reference any specific guidelines or external standards (like a journal\\'s formatting rules) that require consistent spacing. They also don\\'t provide examples beyond stating that some entries have spaces and others don\\'t. The claim is about the effect on beauty, which is somewhat subjective. But the core issue—the inconsistency itself—is an observable fact. \\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s point is somewhat supported by pointing out the inconsistency, but the link between that inconsistency and the impact on the tables\\' aesthetic is based on common sense. Since the reviewer isn\\'t providing explicit references or more detailed explanations, this might fall into a lower score. \\n\\nComparing to the scoring examples: \\n\\n- A score of 2 (Borderline Verifiable) would be if the support is vague. Here, the reviewer is specific about the tables and the issue, so maybe higher. \\n\\n- A score of 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) requires some support but missing elements. The reviewer\\'s claim is specific but lacks external references or explicit examples beyond the existence of the inconsistency. \\n\\nWait, but the reviewer is providing a concrete example (some entries have spaces, others don\\'t). That\\'s a specific observation. The problem is that the effect on \"beauty\" is subjective. However, the core issue (inconsistency) is factual. The justification is logical (inconsistency is bad for presentation), so maybe this is at least a 3 or 4?\\n\\nAlternatively, since the reviewer is just stating the inconsistency exists and that it affects beauty, but without more, maybe it\\'s a 3. Because the reasoning is there (inconsistency is bad for presentation), but the connection is not explicitly spelled out beyond common sense. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had said \"Inconsistent formatting distracts readers and reduces professionalism, as per APA guidelines,\" that would be a 4 or 5. Since they didn\\'t, but they did point out the inconsistency, perhaps it\\'s a 3. \\n\\nWait, looking at the scoring criteria for 3: \"the comment provides support for its claim, but key elements are missing, such as specific examples, detailed explanations, or supporting references. Authors must make a significant effort to follow the justification.\"\\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer provided specific tables (Table 2 and 3) and the exact issue (spaces between accuracy and standard deviation inconsistency). The key element missing might be the explicit link between the inconsistency and the aesthetic impact. But since that\\'s a common-sense argument in academic writing, maybe it\\'s sufficient for a 4?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the reviewer\\'s point is just a simple observation without deeper reasoning. The claim is that the inconsistency affects beauty, but the reviewer didn\\'t explain why that\\'s the case beyond stating it. So the justification is minimal. \\n\\nComparing to example for 2: \"The two used datasets are very related, where the input sequence is cocktail party speech...\" which got a 4. That example had a logical explanation. Here, the reviewer\\'s explanation is brief. \\n\\nAnother example for 3: \"The evaluative framework appears somewhat limited in scope...\" which was scored 3 because it lacked specifics. The current review point is similar in that it points out an issue but doesn\\'t elaborate beyond stating the problem. \\n\\nTherefore, I think this would be a 3: Somewhat Verifiable. The reviewer provides a specific observation (inconsistent spacing in tables) and a logical claim that this affects presentation quality. However, the connection between the inconsistency and the aesthetic impact isn\\'t elaborated beyond common sense, and there\\'s no reference to guidelines. The authors can see the inconsistency, but the reasoning is minimal. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the existence of the inconsistency is the claim, then it\\'s verifiable. But the claim is about the effect on beauty. Since the reviewer states the inconsistency exists and that it affects beauty, the support is there. Maybe it\\'s a 4? \\n\\nWait, the scoring for 4 says \"the claim is sufficiently supported but has minor gaps.\" The minor gaps here could be the lack of explicit references or more detailed explanation of how exactly the inconsistency impacts beauty. But the reviewer\\'s point is straightforward. \\n\\nHmm. Maybe a 4. The reviewer\\'s reasoning is logical (inconsistency is bad for aesthetics), and they pointed out the specific tables and the exact inconsistency. The only missing element is perhaps a reference to a style guide, but that\\'s not always necessary. \\n\\nAlternatively, since the claim is about the effect on \"beauty,\" which is subjective, but the core issue (inconsistency) is factual, maybe the reviewer\\'s claim is mostly verifiable. \\n\\nI think I\\'m leaning towards 3 or 4.']\n",

Let\\'s break down each part of the review point.\\n\\nStarting with the \"antecedent missing\" issue. The reviewer is pointing out that the phrase \"both tasks\" doesn\\'t have a clear antecedent. To verify this claim, the authors can check the text around line 781 to see if the tasks are properly introduced before being referenced. This is a specific instance; the reviewer is indicating a precise location (line 781) and the exact problem. The justification here is based on common sense in writing—proper antecedents are necessary for clarity. The reviewer isn\\'t providing external references or complex reasoning, but it\\'s a clear, logical point based on standard writing practices. So this part is somewhat verifiable because the authors can go to line 781 and check the antecedent. However, the reviewer didn\\'t explain why the antecedent is missing, just pointed it out. Maybe more explanation could help, but the existence of the missing antecedent is a factual issue they can check.\\n\\nNext, the references formatting. The reviewer gives examples of specific references that need checking: Grice and Sorower et al for capitalization, and VerbNet for bibliographic details. These are concrete examples. The authors can look up the references in their bibliography to see if they follow the correct capitalization (like proper nouns) and if VerbNet has all necessary details (e.g., authors, year, title, etc.). The reviewer\\'s claim here is based on common knowledge of citation standards, so they don\\'t need to cite a source. The authors can verify these points by checking their references against style guides or the journal\\'s guidelines. This part is also somewhat verifiable because the reviewer provided specific references to check. However, without knowing the exact formatting rules they\\'re referring to, the authors might need to infer, but it\\'s still a clear instruction.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the reviewer\\'s claims are specific and actionable. They point to line numbers and specific references, which allows the authors to verify the issues. However, the justifications rely on standard practices without explicit references or detailed explanations. The reviewer didn\\'t, for example, cite a style guide for the capitalization or explain what\\'s missing in VerbNet\\'s entry. But since these are common formatting issues, the authors can check them using their own knowledge or guidelines. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria, a score of 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) would be appropriate here. The claims are supported by pointing out specific instances but lack detailed explanations or references. The authors can verify the antecedent issue by checking the text at line 781 and the references by looking at the listed entries, but the reasoning is based on standard practices without explicit citations. There\\'s no major gap, but some minor effort is needed to confirm. However, since the reviewer provided concrete examples and specific locations, it might lean towards 4 (Mostly Verifiable).

Let\\'s recall the scoring guidelines. The key is whether the claim is supported by justification, logical reasoning, common sense, or references. \\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s claim is that the section is confusing because explanations are intertwined. The justification given is that separating them into paragraphs would help. But does the reviewer provide any reasoning beyond that? \\n\\nThe reviewer mentions that splitting into separate paragraphs for each feature type would improve coherence. That\\'s a suggestion, but is there a logical reasoning or common sense basis here? Well, organizing related features into separate sections is a common practice in writing to enhance clarity. So maybe that\\'s using common sense in the field. \\n\\nHowever, the reviewer doesn\\'t provide specific examples of where exactly the explanations are tangled, or perhaps references to other works that structure features this way. The reasoning is somewhat there (separate paragraphs for each feature type would help), but it\\'s a bit vague. \\n\\nLooking at the examples given in the scoring criteria. For instance, a score of 2 (borderline) is when there\\'s some support but it\\'s vague. A score of 3 (somewhat verifiable) requires support but missing key elements. \\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s suggestion is based on the idea that separating features into their own paragraphs would help, which is a common sense approach. However, without pointing out specific instances where the intertwining causes confusion, it might be borderline. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer is using common sense (organizing features separately is better), then maybe it\\'s a 3? Because common sense is one of the verification methods. \\n\\nWait, the examples for 3 include something like \"the evaluative framework appears limited in scope\" with some concrete numbers. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a structural issue and suggesting a fix based on common writing practices. The claim is that the current structure is confusing because explanations are intertwined. The justification is the suggestion to separate them. \\n\\nIs that enough? The reasoning is there but maybe not fully explained. The reviewer doesn\\'t give an example of a confusing part, just states that explanations are intertwined. So maybe it\\'s borderline between 2 and 3. \\n\\nThe instruction says if it\\'s borderline, think if it helps the author improve. The suggestion here does help the author by pointing to reorganizing sections, even if the justification is brief. But does the claim that the explanations are intertwined have enough support?\\n\\nThe reviewer might be using their own experience in reading the paper, so perhaps it\\'s a bit subjective. But the suggestion is actionable. \\n\\nLooking at the examples given for score 2 (borderline): \"The two used datasets are very related...\" which is similar in that it\\'s a claim about the datasets without specifics. The example for 3: \"The evaluative framework appears somewhat limited...\" which is a claim with some reasoning but missing specifics. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer\\'s claim is that the explanations are intertwined leading to confusion.

However, the mention of [1] implies that those baselines are relevant and strong, which is a form of external reference supporting the claim. \\n\\nBut wait, does the reviewer provide enough reasoning? They state that MCNC \"should have many strong baselines that are not compared here,\" which is a claim. The reference to [1] supports that those baselines are indeed strong. So the reviewer is using an external source to back their point. \\n\\nIs there any logical reasoning here? Yes, because if [1] has strong baselines, then not comparing to them makes the current results less convincing. The reviewer\\'s point is that the paper\\'s comparison is incomplete without them, which is a valid argument. \\n\\nHowever, the comment is a bit brief. It just mentions [1] but doesn\\'t elaborate on why those baselines are strong or how their absence affects the results. For example, if [1] is a well-known work with state-of-the-art methods, that\\'s a strong point. But without more context, the authors might need to know why [1] is important. \\n\\nBut since the reviewer provided the reference, the authors can check [1] themselves.

However, the justification is brief and could be strengthened by explicitly explaining why the baselines in [1] are critical or how their absence affects the conclusions. The lack of further elaboration or examples introduces minor gaps, making the claim mostly verifiable but not fully robust.  \\n\\n**Score:** 4 (Mostly Verifiable)  \\n\\n**Explanation:**  \\nThe claim is supported by an explicit reference to [1], indicating that the reviewer has specific, credible baselines in mind. This meets the criteria for \"external references\" and logical reasoning (since omitting strong baselines weakens comparisons).

The claim here is that the authors need to provide more details about the experts and the rationale for using them. The reviewer is pointing out a gap in the paper's methodology regarding the annotation process. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria, the comment is making a claim that the paper lacks justification for using experts. The reviewer is asking for specific information: type of experts, differences from non-experts, and challenges. The justification provided by the reviewer is that the current description is insufficient, but they don't offer their own evidence or references. They are pointing out missing elements in the paper rather than providing external validation. \\n\\nThe reviewer's reasoning is based on the need for methodological transparency and justification, which is a common expectation in academic papers. However, the comment itself doesn't cite prior work that establishes why expert annotation is necessary or provide examples of what such a justification should include. It's more of a request for additional information rather than a critique supported by external evidence or logical reasoning beyond the paper's content. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scoring criteria, this seems similar to a borderline case.

Were the experts linguistic experts or domain experts? Was annotation any different from what non-experts would do? Did it introduce any linguistic challenges?  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment claims that the paper lacks sufficient justification for using experts in the annotation process and requests specific details (e.g., expertise type, differences from non-experts, linguistic challenges). While the reviewer raises valid questions about methodology and transparency, the critique itself does not provide external references, logical reasoning, or common-sense validation to substantiate why these details are critical. The justification hinges on the expectation that such information is necessary for methodological rigor, but this is presented as an implicit assumption rather than a claim supported by explicit evidence or established practices. The questions posed are reasonable, but the reviewer does not explain *why* the absence of this information undermines the work (e.g., citing prior studies on expert annotation benefits or pitfalls).

For instance, when a reviewer cited specific papers to show that a method wasn\\'t novel, that was a 5. Similarly, here, the reviewer is providing a specific reference to support the claim that the authors should include it. \\n\\nHowever, the claim here is more of a suggestion rather than a critique of the paper\\'s existing claims. The aspect is about verifying claims made in the review. The reviewer\\'s claim is that the reference is relevant, so they need to justify that. The mention of the paper\\'s title and authors is a reference, but is that enough? \\n\\nIn the scoring criteria, external references are a valid verification method. Since the reviewer provides a specific citation, that\\'s a form of substantiation. Therefore, this should be a 5 because the claim (that this reference is relevant) is supported by citing the work. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the reviewer didn\\'t explain why it\\'s relevant. The title gives some context, but perhaps the reviewer assumes the reader knows. However, the aspect\\'s definition says that the justification can be through referencing external sources. Since the reviewer is pointing to a specific paper in the field, that\\'s sufficient. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had just said \"you should cite more work on explainable NLP\" without a reference, that would be lower. But here, they provided a concrete example, so it\\'s better. \\n\\nLooking at the example given for score 5 in the instructions: \"The paper’s main idea of mixing transfer-based and query-based attacks is not novel. Several papers [9, 19] have already explored this concept.\" That\\'s similar here; the reviewer is pointing to a specific paper as a relevant reference. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5 because the claim (that this reference is relevant to their work on explainable NLP datasets) is supported by citing the paper. The reviewer\\'s claim is that the authors should include this reference, and they back it up by naming the paper, which is a valid external reference. \\n\\nWait, but the review point is phrased as \"Additional reference regarding...\" which is more of a suggestion rather than a critique. The aspect is about evaluating the verifiability of the reviewer\\'s claims. The claim here is that the reference is relevant.

      "[\"Okay, let's tackle this review point. The reviewer is pointing out two issues with the model's presentation. First, they ask about the pooling method used for embedding features at line 397. Second, they question the clarity of Equation (7) in line 472, specifically whether E_i refers to the type or identity of AC i, and note that the left-hand side (LHS) might need to be a conditional probability.\\n\\nStarting with the first point about the pooling method. The reviewer is pointing out a lack of clarity in the description. The claim here is that the method isn't specified, which makes it unclear. The justification is that without knowing the pooling method, readers (including the authors when revising) can't fully understand or replicate the approach. However, the reviewer isn't providing external references or logical reasoning beyond pointing out the omission. They are just stating that the information is missing. \\n\\nMoving to the second point regarding Equation (7). The reviewer is questioning the definition of E_i and the structure of the equation. They suggest that the equation might be missing a conditional probability on the LHS. This requires some subject matter knowledge. The reviewer is using their understanding of the field to point out a possible error or ambiguity. They’re not just stating a problem but explaining why it's an issue—like the variables need clear definitions and the equation structure might be incorrect. \\n\\nNow, applying the verifiability criteria. For the first issue, the reviewer is correct that the pooling method isn't detailed, but their claim is based on the absence of information in the paper. Since they’re pointing out an omission rather than providing evidence against it, this part is more of an observation. However, the second part of the comment about the equation involves a more detailed analysis. The reviewer is using their knowledge to highlight a potential flaw in the equation's formulation, suggesting that without clarifying E_i and the conditional probability, the equation is unclear. \\n\\nThe key here is whether the reviewer provided sufficient justification. For the first point, it's a straightforward request for more details, which is a valid point but doesn't have external support—it’s just pointing out missing info. The second part does involve some logical reasoning based on common practices (like needing to define variables clearly and correct probability notation). \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria: \\n\\n- A score of 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) requires some support but missing key elements. The reviewer's points are valid and based on the paper's content, but they don't reference external sources or provide deeper explanations beyond pointing out the gaps. \\n\\n- A score of 4 (Mostly Verifiable) would need more solid reasoning or references. The equation part does have some reasoning, but maybe not enough. The first part is just an observation without deeper justification. \\n\\nHmm, maybe 3? Because the reviewer is using their understanding (common sense in the field) to say that variables must be clearly defined and equations should be precise. The equation's issue is somewhat justified by pointing out the ambiguity in E_i and the structure. However, the reviewer\"]\n",

The key claims here are that the hypotheses aren\\'t phrased optimally for testing and that the paper doesn\\'t study them further, which the reviewer finds misleading and disappointing.\\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria, I need to check how well the reviewer supports these claims. The reviewer mentions that the hypotheses in lines 078-086 aren\\'t phrased well for testing. They also point out that the hypotheses aren\\'t discussed again in the paper, which makes the omission noticeable. \\n\\nThe justification here is that the hypotheses are present but not adequately addressed. The reviewer is using their understanding of research standards—hypotheses should be testable and discussed—to argue that the paper falls short. However, the reviewer doesn\\'t provide specific examples of how the hypotheses could be better phrased or references to established methods for testing such hypotheses. They also don\\'t cite external work that might show how similar hypotheses were handled in other studies. \\n\\nThe claim that the hypotheses aren\\'t studied is somewhat supported by pointing out their absence in later sections, but without explicit references to where they should have been discussed or data that should have been included, the justification is a bit vague. The reviewer\\'s assertion about it being \"misleading\" is an opinion but lacks concrete evidence beyond the absence of discussion. \\n\\nComparing this to the scoring scale, the claim is somewhat supported by the observation that the hypotheses aren\\'t revisited, but the reasoning could be more detailed. The reviewer mentions that the ideas are valuable but doesn\\'t back that up with specifics. Since there\\'s some logical reasoning (hypotheses should be tested and discussed), but missing elements like examples or references, this might fall into the \"Somewhat Verifiable\" category (score 3). Alternatively, if the lack of further discussion is clear enough, maybe it\\'s a 2? Wait, the reviewer does point out the exact lines where the hypotheses are mentioned and notes their absence elsewhere. That\\'s a specific example. However, the critique about phrasing not being optimal for testing is a bit vague. The reviewer doesn\\'t explain how the phrasing is suboptimal or suggest improvements with evidence. \\n\\nHmm, so the key points are: \\n- The hypotheses are present in lines 078-086 but not discussed further. \\n- The reviewer\\'s claim is that this omission is misleading and that deeper study was needed. \\n\\nThe support here is the reviewer pointing out the lack of discussion, which is a specific part of the paper.

The reviewer is proposing that for each PCFG with rank r, the authors should add a baseline smaller PCFG. This baseline would have a state size of r and use learned matrices for parameters H, I, J, K, L. The reviewer mentions that parsing F1 might not be comparable, but perplexity can still be used for comparison.\\n\\nNow, according to the verifiability criteria, I need to assess how well this claim is supported. Let\\'s look at the verification methods: logical reasoning, common sense in the field, or external references. \\n\\nThe reviewer provides a specific method for creating the baseline, detailing the parameterization of matrices with specific dimensions. They also explain that while one metric (parsing F1) might not be directly comparable, another (perplexity) is still viable. This shows logical reasoning because they\\'re explaining why the comparison is possible despite some limitations. \\n\\nHowever, the reviewer doesn\\'t cite any external sources or prior work that supports this approach.

      "[\"Okay, let's tackle this review point. The reviewer is commenting on Figure 3 and the authors' statement that both CNNs and ViTs benefit similarly from increased model capacity. The reviewer disagrees, pointing out specific instances where ViT (DeiT) models don't outperform smaller versions on certain datasets, while CNNs do show consistent improvement except on ISIC2019.\\n\\nFirst, I need to assess the verifiability of this claim. The reviewer's main argument is that the authors' conclusion isn't accurate because the data in Figure 3 shows different trends between CNNs and ViTs. To check verifiability, I should see if the reviewer provides enough evidence or reasoning to back this up.\\n\\nThe reviewer gives specific examples: DeiT-B doesn't outperform DeiT-T and DeiT-S on several datasets, and mentions that the 0.1% improvement isn't significant. They also note that CNNs generally improve with capacity except on one dataset. These are concrete observations from the figure, so the reviewer is pointing to specific data points. \\n\\nHowever, the justification could be strengthened by explaining why the 0.1% isn't significant (maybe referencing a statistical test or common thresholds?), or by explicitly stating how the trends in the figure contradict the authors' claim. Still, the reviewer does reference the figure and specific models/datasets, which allows the authors to check the data themselves. \\n\\nThe claim is supported by direct reference to the figure's data, so the reasoning is there. But maybe the reviewer could have provided more context on why the lack of improvement in ViTs is significant compared to CNNs. Still, the examples are specific enough. \\n\\nComparing to the scoring criteria, this seems to be mostly verifiable. The reviewer provides logical reasoning and points to specific data in the paper, but perhaps lacks a bit more in-depth analysis (like statistical significance details or direct comparison metrics). So maybe a 4? Or is it a 5 because the data is explicit?\\n\\nWait, the examples are specific (APTOS2019, ISIC2019, CheXpert) and the reviewer is referencing Figure 3 directly. The reasoning is there: the author's conclusion that both benefit similarly is contradicted by the fact that ViTs don't improve as much. The reviewer's points are tied to the data in the paper, so the justification is solid. \\n\\nBut the 0.1% part: the reviewer says it's not significant, but without a reference to how significance is determined here, maybe that's a minor gap. Still, overall, the evidence is there. \\n\\nLooking at the 5 score examples, they often have references or explicit data. Here, the data is from the paper's own figure, so it's internal. The reviewer is using the paper's own data to argue their point, which is strong. So maybe 5? \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had cited other works or explained why 0.1% is insignificant, that would push it to 5. Since they mention it without further backing, maybe 4. Hmm.\\n\\nThe scoring criteria for 5 requires explicit, sufficient evidence. The reviewer's points are explicit and tied to the figure, so perhaps 5. But the mention of 0.1% being insignificant without explanation might leave a minor gap. \\n\\nWait, the examples given are specific enough. The reviewer is using the data presented in the paper to challenge the authors' conclusion. Since the figure is part of the paper, the reviewer's claim is fully supported by the data in the paper. Therefore, this should be a 5. \\n\\nBut let me check the 5 example again. The 5 examples include references to external works or clear reasoning. Here, the reasoning is based on the paper's own data. The reviewer's argument is logical and points to specific parts of the paper's data. \\n\\nTherefore, I think this is a 5. But maybe the reviewer could have provided more explicit numbers or a clearer statistical argument. However, the key is that the claim is supported by the data in the figure, so the authors can verify it by looking at Figure 3. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the authors' figure's data indeed shows those trends, then the reviewer's claim is fully verifiable through the paper's own content.

Given that the difference between the two proposed systems is only a few percentage points, it brings into question the conclusion that the direct model is clearly the better of the two (but they still are both demonstrably superior to the baseline).\"\\n\\nBreaking it down, the reviewer is making a claim that the conclusion about the direct model being better might not be valid because the training data sizes differ significantly, and the performance difference is small. \\n\\nNow, applying the scoring criteria. Let\\'s see:\\n\\nThe reviewer points out two things: the data discrepancy and the small performance gap. They argue this casts doubt on the conclusion. \\n\\nLooking at the verification methods, the reviewer uses logical reasoning here. They connect the data amount difference to the conclusion\\'s validity. That\\'s a form of logical support. Also, they mention the performance difference is only a few percentage points, which is a specific detail. \\n\\nHowever, does the reviewer provide any references or more concrete examples? The comment doesn\\'t cite any specific studies or common practices that would back up why the data discrepancy matters in this context. The reasoning is logical but might be missing some specifics. \\n\\nThe claim is that the conclusion is questionable because of these factors. The reviewer isn\\'t just making a vague statement; they\\'re pointing to specific elements (data size, performance margin). But is there enough there for the authors to verify the reasoning? \\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s argument is somewhat supported but might lack explicit references or more detailed analysis. For example, if they had cited research showing that data size impacts model performance in such a way, that would push it to a higher score. Alternatively, if they explained why a few percentage points aren\\'t significant given the data difference, that could add more. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scoring criteria. For a 4 (Mostly Verifiable), the claim is sufficiently supported but has minor gaps. The reviewer here provides specific points (data amount and performance gap) which are concrete. But the justification could be stronger with more explanation or references. \\n\\nAlternatively, a 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) would be if key elements are missing. Here, the reviewer does give specific aspects (data size difference and small margin), so maybe it\\'s more towards 4. \\n\\nWait, the examples for 4 include things like pointing out that datasets are related, which is a logical point but could use more detail.

The reasoning is there, but maybe the connection between data size and the conclusion\\'s validity isn\\'t spelled out in more depth. \\n\\nHmm, so maybe it\\'s a 4? Or a 3? Let me think again. \\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s claim is that the conclusion (direct model is better) is questionable because the data used was much less, yet the performance difference is small. The justification is that if the direct model was trained on less data and only has a small edge, maybe the conclusion isn\\'t solid. \\n\\nThis is logical reasoning. The reviewer is using common sense about data\\'s impact on model performance. They might be implying that with more data, the other model might have done better, but without more data, the difference isn\\'t enough to claim superiority. \\n\\nSince the reviewer provides specific elements (data amount, performance gap), even without references, this seems to be a 4.

That\\'s a common-sense argument in academic research—data availability is crucial for reproducibility. But does the reviewer back this up with references or more detailed reasoning?\\n\\nThe comment doesn\\'t cite any specific policies or prior works that emphasize data sharing. It\\'s a logical point based on standard practices, but maybe not explicitly referenced. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scoring criteria:\\n\\n- A score of 2 (Borderline) requires some support but vague or insufficient. The reviewer here states the fact (dataset isn\\'t available) and the implication (cautious approach needed). The reasoning is there, but it\\'s minimal. \\n\\n- A score of 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) would need more missing elements. But here, the core justification is present. \\n\\nWait, the example for 2 includes things like \"I have read a paper that tried to do the same thing...\" which is vague. Here, the reviewer\\'s point is more factual. The claim is about the dataset\\'s availability, which is a concrete fact. The support is the logical connection between data availability and the validity of the contribution. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s a 3 because the reviewer could have provided more context, like why data availability is important, but that\\'s common knowledge. Since the reviewer\\'s reasoning is based on common sense (established practices require data sharing for reproducibility), that might push it to 4? \\n\\nWait, the scoring criteria for 4 says the claim is sufficiently supported but has minor gaps. The reviewer\\'s point is clear and logical, but maybe lacks explicit references to guidelines or policies that require data sharing. However, common sense in the field might be enough for a 4. \\n\\nAlternatively, since the reviewer is just stating the fact (dataset isn\\'t available) and the implication, but not providing external references or more detailed reasoning beyond that, maybe it\\'s a 2. \\n\\nHmm. Let me check the examples again. The example for 2 is \"the transfer tasks are too artificial...\" with some explanation but still vague. The example for 3 is \"evaluative framework appears limited...\" which is somewhat justified but missing specifics. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer\\'s claim is that the dataset isn\\'t available, so the contribution should be viewed with caution. The justification is that without the dataset, others can\\'t verify. That\\'s a logical common-sense argument. Since the reviewer is using established practice (data should be available for reproducibility), this is common sense verification. \\n\\nLooking at the criteria for 4: \"The comment’s claim is sufficiently supported but has minor gaps.\" The minor gap here is maybe not citing a specific policy or study that emphasizes data sharing. But the reasoning is solid. \\n\\nAlternatively, since the reviewer is just stating the fact (dataset not available) and the implication without further details, maybe it\\'s a 2. \\n\\nWait, the example for 2 includes \"the momentum term could be a confounding factor...\" which is a bit vague. The current comment\\'s reasoning is more concrete. \\n\\nComparing to the 4 example: \"The statistical analysis appears incorrect because the p-values reported for the t-tests do not align with standard thresholds...\" Here, the reviewer points out a specific issue (p-values not aligning with thresholds), which is concrete. \\n\\nIn our case, the reviewer points out the dataset isn\\'t available, which is a concrete fact. The implication is based on common sense. Since the reviewer is using common sense (established practices), that\\'s a valid verification method. \\n\\nSo maybe this is a 4? The claim is sufficiently supported by common sense reasoning, but could have minor gaps like not citing specific guidelines. \\n\\nAlternatively, the example for 5 includes references to external works. Here, there are no references, so maybe it\\'s 4. \\n\\nAlternatively, the example for 5 has clear reasoning with references. Since this one lacks references but has common sense, perhaps it\\'s 4. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the claim is that \"the promised dataset has not been made available,\" that\\'s a factual claim that can be verified by checking if the dataset is indeed not available. The reviewer\\'s claim is verifiable through checking the dataset\\'s availability. The implication about the cautious approach is logical. \\n\\nWait, the verifiability is about how well the reviewer supports their claim. The reviewer\\'s claim is that the dataset isn\\'t available, so the contribution should be cautious. The support is the']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is saying that the novelty is limited because the proposed method is too similar to existing attentional modules from previous works [1,2,3], and the group attention design is related to ResNeSt [4], which isn\\'t discussed. They mention that while those earlier works didn\\'t test on object detection or instance segmentation, the structures are still similar.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check the verifiability. The reviewer cites specific references [1,2,3,4], which is good because it gives concrete sources. They also point out that the group attention is related to ResNeSt but not discussed. That\\'s a specific claim with references. The argument is that the structures are similar even if the application areas differ. \\n\\nThe reviewer isn\\'t just making a vague statement; they\\'re pointing to specific prior works and a specific design (group attention) linked to ResNeSt. The fact that they mention the lack of discussion in the paper about ResNeSt adds another layer. The references provide a basis for verifying the similarity claims. \\n\\nHowever, the reviewer doesn\\'t go into the exact structural similarities or provide examples of how the attention modules are alike. They could have explained more about the specific components that are similar or how the group attention in ResNeSt is analogous. But the presence of the references allows the authors to check those works and see the comparisons themselves. \\n\\nSince the claim is supported by citing specific prior works and pointing out an omission (not discussing ResNeSt), even if the explanation is brief, it\\'s more than just an unsupported assertion. The references make it possible for the authors to verify the claims by checking those papers. \\n\\nComparing to the scoring criteria, this seems like a 4 or 5. The references are there, but maybe the explanation is a bit light on specifics beyond the citations. The reviewer could have elaborated more on the structural similarities, but the references provide enough for verification. \\n\\nWait, the examples for a 5 include things like referencing specific works and explaining how they relate. The example given in the 5 score mentions citing specific papers and explaining the contribution\\'s overlap. Here, the reviewer does cite the papers and mentions the group attention\\'s relation to ResNeSt. So maybe this is a 5. But the reviewer says \"the overall structures between these modules and the one proposed are pretty similar\" — that\\'s a bit vague. They don\\'t detail exactly how they\\'re similar, just that they are. \\n\\nHmm, the 4 score examples include things like \"the statistical analysis appears incorrect because the p-values...\" which is a specific claim with some reasoning. The 5 examples have more detailed explanations with references. Here, the references are there, but the explanation is somewhat general. \\n\\nSo maybe it\\'s a 4. The reviewer provides some justification with references but could have gone into more detail about the structural similarities. The claim is supported by references but lacks specific examples of how the structures are similar beyond the existence of the prior works. \\n\\nAlternatively, since the references are provided and the claim is about the structures being similar, which the authors can check via the cited works, maybe it\\'s a 5. The key is whether the references are sufficient to verify. Since the reviewer points to the specific prior works and mentions the group attention\\'s relation to ResNeSt, even without more detail, the authors can look at those and see the similarities. \\n\\nI think this is a 5 because the']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is commenting on Figure 3e and the choice of what\\'s being illustrated. The claim here is that since the preactivation values of two networks are the same membrane potentials, their output cosine similarity should be very high. The reviewer is questioning why the authors didn\\'t instead show the results of the latter loss term from Equation 13.\\n\\nFirst, I need to break down the components. The reviewer is pointing out a logical connection between the preactivation values and the cosine similarity. They argue that because the membrane potentials (preactivation) are the same between the two networks, the cosine similarity between their outputs would naturally be high. Therefore, the reviewer suggests that the authors should instead present the results related to the latter part of the loss function in Equation 13, which might be a different measure that\\'s more informative.\\n\\nNow, applying the verifiability criteria. The reviewer is providing a logical reasoning here: same preactivations lead to high cosine similarity, so showing that might not add much. The justification is based on understanding the relationship between the variables. But does the reviewer back this up sufficiently?\\n\\nThe reviewer mentions that the preactivation values are the same, so their cosine similarity would be high. This is a logical deduction, but is there any explicit reference or example given? The reviewer doesn\\'t cite any external sources or specific data from the paper. However, the reasoning is based on common sense in the field—if two vectors are the same, their cosine similarity is 1. So that part is self-evident.\\n\\nThe suggestion to use the latter loss term in Equation 13 is also based on this logic. The reviewer is implying that the current figure doesn\\'t effectively show the meaningful part of the loss, and the authors should instead focus on the other term which might capture a more critical aspect of the model\\'s performance. The justification here is logical but perhaps a bit brief. The reviewer doesn\\'t explain why the latter term is more important or reference any specific part of the paper that discusses this term\\'s significance.\\n\\nSo, considering the scoring criteria: \\n\\n- A score of 4 (Mostly Verifiable) would require that the claim is supported sufficiently but with minor gaps. The logical reasoning here is there, but maybe the reviewer could have elaborated more on why the latter loss term is better or provided a bit more context. \\n\\n- A score of 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) would mean key elements are missing. The reviewer\\'s point is logical but perhaps lacks specifics about the loss term\\'s role or impact. \\n\\nWait, the reviewer does reference Equation 13, so there\\'s a specific element. The reasoning is that since the first part of the loss (cosine similarity) is redundant due to the preactivation being the same, the latter term is more relevant. The reviewer\\'s logic is based on the structure of the loss function and the variables involved. Since they reference Equation 13, that provides a concrete point in the paper to check. \\n\\nTherefore, the justification is logical and tied to the paper\\'s content, but perhaps it\\'s a bit concise. The reviewer didn\\'t provide external references, but the reasoning is grounded in the paper\\'s own equations. The gap here might be that they don\\'t explain why the latter term is important beyond the redundancy of the first. However, the core claim is supported by the logical connection presented. \\n\\nSo, this seems like a 4: Mostly Verifiable. The reviewer provides a logical basis but could have elaborated more on the importance of the latter term. Alternatively, if the reviewer\\'s logic is sufficient without needing more details, maybe even a 5? Wait, the examples for 5 include things like citing specific references or clear reasoning. Here, the reasoning is clear but perhaps not as detailed. Since they mention Equation 13, that\\'s specific, but maybe the key is that the reviewer\\'s argument is based on the inherent properties (same preactivations leading to high cosine similarity), which is a common-sense argument in the field. \\n\\nYes, that\\'s common sense. So using that as verification, plus referencing the equation, this would be a 5? Hmm. Let me check the examples again. \\n\\nLooking at the 5 examples, one of them is about referencing specific papers. Another is pointing out that the main idea is not novel with references. The third example is about the statistical analysis being incorrect with p-values not aligning with thresholds. \\n\\nIn the current case, the reviewer\\'s point is based on logical reasoning (common sense in the field) and references the equation in the paper. That should be sufficient for a 5. Wait, but the reviewer is making a claim that the figure is not showing the right thing. The justification is that because of the preactivation equivalence, the cosine similarity is high, so the figure\\'s current content isn\\'t useful. The reviewer then suggests showing the latter loss term instead. \\n\\nThe reasoning is logical, and the reviewer provides a direct link to the equation. The only missing element might be an explicit statement about why the latter term is more meaningful, but perhaps that\\'s implied. Since the reviewer is pointing out that the current choice is redundant, the reasoning is clear enough. \\n\\nTherefore, I think this should be a 5. Wait, but in the scoring criteria for 5, it requires explicit, sufficient, and robust evidence. The reviewer\\'s argument is based on the inherent properties of cosine similarity when vectors are the same. That\\'s a logical and common-sense argument, so that\\'s sufficient. The mention of Equation 13 provides the specific reference in the paper. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s a 4 because the reviewer could have explained more about the latter loss term\\'s significance. But given that the core reasoning is solid and tied to the paper\\'s content, I think this is a 4 or 5. \\n\\nLooking at the example for 4: \"The statistical analysis appears incorrect because the p-values reported for the t-tests do not align with standard thresholds for significance.\" That\\'s a clear logical point without needing references. The current case is similar but with a reference to an equation. \\n\\nAnother example for 5 includes referencing external papers. Here, the reviewer is referencing the paper\\'s own equation. Since the reasoning is based on the equation\\'s structure and common sense, this aligns more with 5? \\n\\nWait, the example for 5 says \"specific and relevant references to external works or data.\" Here, the reference is internal (Equation 13), but still specific. The scoring criteria for 5 includes \"logical and unassailable common-sense arguments.\" The reviewer\\'s point about the preactivation leading to high cosine similarity is a common-sense argument in the field. \\n\\nTherefore, I think this should be a 5.

      "[\"Okay, let's tackle this review point. The reviewer is saying that the paper didn't compare their method with test-time adaptation (TTA) methods like [A-B]. They mention that TTA methods adjust model parameters, while the paper's approach adjusts input data. The reviewer is asking why data processing is better than parameter adjustment and suggests an experiment comparison.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check the verifiability. The claim here is that the paper lacks a necessary comparison, which might make their conclusion about superiority unconvincing. The reviewer references TTA methods [A-B], which is a start. They also explain that TTA focuses on parameters versus the paper's input data approach. \\n\\nThe justification includes a logical point: since both address similar problems (handling out-of-distribution data via different means), a comparison is needed. The reviewer is pointing out a gap in the experiments. However, do they provide enough support? They mention the existence of TTA methods but don't give specific results or details from [A-B] to show why the comparison is critical. The argument is logical, but maybe a bit vague on exactly how the comparison would prove superiority. \\n\\nThe reviewer does suggest that experiments are needed, so they are providing a reasoning path. The references to [A-B] help, but without specifics like performance metrics from those papers, it's a bit under-supported. The claim is that the paper's approach isn't proven superior without this comparison. The reviewer's logic is there, but maybe missing some concrete examples or explicit reasoning on why TTA is a strong baseline. \\n\\nComparing to the scoring criteria: \\n\\n- For a 4 (Mostly Verifiable), the claim is supported with logical reasoning and references but might have minor gaps. Here, the references are mentioned, but perhaps not fully explained. The reasoning is logical but could use more specifics. \\n\\n- A 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) would have key elements missing. The reviewer does have some references and a clear contrast between methods, so maybe it's better than 3. \\n\\nSince the reviewer provides the names of the TTA methods and explains the conceptual difference, that's a solid basis. The main gap is not providing explicit experimental data from [A-B], but the suggestion to do experiments is a valid point. The claim that the paper's approach isn't proven superior is well-reasoned. \\n\\nI think this is a 4. The references and logical reasoning are there, but could be more detailed. The author needs to compare, but the reviewer's point is mostly supported.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review point claims that the paper's approach lacks a comparison with test-time adaptation (TTA) methods like [A-B], which adjust model parameters instead of input data. The reviewer argues that without such a comparison, the superiority of the paper's data-processing approach over parameter adjustment remains unproven. The justification includes logical reasoning (both address out-of-distribution data but via different mechanisms) and references to TTA methods, which provides a basis for the claim. However, the reviewer does not explicitly cite specific results or metrics from [A-B] to illustrate why TTA is a critical baseline or how the comparison would concretely demonstrate superiority. While the reasoning is sound, the lack of detailed examples or explicit references to experimental results from prior work leaves minor gaps in verifiability.  \\n\\n**Score:** 4 (Mostly Verifiable)  \\n\\n**Explanation:**  \\nThe claim is well-supported by logical reasoning and references to TTA methods, but it could be strengthened with more explicit details (e.g., specific performance metrics from [A-B] or a clearer explanation of why TTA is a direct competitor).

      "['Okay, let me tackle this review point. The reviewer is pointing out that adding Conditional Batch Norm (CBN) to layer 2 along with layers 3 and 4 in Table 2 leads to worse performance on the GuessWhat?! dataset compared to when it\\'s only applied to layers 3 and 4. They\\'re asking the authors to explain why this might be happening.\\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate the verifiability of this comment based on the given criteria. The claim here is that applying CBN to layer 2 causes a performance drop. The reviewer\\'s support comes from the data in Table 2, which presumably shows this result. They\\'re not just making a vague statement but are referencing a specific table and experiment. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria, a score of 5 requires the claim to be fully verifiable with explicit evidence or references. Here, the reviewer is pointing to a specific result in the paper\\'s own data (Table 2) as the basis for their question. That\\'s a strong point because the authors can check Table 2 themselves to see the performance difference. The reviewer isn\\'t providing external references or detailed reasoning beyond pointing out the data discrepancy. \\n\\nHowever, the comment is phrased as a question asking the authors to explain the phenomenon. The reviewer isn\\'t offering their own explanation, just highlighting an observed result. The justification here is the empirical evidence from the table. Since the reviewer is using the paper\\'s own data to support their point, that\\'s a form of verification through the existing results. \\n\\nBut wait, the scoring criteria mention that verifiability can come from logical reasoning, common sense, or external references. In this case, the support is the data presented in the paper. The reviewer isn\\'t providing an explanation, just pointing out the discrepancy. The authors would need to analyze why adding CBN to layer 2 is causing issues, but the reviewer\\'s claim is based on the data\\'s existence. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scoring criteria: For a 4 (Mostly Verifiable), the claim has sufficient support but minor gaps. The reviewer here is using the paper\\'s data, which is solid, but maybe lacks an explanation or deeper analysis. However, the question is prompting the authors to provide that explanation, so the reviewer\\'s point is valid based on the data alone. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had provided a hypothesis (like \"maybe layer 2 has less relevant conditioning information\"), that might push it to a 5. But as it is, the support is the empirical result from Table 2. Since the reviewer is using the paper\\'s own data to back the claim, that\\'s sufficient for a high score. \\n\\nLooking at the example for 5: \"The first weakness of this work is that the wish list presented in the Introduction is broader than the actual techniques proposed. The key difference of this work lies in the dynamic prior, while previous work such as references [21] and [27] had already addressed the three properties mentioned.\" Here, the reviewer references specific prior works, which is similar to the face recognition example where a specific paper was cited. In the current case, the reviewer is pointing to their own table, which is part of the paper\\'s content. \\n\\nTherefore, since the reviewer\\'s claim is directly supported by the data in the paper (Table 2), this should be a 5. The justification is the empirical evidence from the table, which is explicit and directly verifiable by the authors. The reviewer isn\\'t just making a vague claim but is grounding it in the presented results. The minor gap here is that the reviewer doesn\\'t provide their own explanation, but the question is framed to ask the authors to explain, which is still a valid verification through the data itself. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the scoring criteria for 5 requires the reviewer to provide their own reasoning or references. Since the reviewer here is only pointing out the result without offering their own analysis, perhaps it\\'s not a 5. Let me check the 4 example again: \"The two used datasets are very related, where the input sequence is cocktail party speech, with one outputting the audio of each stream and the other producing the ASR output of each stream.\" Here, the reviewer explains the relationship between datasets, which is logical reasoning. \\n\\nIn the current case, the reviewer isn\\'t providing reasoning beyond the data. The support is the data itself. The claim is that the performance drops when adding CBN to layer 2, which is shown in Table 2. The reviewer\\'s claim is verifiable because the authors can check Table 2. The justification is the empirical result. \\n\\nLooking at the 5 example where they reference specific papers, the current case is similar but uses internal data instead of external references. Since the definition includes \"logical reasoning supports the claim\" and \"common sense knowledge in the field verifies the claim,\" maybe pointing to the table\\'s data is sufficient as logical reasoning (since it\\'s the authors\\' own data showing the effect). \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the lack of an explanation from the reviewer means it\\'s a 4. The reviewer\\'s point is that the phenomenon exists (verifiable via Table 2) but the reason why isn\\'t explored by the reviewer. However, the question is asking the authors to explain, so the claim itself (that the performance drops when adding layer 2) is fully supported by the data. The reviewer\\'s claim is about the observation, not the explanation. \\n\\nTherefore, the claim is fully verifiable because the reviewer points to specific data (Table 2) to back their assertion. The authors can verify the claim by looking at their own table, so this should be a 5. The minor gap would be if the reviewer didn\\'t specify which part of Table 2 shows this, but the question references Table 2 and the specific layers, so it\\'s clear. \\n\\nI think the correct score here is 5 because the claim is entirely supported by the data presented in the paper, making it fully verifiable.\\n</think>\\n\\n    rationale: The review comment highlights a specific result from Table 2, pointing out that applying Conditional Batch Norm (CBN) to layer 2 in addition to layers 3 and 4 leads to performance deterioration for the GuessWhat?! dataset compared to using CBN only on layers 3 and 4.

The reviewer\\'s claim is that the method can\\'t handle headpose. They back this up by mentioning that Gafni et al. already did it.

The reviewer doesn\\'t provide their own analysis or data, just points to another work. But that\\'s sufficient because the referenced work serves as external validation. The authors can check Gafni\\'s paper to see the approach and address why it wasn\\'t applicable here. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scoring criteria, this seems similar to the 5 examples where references are used to back claims.

This claim is supported by referencing specific studies, explaining that both spurious features and triggers involve rare artificial patterns affecting model behavior. The justification includes logical reasoning (e.g., \"a few training examples... large impact\") and explicit references to external works (Chen et al. 2017, Gu et al. 2019), which provide concrete examples of trigger types (random noise, single-pixel patterns).

The observation that language models reproduce the biases of the corpora on which they\\'re trained has been made at each step of the evolution of these models, from word2vec to BERT to ChatGPT, and so it\\'s unclear why this observation needs to once again be made using the authors\\' \"coarse\" methodology.  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer claims that the paper’s observation of political bias in LLMs is unoriginal and criticizes the methodology as \"coarse.\" The justification relies on **common sense knowledge** in the field, referencing the established pattern of bias in models like word2vec, BERT, and ChatGPT. This provides logical reasoning to support the claim that the result is not novel. However, the argument lacks **specific references** to prior studies demonstrating the bias in these models or explicit examples of how earlier works addressed similar questions with stronger methodologies. While the progression of models is logically sound, the absence of concrete citations or detailed comparisons leaves minor gaps. The claim is therefore **mostly verifiable** but not fully robust due to missing explicit evidence.  \\n\\n**Score:** 4  \\n**Reasoning:** The claim is supported by logical reasoning and common-sense knowledge of established biases in LLMs, but it would benefit from specific references or examples to fully substantiate the critique of the methodology’s coarseness and the lack of novelty. This aligns with the \"Mostly Verifiable\" category.']\n",

By reviewing your code and the details in the article, I can see that your workload is immense, however, the contribution of this article is incremental. My understanding is that it is essentially a combination of GraphRAG and GraphCare [1]. Furthermore, many key baselines were not cited. Since the authors mentioned that this paper focuses on RAG for EHR, some essential RAG algorithms should have been introduced, such as MedRetriever [2], and commonly used GraphRAG algorithms like KGRAG [3].  \\n\\n**rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer asserts that the paper’s contribution is incremental by combining existing methods (GraphRAG and GraphCare [1]) and omits key baselines (MedRetriever [2], KGRAG [3]). This claim is **fully verifiable** because the reviewer explicitly references specific prior works ([1], [2], [3]) to substantiate their critique. The mention of \"reviewing your code and the details in the article\" provides a basis for their assessment of the contribution’s incremental nature, and the cited works directly address the missing baselines. While the reviewer’s interpretation of the contribution’s novelty could be subjective, the supporting references and specific examples (e.g., MedRetriever and KGRAG) provide clear, actionable evidence for']\n",

That notation should be introduced beforehand. Fig.\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to analyze this based on the verifiability criteria. Let me break down the components of the review point.\\n\\nThe reviewer is pointing out two issues here. The first is about mathematical correctness, suggesting that the current phrasing or notation might not be correct and needs changing, unless altering it would complicate other equations. The second issue is about notation: using L_l instead of L without prior introduction.\\n\\nNow, applying the scoring criteria. For verifiability, we need to see if the reviewer provides justification, references, or logical reasoning to back their claims.\\n\\nStarting with the first part: \"I believe this needs to be changed to be mathematically correct...\" The reviewer states their belief but doesn\\'t provide specific mathematical reasoning, examples, or references why it\\'s incorrect. They mention a potential downside (making other equations messy), but that\\'s about the solution rather than the problem\\'s existence. So the claim here is that there\\'s a mathematical inaccuracy, but the justification is lacking.\\n\\nThe second part is about notation: \"why is it L_l instead of just L? That notation should be introduced beforehand.\" Here, the reviewer points out that the notation L_l is used without prior introduction. This is a valid point about clarity, but the justification is based on common sense (notation should be defined before use). However, the reviewer doesn\\'t reference any specific guidelines or examples where undefined notation caused confusion. The claim is that the notation is introduced late, but the support is minimal beyond stating the standard practice.\\n\\nLooking at the scoring scale:\\n\\n- A score of 1 is unverifiable if there\\'s no support. The first part of the comment lacks justification beyond the reviewer\\'s belief. The second part references a common practice but without explicit examples or references. \\n\\n- A score of 2 is borderline. The notation issue is somewhat supported by common sense (notation should be defined), but the mathematical correctness claim is not justified. However, the overall comment might be borderline because part of it uses common sense, but the main issue isn\\'t sufficiently supported.\\n\\n- A score of 3 is somewhat verifiable. Maybe the notation part is somewhat supported by common sense, but the mathematical correctness is not. Since the main claim (mathematical inaccuracy) isn\\'t backed up, this might lean towards 2 or 3.\\n\\nWait, let me think again. The notation part is a clear issue. The reviewer is pointing out that L_l is used without prior introduction, which is a standard requirement in papers. The justification here is based on common sense (notation should be defined before use). That part is somewhat supported. The first part about mathematical correctness is not supported. So the review has two parts: one with some support (notation) and one without (mathematical correctness). \\n\\nThe overall verifiability would depend on how much of the comment is supported. Since the main claim (mathematical correctness) isn\\'t supported, but the notation issue is somewhat supported via common sense, perhaps it\\'s borderline. The notation part is a valid point but only uses common sense without explicit references. The mathematical correctness is just an assertion without explanation. \\n\\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, a similar case might be the score 2 example where the reviewer mentions unclear momentum terms without explanation. So in this case, the notation issue is somewhat supported by common sense, but the mathematical correctness isn\\'t. Since the main thrust of the review point includes an unsupported claim, maybe it\\'s borderline (score 2). Alternatively, if the notation part alone is enough for score 3, but combined with the other part, it might be lower. \\n\\nAlternatively, the notation part is a valid point with common sense (so 2 or 3), but the mathematical correctness part is 1. Since the review combines both, maybe the overall score is 2 because part of it is somewhat supported but not fully. \\n\\nWait, let me check the scoring criteria again:\\n\\nScore 2: Borderline Verifiable. The comment provides some support, but it\\'s vague or insufficient. Authors may struggle to follow.\\n\\nScore 3: Somewhat Verifiable. Provides support but missing key elements. Authors must make significant effort.\\n\\nIn this case, the notation issue is a valid point based on common sense (established practice), so that\\'s some support. The mathematical correctness is not supported. Since the review has two parts, one with some support and one without, the overall support is partial but not enough. The notation part is borderline between 2 and 3. Since the main issue (mathematical correctness) is not supported, the overall score would be 2. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the notation part alone is sufficient for score 3, but the other part drags it down. Hmm.\\n\\nLooking at an example: \"The study claims significant advancements... without a detailed comparison...\" was scored 2 because it lacked specific examples.

The claim is that the paper didn\\'t cite relevant state-of-the-art work, which affects the experiment\\'s validity. The reviewer not only states this but also gives a specific example: Baidu\\'s paper, the dataset details, and the comparison result. They even included a URL for reference. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria, a 5 requires the claim to be thoroughly supported with explicit evidence. The reviewer here provides a direct reference, dataset comparison, and numerical results. This makes the claim very clear and backed up. The authors can check the provided link, look up the Baidu work, and see the numbers themselves. The justification is solid because it\\'s pointing to a specific missing comparison that directly impacts the results presented. \\n\\nIs there anything missing? The reviewer didn\\'t explain why exactly the Baidu work is state-of-the-art beyond the numbers, but the numbers and the dataset similarity are enough. The key here is that the evidence is concrete and specific. There\\'s no vagueness here; they named the work, gave the dataset size, and the exact performance metric. This should be enough for the authors to verify and address. \\n\\nSo, this seems like a 5 because it\\'s fully verifiable through the provided details and references. The reviewer didn\\'t just say \"you missed some references\" but gave a concrete example with proof. That fits the 5 criteria perfectly.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Review Point:**  \\n2. In the experiment of face recognition, some state-of-the art references are missing, such as Baidu\\'s work \"Targeting Ultimate Accuracy: Face Recognition via Deep Embedding\", http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html#baidu. In that work, the triplet loss is also used and it reported the result trained on the dataset containing 9K identities and 450K images, which is similar with Webface. The VRF can achieve 98.65% on LFW which is better than the result in Table 3 in this paper.  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer claims that the paper’s face recognition experiments lack critical state-of-the-art references, specifically citing Baidu’s work. The claim is **fully verifiable** because:  \\n1. **Specific Reference Provided:** The reviewer names the missing work (\"Targeting Ultimate Accuracy: Face Recognition via Deep Embedding\"), provides a URL, and explicitly states that it uses triplet loss (the same as the paper).  \\n2. **Dataset and Performance Details:** The reviewer compares the Baidu work’s dataset (9K identities, 450K images) to the paper’s Webface dataset, noting their similarity. They also cite a specific numerical result (98.65% on LFW) that directly contrasts with the paper’s Table 3.  \\n3. **Clear Justification:** The comparison highlights a gap in the paper’s experimental validation, as the cited work achieves better performance on the same benchmark (LFW).  \\n\\nThe explicit details and concrete evidence (e.g., dataset sizes, performance metrics, and a direct link) allow the authors to independently verify the claim.

The reviewer's main point is that the method used by the authors (taking the first subword token) might not be the standard approach. They provide an alternative method (averaging) and reference a specific paper. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria, a score of 5 requires the claim to be thoroughly supported with explicit evidence, like references or clear reasoning. Here, the reviewer does reference a specific work (Hewitt and Manning, 2019) which is a good start. The mention of the footnote adds precision, making it easier for the authors to check the source. \\n\\nThe justification here is logical: the reviewer is suggesting a common alternative practice and provides a citation. The authors can verify the claim by looking at the cited paper's footnote, which likely discusses their approach to subword embeddings. This supports the claim well. \\n\\nHowever, is there anything missing? The reviewer doesn't explain why averaging might be better, just that it's common. But the presence of the reference is sufficient to make the claim verifiable.

The justification is grounded in common practice in the field, as indicated by the cited work, and provides precise evidence for the alternative approach.

The key here is whether the reviewer provides enough justification, logical reasoning, common sense, or references to back up their claim. The claim here is that the experiments are comprehensive and cover specific scenarios like architectural mismatch and cross-domain imitation.\\n\\nLooking at the review point itself, the reviewer states that the authors did comprehensive experiments but doesn\\'t provide any details or examples. They mention two specific settings (architectural mismatch and cross-domain) but don\\'t explain why these experiments are comprehensive. There\\'s no reference to external studies, data, or further reasoning. The statement is a factual claim about what the authors did, but it\\'s presented without supporting evidence beyond the assertion itself. \\n\\nWait, but is the claim a positive one? The reviewer is saying the experiments are comprehensive. However, to verify that, does the reviewer need to back it up? If the reviewer is pointing out that the experiments are comprehensive, maybe they\\'re commending the authors. But the aspect here is about how well the reviewer\\'s claim is supported. \\n\\nThe problem is, the reviewer just states that the experiments are comprehensive but doesn\\'t give any reasoning. For example, they might have said \"they tested on multiple datasets\" or \"they varied parameters extensively,\" but here it\\'s just a statement. So, the claim is about the comprehensiveness, but there\\'s no justification. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scoring criteria: \\n\\nA score of 1 is when there\\'s no support.

The mention of architectural mismatch and cross-domain imitation are specific scenarios, but without explaining why those scenarios make the experiments comprehensive, or perhaps pointing to tables or results that show this. \\n\\nWait, maybe the mention of those two settings is a form of justification? The reviewer is pointing out that the experiments cover those areas, which are important, so the comprehensiveness is demonstrated by including those. But is that enough?\\n\\nHmm. The definition for \"somewhat verifiable\" (score 3) says the comment provides support but key elements are missing. The examples include things like \"the evaluative framework appears limited in scope, with considerations restricted to three tasks...\" which gives some reasoning but lacks specifics. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer does mention two specific experimental settings, which is some support. But does that count as sufficient? The claim is about \"comprehensive experiments,\" so the justification is that they included these two aspects. However, \"comprehensive\" might require more than just mentioning two scenarios. Maybe the reviewer should have explained why those scenarios are critical or referenced other works where such experiments are standard. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer is just stating that the experiments exist and cover those areas, maybe that\\'s enough for a higher score? Wait, but the scoring is about how well the reviewer\\'s claim is supported. The reviewer\\'s own support here is limited to stating the existence of those experiments but not providing evidence from the paper (like citing specific sections or results) or external references. \\n\\nComparing to the example for score 4 (mostly verifiable): \"The two used datasets are very related, where the input sequence is cocktail party speech...\" which provides some reasoning but could be more detailed. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer\\'s support is minimal.

However, without further explanation or references, it\\'s not fully verifiable. \\n\\nThe key is whether the reviewer\\'s own reasoning is sufficient.

Since the reviewer is using the text\\'s own lack of explanation as the justification, that\\'s a form of logical reasoning. So maybe it\\'s a 3?

The reviewer is just asking a question, which is a form of pointing out ambiguity. \\n\\nAlternatively, since the reviewer is asking a question that indicates the explanation is missing, that\\'s a form of logical reasoning (if the term isn\\'t defined, it\\'s unclear). Therefore, the claim is somewhat supported, but the explanation is brief. So maybe 3? \\n\\nWait, the example for score 2 is \"the transfer tasks are too artificial\" with a reason about pretraining examples.

The reviewer is making a claim (the term is unclear) but the justification is just the absence of explanation, which is a valid point but perhaps not fully elaborated. The authors could argue that \"steps\" is a common term, but the reviewer is pointing out that it\\'s not clear here.

The examples for 3 include things like \"the evaluative framework appears somewhat limited...\" which is a similar level of justification. \\n\\nHmm.

The reviewer is asking the authors to explain why their algorithm didn\\'t reach the better rate and to discuss the theoretical differences.\\n\\nFirst, I need to assess the verifiability of this claim. The reviewer is making a specific comparison between the current work and prior methods. They reference specific papers (SUSTAIN[1] and MRBO[2]), which is good because that\\'s an external reference.

The reviewer is using established results (common sense in the field) and references to support their claim. \\n\\nNow, looking at the scoring criteria. A score of 5 requires thorough support with explicit evidence. Here, the references are there, and the numerical rates are given. The reasoning is logical. But maybe there\\'s a minor gap because the reviewer doesn\\'t explain why the difference in rates occurs—they just point it out and ask the authors to explain. However, the core claim (that the rates are as stated) is well-supported by the references. \\n\\nThe claim is that DMLCBO underperforms in convergence rate compared to SUSTAIN and MRBO. The reviewer provides the necessary references and the specific rates, which are verifiable through those sources. Therefore, the support is strong enough for a high score. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scoring criteria, the 5 examples often include references to specific papers and data.

Similarly, here, the references and the numerical rates align with that. \\n\\nThe only possible minor gap is not explaining the theoretical differences themselves, but the reviewer is asking the authors to do that, so the reviewer\\'s own justification for the claim (that the rates are worse) is solid.

Let\\'s break down the claim. The main points here are that the modulator is heuristic and that there might be scalability issues requiring a lot of hyperparameter tuning.\\n\\nLooking at the examples for each score, let\\'s see where this fits. The claim is that the modulator is heuristically designed. The reviewer is pointing out that the design isn\\'t based on a principled method, which could lead to problems scaling up because hyperparameter tuning might become tedious across different datasets. \\n\\nNow, checking the scoring criteria. A score of 1 is when there\\'s no support. The reviewer mentions \"heuristically designed\" but does not provide any specific evidence or references. They also mention scalability issues but don\\'t explain why or how. \\n\\nA score of 2 is borderline. Maybe there\\'s some support but vague.

The term \"heuristically designed\" is a judgment but lacks justification. \\n\\nScore 3 is somewhat verifiable but missing elements.

The justification is there in the sense that heuristic methods can sometimes be problematic, but it\\'s not explicitly tied to this specific case with evidence. \\n\\nScore 4 is mostly verifiable with minor gaps. If there was some reasoning, like referencing common issues with heuristics in scaling, that could push it here. But the reviewer doesn\\'t do that. \\n\\nScore 5 requires solid evidence or references. Since there are none, this isn\\'t the case. \\n\\nThe key here is that the reviewer states the modulator is heuristic but doesn\\'t explain why that\\'s a problem in this context, or reference prior work where such designs had scalability issues. The second part about scalability and hyperparameter tuning is presented as a concern but without any supporting data or examples. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scoring criteria, this seems similar to the examples under 1 or 2.

Here, the reviewer is making two claims: modulator is heuristic, and there\\'s a scalability issue. Both lack support. \\n\\nHmm. The example under 1 includes \"the reasons for this should be investigated\" which is similar to pointing out an issue without explaining why. The reviewer here says \"it\\'s hard to justify\" the scalability issue. The problem is that the reviewer is making a claim without providing any reasoning or references. \\n\\nSo, since there\\'s no supporting evidence, it\\'s a 1.

However, the verifiability is about the reviewer\\'s justification. \\n\\nWait, the aspect is about how well the reviewer justifies their claim. So, the reviewer says the modulator is heuristically designed. To justify that claim, they need to explain why they think that. If they don\\'t, then the claim is unsupported. Similarly, the scalability issue is another claim without support. \\n\\nTherefore, this is a 1 because both claims are made without any supporting evidence or reasoning.

The reviewer needs to provide their reasoning. \\n\\nThe example under 2 includes \"It is unclear whether this momentum term could be a confounding factor...\" which is similar. The reviewer here is also making a claim about a potential issue without concrete evidence, so that\\'s a 2. \\n\\nWait, the example under 2 is \"the momentum term could be a confounding factor\" but the reviewer doesn\\'t explain why. The current review point is similar: \"it\\'s hard to justify if there is a scalability issue...\" which is a similar lack of justification. \\n\\nSo maybe this is a 2. The reviewer is pointing out a possible problem (scalability due to heuristic design) but not providing enough reasoning. \\n\\nThe difference between 1 and 2 is that 1 has no support, 2 has some support but vague.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is saying that the first two sections are hard to read because the author stacked previous approaches without explaining them clearly.

The main claim here is that the sections are hard to read due to unclear explanations. The reviewer provides specific instances where they were confused. Let\\'s look at the examples given. \\n\\nIn the first example, the reviewer points out confusion about the transition from Figure 2(a) to 2(b), specifically about the absence of h_{t-1}^{1..5} in Figure 2(b) and what h_{t-1} refers to. This is a concrete point about the figures and their descriptions. The reviewer is pointing out a lack of clarity in the explanation of the figures, which is a specific issue. \\n\\nThe second example is about a sentence in line 96: \"our lower hierarchical layers zoom in time\" and the following sentence. The reviewer doesn\\'t understand this phrasing, which suggests that the explanation of the model\\'s architecture here is unclear. \\n\\nNow, according to the scoring criteria, verifiability depends on how well the reviewer supports their claim with reasoning, common sense, or references. Here, the reviewer provides specific examples of where the text is unclear. They are pointing out exact parts of the paper (lines and figures) where the explanations are lacking. This makes the claim somewhat supported by specific instances. \\n\\nHowever, the reviewer doesn\\'t provide external references or detailed logical reasoning beyond pointing out the confusion. They just state that the explanations are unclear and give examples. The justification is based on their own confusion, which is a form of common sense (if the reviewer couldn\\'t follow, others might not either). But the support is through pointing out specific points of confusion rather than, say, referencing established standards for clarity in explanations or providing alternative explanations. \\n\\nComparing to the scoring criteria:\\n- A score of 2 (borderline) would be if the support is vague.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is pointing out that the paper doesn\\'t compare their method with existing DAS earthquake detectors, like PhaseNet-Das by Zhu et al. 2023, and there\\'s no justification for why their approach is better. They also mention that if the paper is presenting a foundation model as a proof of concept, it should be clearer and provide justification for future applications.\\n\\nFirst, I need to assess the verifiability of the reviewer\\'s claims. The main claim here is that the paper lacks a comparison with existing methods and justification for their approach\\'s benefits. The reviewer references a specific existing method (PhaseNet-Das) and mentions that there might be others. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria, the reviewer provides a specific example (Zhu et al. 2023) which is a reference to an external work. This supports the claim that comparisons are missing. However, the reviewer doesn\\'t provide detailed reasoning beyond pointing out the absence and suggesting that if it\\'s a foundation model, this should be clearer. \\n\\nThe justification here is that without comparing to existing baselines, it\\'s hard to assess the method\\'s benefits. The mention of PhaseNet-Das gives a concrete example, which adds some support. But the reviewer could have gone further by explaining why the comparison is necessary or how the lack of it affects the paper\\'s contribution. \\n\\nThe claim is somewhat supported by the reference but lacks detailed analysis or further evidence. The authors might need to look into why exactly the comparison is important, but the reviewer\\'s point is grounded in pointing out a specific omission. \\n\\nComparing to the scale: \\n\\n- A score of 4 (Mostly Verifiable) requires sufficient support with minor gaps.

Here, the mention of a specific paper and the implication that the authors didn\\'t justify their method\\'s benefits against existing work is a solid point. \\n\\nWait, the reviewer also suggests that if the paper is a foundation model, it should be clearer and show future applications. This part is a bit more of a suggestion rather than a verified claim. The main issue is the lack of comparison and justification. \\n\\nThe key is that the reviewer provides an example (Zhu et al.) which substantiates the claim that existing methods exist. The lack of comparison is a valid point, and the reference backs that up.

But since they mention the specific reference and the need for justification, it\\'s sufficiently supported. \\n\\nHmm, I think this is a 4: Mostly Verifiable. The claim is well-supported by the reference to Zhu et al., but there\\'s a minor gap in not fully explaining the implications of not having that comparison beyond stating it\\'s missing. The authors can address this by adding the comparison, but the reviewer\\'s point is clear enough with the reference provided.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review point raises a claim that the paper fails to compare its method with existing DAS earthquake detectors (e.g., PhaseNet-Das by Zhu et al. 2023) and lacks justification for its benefits over these methods. The reviewer further suggests that if the paper positions itself as a foundational model, this should be clarified with future applications. The claim is supported by a specific reference to PhaseNet-Das, which substantiates the existence of relevant prior work. However, the justification for why the comparison is critical or how the absence undermines the contribution is implied but not fully elaborated. While the reference to Zhu et al. provides concrete evidence of an existing baseline, the reviewer does not explicitly explain the implications of omitting such comparisons (e.g., how it affects the novelty or validity of the proposed method). This minor gap in reasoning places the claim in the \"Mostly Verifiable\" category.  \\n\\n**Score:** 4  \\n**Reasoning:** The claim is sufficiently supported by the citation of a specific prior work (Zhu et al.) but lacks']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user provided two separate comments here, so I need to evaluate each one based on the verifiability criteria.\\n\\nStarting with the first part: \"Page 2, second paragraph in Related Work, the Walkman algorithm (Mao et al., 2020) is solved by ADMM, with two versions, one is to solve a local optimization problem, the other is to solve a gradient approximation. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that \\'However, these works are all based on the simple SGD for decentralized optimization.\\'\"\\n\\nThe reviewer is pointing out an inaccuracy in the related work section. They mention that the Walkman algorithm uses ADMM, not SGD, and have two versions. The claim here is that the authors\\' statement about \"these works are all based on the simple SGD\" is incorrect because Walkman uses ADMM. The justification comes from referencing Mao et al., 2020 and explaining the two versions of Walkman. This seems solid because they\\'re citing a specific paper and explaining why the original statement is wrong. The key here is the citation of Mao et al. and the explanation of ADMM vs SGD. That should be enough to make it verifiable. The reviewer provides a logical reasoning by pointing out the specific algorithm and its method, so this is probably a 4 or 5. Since they cite a specific work, that\\'s a strong point. \\n\\nNow the second part: \"Section 3, first paragraph, in \\'It can often have faster convergence and better generalization than the SGD-based Algorithm 1, as will be demonstrated empirically in Section 4.1.\\' The \\'it\\' does not have a clear reference.\"\\n\\nHere, the reviewer is noting a grammatical issue where the pronoun \"it\" is unclear. The claim is that the wording is ambiguous. The justification is that the antecedent of \"it\" isn\\'t clear. This is more about clarity rather than a factual claim. Since it\\'s a grammatical ambiguity, the reviewer doesn\\'t need to provide evidence beyond pointing out the unclear reference. The reasoning is straightforward—readers can\\'t tell what \"it\" refers to. However, the claim here is about the clarity of the text, not a factual inaccuracy. Since the reviewer is just pointing out the ambiguity without needing external evidence, this might be a 1 or 2. But since the reasoning is clear (the pronoun is ambiguous), maybe it\\'s borderline. Wait, the scoring criteria for verifiability: if the claim is about the text\\'s clarity, the justification is the ambiguity itself. Since the reviewer clearly states the problem (unclear reference), that\\'s sufficient. But according to the scoring, a 1 is when there\\'s no support. But here, the reviewer\\'s point is self-evident by looking at the sentence. The claim is that \"it\" is unclear, which is verifiable by reading the sentence. So maybe this is a 3? Or perhaps a 2? Hmm.\\n\\nWait, the first part of the review point is about inaccuracy in the related work. The second is about unclear reference. Let me check the scoring again.\\n\\nFor the first part: The reviewer references Mao et al., 2020 and explains that Walkman uses ADMM, not SGD, so the claim that \"these works are all based on SGD\" is wrong. The justification is solid with a specific reference and explanation. This is fully verifiable because the reviewer provides the citation and reasoning. So that should be a 5? Or maybe 4? Because they mention two versions of Walkman but don\\'t cite both? Wait, the reviewer says \"the Walkman algorithm (Mao et al., 2020) is solved by ADMM, with two versions...\" So they are explaining the algorithm\\'s method from the cited paper. Since they reference the paper and explain how it\\'s not SGD, that\\'s sufficient. So that\\'s a 5.\\n\\nThe second part: The unclear \"it\" is a grammatical issue. The reviewer\\'s claim is that the pronoun is ambiguous. The justification is that \"it\" has no clear reference. Since the reviewer is pointing out a sentence structure problem, this is somewhat verifiable. The reasoning is there (the pronoun is unclear), but maybe it\\'s borderline because it\\'s subjective? Wait, but if you look at the sentence, you can see that \"it\" is ambiguous. So the reviewer\\'s point is objectively correct. The claim is that the wording is unclear, which is verifiable by reading the sentence. So that\\'s a 3? Or maybe a 2? Because it\\'s a simple observation without needing external evidence. Since the justification is the sentence itself, maybe it\\'s a ']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is saying that in the experimental section, the authors only compared with two baselines and there are other relevant works like [1,2,3] that should be included. The suggestion is to add more experiments to show the method\\'s effectiveness.\\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate the verifiability of this claim based on the scoring criteria. Let\\'s see. The claim is that the authors didn\\'t include enough baselines. The justification provided is that there are existing works (specifically cited as [1,2,3]) that focus on the same questions. The reviewer is pointing out that these other works should be compared against. \\n\\nLooking at the examples given in the scoring criteria, a score of 5 requires explicit references and solid reasoning. Here, the reviewer does mention specific references [1,2,3], which is good. However, the problem is that the actual titles or more details about these works aren\\'t provided. The mention of \"[1,2,3]\" is a placeholder, so without knowing what those references are, the authors might not have the context to verify if those are indeed relevant. But maybe in the actual paper, those would be real citations. Assuming that in the real context, [1,2,3] are properly cited works, then this would be a strong point. \\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s reasoning is that since those works address the same questions, they should be included as baselines. That\\'s logical. However, the justification is a bit brief. The reviewer doesn\\'t explain why exactly those works are important or how they are similar. They just state that they exist. \\n\\nComparing to the scoring examples: For a 5, the examples given have specific references and clear comparisons. For instance, in the face recognition example, the Baidu work is named with a link and specific results compared. Here, the references are cited but without further details. The reasoning is present but maybe not as thorough. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the references [1,2,3] are well-known in the field and the connection is obvious, then the claim is verifiable. But if those references aren\\'t explained, then maybe it\\'s a 4. The key is whether the reviewer provided enough support. Since they at least mention existing works that are relevant, that\\'s better than a vague suggestion. \\n\\nThe claim is that the authors should include more baselines. The support is the existence of these other works. Without more details, like explaining why those methods are strong baselines or how they compare, it might not be fully verifiable. The reviewer could have provided more explanation, like pointing out specific aspects where those methods are comparable. \\n\\nLooking at the score 4 example: \"The statistical analysis appears incorrect because the p-values reported for the t-tests do not align with standard thresholds for significance.\" That\\'s a clear logical reasoning with specific statistical terms. Here, the reasoning is that existing works exist, so they should be included. It\\'s a logical point but maybe not as detailed. \\n\\nAnother example for 4 mentions that datasets are related, explaining the relationship. The current review point mentions that the other works focus on the same questions but doesn\\'t elaborate. So maybe it\\'s a 4. \\n\\nWait, but the presence of the references [1,2,3] is a form of external verification. Even if the details are in the citations, the reviewer is pointing to existing works. So if the authors can check those references and see that they are indeed relevant, then the claim is supported. The justification is there through the references. \\n\\nIn the 5 example, like the one with Hewitt and Manning, they cite a specific paper and explain how it\\'s done there. Here, the references are cited but without further explanation. However, the mere mention of the references as existing works on the same questions does provide some external validation. \\n\\nHmm. Maybe this is a 4 because while the references are given, the explanation is brief. The reviewer could have explained why those works are important or how they compare, but they didn\\'t. So it\\'s somewhat supported but not fully. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the references are sufficient, maybe it\\'s a 5. But since the reasoning is minimal beyond citing them, perhaps 4 is better. \\n\\nThe scoring criteria for 5 requires \"explicit and sufficient evidence\". The references are explicit, but without more context, maybe it\\'s not sufficient. \\n\\nWait, the examples in 5 include specific references and clear reasoning. For instance, in the face recognition case, the reviewer compared the results of Baidu\\'s work with the current paper\\'s table. Here, the reviewer just says \"there’re several works also focus on the same questions, for example [1,2,3]\". The comparison isn\\'t made explicit beyond existence. \\n\\nTherefore, the claim is supported by references but lacks a detailed comparison or explanation of why those works are relevant baselines. So it\\'s somewhat verifiable but not fully. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria for 4: \"The comment’s claim is sufficiently supported but has minor gaps. The reviewer could provide a more detailed explanation or reference.\" \\n\\nYes, the references are there but the explanation is minimal. So 4 seems appropriate. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the references are enough, maybe 5.

The reviewer is pointing out that the dataset\\'s quality can\\'t be assessed because the methods for translation and filtering aren\\'t clearly described. \\n\\nNow, I need to check the supporting elements.

However, the reasoning is still minimal. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s a 3 (somewhat verifiable) because the reviewer is using logical reasoning (methodology details are needed for assessment), but the support is not fully fleshed out.

The key here is whether the reviewer provides enough reasoning. The claim is that the filtering process details are lacking. The support is the need to assess dataset quality, which is a standard practice. Since the reviewer is relying on common sense about research methodology, that\\'s a valid verification method. But does that make it borderline or somewhat verifiable?\\n\\nLooking at the example for score 3: \"The evaluative framework appears somewhat limited in scope...\" is scored 3 because it\\'s supported but missing specifics. Similarly, this comment is pointing out a limitation in methodology description. The reviewer\\'s reasoning is that without the details, you can\\'t assess quality, which is a logical point. But the support is still minimal. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had cited a standard practice for dataset creation that requires such details, that would be better. Since they didn\\'t, it\\'s relying on common sense but without explicit references. \\n\\nThe borderline (score 2) examples include things like \"the momentum term could be a confounding factor\" without explaining why. Here, the reviewer is saying \"details are lacking\" which is a bit more concrete than that example. \\n\\nWait, the example for score 2 includes \"the transfer tasks are too artificial\" without specifics. The current comment is similar in that it points to a specific aspect (filtering process) needing more info but doesn\\'t explain why that\\'s important beyond saying it\\'s needed to assess quality. \\n\\nTherefore, maybe this is a 2. The reviewer\\'s claim is that details are missing, but the justification is that it\\'s needed to assess quality. That\\'s a logical point, but the support is still vague because it doesn\\'t elaborate on how the lack of details specifically hinders the assessment. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reasoning is considered sufficient because it\\'s common sense that methodology details are needed for assessment, then maybe it\\'s a 3. \\n\\nI think the key difference between 2 and 3 here is whether the reasoning is present.

The example given is \"evaluative framework limited in scope with considerations restricted to three tasks...\" which is somewhat supported but needs more specifics. \\n\\nIn our case, the reviewer is saying that the filtering process details are lacking, which is a specific area, but the justification is that more info is needed to assess quality.

The key is to check how well the reviewer justifies their claim. The comment mentions specific categories of existing methods and references them, which is a good start.

Since they reference Figure 1, which the authors can check, that adds some concreteness. So maybe 3. \\n\\nWait, the examples for 3 include \"The evaluative framework appears somewhat limited...\", which is similar. The current review point is similar in that it\\'s pointing out a limitation based on reasoning but without external references. \\n\\nTherefore, the score should be 3: Somewhat Verifiable. The reviewer provides a logical basis using common knowledge but doesn\\'t provide external references or more detailed explanation, so authors need to make some effort to follow the reasoning.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer questions the validity of the synthetic experiment in a non-separable case by pointing out that neural networks, due to their nonlinear expression capabilities, should theoretically be able to separate the data distribution shown in Figure 1. The claim is supported by logical reasoning rooted in common-sense knowledge about neural networks\\' ability to handle nonlinear data. However, the justification lacks specific references to external studies or detailed explanations (e.g., why Figure 1’s data is truly inseparable despite this capability). While the reasoning is sound, the absence of concrete evidence or examples means the authors may need to infer the reviewer’s perspective, requiring additional effort to address the critique fully.  \\n\\n**Score:** 3 (Somewhat Verifiable)  \\n\\n**Rationale Explanation:**  \\nThe claim is based on logical reasoning about neural networks’ nonlinear capabilities, which is a foundational concept in the field. The reference to Figure 1 provides a concrete element of the paper to anchor the critique. However, the reviewer does not cite specific literature or provide further details (e.g., why the data in Figure 1 is inherently inseparable despite nonlinear models) to fully substantiate the claim. This gap places the justification in the \"somewhat verifiable\" category, as authors must work to reconcile the reviewer’s argument with their experimental setup.']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user provided a bunch of examples and now wants me to evaluate this specific review comment based on the verifiability aspect. \\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the scoring criteria. The key is to assess how well the reviewer supports their claims with justifications, logical reasoning, references, etc. Let\\'s break down the review point.\\n\\nThe review point has two parts. The first part is about a specific sentence in the paper: \"to force the neural network to memorize them\". The reviewer says they would \"tone down this statement\" because, in their understanding, the neural network doesn\\'t memorize an exact \"critical point\" as in TopoNet [24]. The second part is a minor comment about the method section being wordy and mentions grammatical errors, like plurals and articles, with an example (though the example is cut off).\\n\\nStarting with the first part: the claim is that the paper\\'s statement about memorization is overstated. The justification here is the reviewer\\'s understanding that TopoNet [24] doesn\\'t involve memorizing exact critical points. They reference TopoNet, which is an external work, so that\\'s a point in favor of verifiability. The reviewer is using their knowledge of prior work (TopoNet) to argue that the claim in the paper isn\\'t accurate. That\\'s good because it\\'s a reference to an existing work, which supports the claim. However, the reviewer says \"in my understanding\"—this is a bit subjective. They don\\'t elaborate further or provide specific evidence from TopoNet to back this up. So, while there\\'s a reference, the explanation is brief and might not be fully detailed. \\n\\nThe second part is about the method section being wordy and grammatical errors. The reviewer suggests compressing the method section and mentions grammatical issues like plurals and articles. However, they don\\'t provide specific examples beyond a truncated \"E.g. l.\" which is incomplete. Without concrete examples, the authors might not know exactly where the issues are. The mention of grammatical errors is a valid point, but since there\\'s no specific instance, it\\'s hard to verify. The wordiness is somewhat subjective unless there\\'s a standard for conciseness in the field, but the reviewer hasn\\'t cited any. \\n\\nPutting it all together. The first part has a reference to TopoNet, which is a plus, but the reasoning is brief and lacks explicit details from the paper. The second part is vague on specifics. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria:\\n\\nFor the first claim (memorization): The reviewer uses an external reference (TopoNet) but doesn\\'t provide explicit evidence (like a quote or specific section in TopoNet) to show that TopoNet doesn\\'t involve memorizing critical points. It\\'s a reference, but maybe insufficient for full verifiability. So maybe a 3 or 4? \\n\\nThe second part (wordiness and grammar): The grammar part is a 1 because no examples. The wordiness is a subjective claim without specifics, so also low. But since the main claim is the first part, which is about the technical content, the grammar is minor. \\n\\nThe overall score would hinge on the first part. Since there\\'s a reference but not a detailed explanation, maybe a 3 (somewhat verifiable). Alternatively, if the reference is enough, maybe 4. The examples in the 4 score include things like referencing literature (e.g., F and G in an earlier example got a 4). The example given for 4 says \"It forms a mostly verifiable claim with logical reasoning but lacks a detailed analysis...\" So here, the first part has a reference but the reasoning is brief. Maybe 4? Wait, the example for 4 also mentions \"lacks a detailed analysis using these alternatives\" so the claim is mostly there but could be better. Here, the reviewer\\'s claim about TopoNet is a valid point but without more detail. So maybe 4. However, the second part of the review point (grammar and wordiness) is weak, but the primary claim is the first part. Since the question is about the entire review point, but the scoring is per the claims in the review point. The first claim (memorization) is the main technical claim here. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the review point is considered as a whole, the second part drags it down. But the grammar part is a separate minor point. The first part\\'s score would be 3 or 4. \\n\\nLooking at the examples again. The example for score 4 includes \"The two used datasets are very related...\" which is a claim supported by the reviewer\\'s observation about the datasets, but no references. That got a 4. Here, the first part references TopoNet, so maybe that\\'s better. \\n\\nThe example for 5 includes references to specific papers and their contributions. Since the reviewer here only mentions TopoNet but doesn\\'t elaborate, maybe it\\'s a 4. \\n\\nSo, the first part is mostly verifiable (4), the second part is unverifiable (1 and 2), but the overall review point\\'s primary claim is the first part. Since the question says to evaluate the review point as a whole, perhaps the score is 3 or 4. \\n\\nWait, the scoring instructions say to evaluate each review point\\'s verifiability. The first claim (memorization) has a reference but needs more detail. The second part is minor and not well-supported. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the first part\\'s reference to TopoNet [24] is enough to make it 4. The example for 4 includes references to literature (like \"works of A and B\" in one of the earlier examples got a 4). Since the reviewer here cites Topo']\n",
      "[\"Okay, let's tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the verifiability of the given review using the provided scoring criteria. Let me first read through the review point carefully.\\n\\nThe review has two parts: \\n\\n1. The comparison with Megatron is overrated because Megatron and COCO-LM's performance is close to other models like RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and DeBERTa, which have similar sizes. If the paper claims COCO-LM is parameter-efficient, that conclusion applies to those others too.\\n\\n2. A question about switching BPE vocabulary types (uncased to cased) and whether that affects performance variance.\\n\\nStarting with the first part: The reviewer is saying that comparing to Megatron isn't fair because other models perform similarly. They mention specific models (RoBERTa, etc.) and note they have similar sizes. The claim here is that the parameter efficiency of COCO-LM isn't unique since others with similar sizes also do well. \\n\\nThe justification here is that the reviewer lists other models and points out their sizes. However, they don't provide specific performance numbers or references to studies comparing these models. They just state that the performances are close. Without concrete data or references, the support is somewhat there but maybe not fully. The reviewer is using common sense about model sizes and performance, but maybe not enough specifics. \\n\\nNow the second part is a question about BPE vocabulary types. The reviewer is asking why the authors changed from uncased to cased and if that affects performance. The claim here is that this switch might be causing variance. The reviewer's reasoning is that changing BPE type could influence results, which is a logical point. However, again, there's no data provided here, just a question. \\n\\nSo for the first part, the reviewer references other models but doesn't cite specific papers or numbers. They use common sense that similar-sized models would have comparable performance. That's somewhat supporting but not fully. The second part is a question, so it's more of a request for clarification rather than a claim. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria:\\n\\n- For the first part: The reviewer mentions other models and their sizes, which is a form of common sense or established practices (model sizes relate to performance). But without specific data or references, it's not fully verifiable. Maybe a 3 or 4?\\n\\n- The second part is a question, so it's not a claim. The claim here is that the BPE change might affect variance. The reviewer is suggesting that the change could be a confounding factor, similar to an example in the 2-point criteria. Since it's pointing out a potential issue without evidence, maybe it's a 2?\\n\\nBut the overall review point includes both parts. The main claim in the first part is that the comparison is overrated because others are similar. The justification is that similar-sized models have comparable performance, but without specific data, it's somewhat verifiable (score 3). The question part is more of a request for info, so maybe doesn't affect the score much. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer is implying that since other models of similar size perform similarly, then the parameter efficiency isn't unique, that's a logical point. But without explicit data, it's not fully supported. \\n\\nLooking at the examples given in the scoring:\\n\\nA 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) is when there's some support but key elements missing. The reviewer mentions other models and their sizes, which is a start, but lacks specific references or numbers. \\n\\nA 4 (Mostly Verifiable) would need minor gaps. Maybe if they had cited a specific paper showing those models' performance, but they didn't. \\n\\nHmm. The first part's reasoning is based on the size of the models, which is a common factor in comparing models. The reviewer is using that as a basis, which is a form of common sense knowledge. However, without explicit data or references, it's not fully there. \\n\\nSo maybe 3. \\n\\nThe second part's question about BPE is a bit different. The reviewer is pointing out a possible confounding variable. The claim here is that changing BPE might affect performance variance. The justification is that such changes can influence results. This is a logical point but again, without data. The example in the 2-point criteria mentions a momentum term being a confounding factor without explanation, which got a 2. \\n\\nSo combining both parts, the first part is somewhat verifiable (3), the second part is borderline (2). But since the scoring is per review point, maybe the main claim (first part) is the focus. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the first part's reasoning is somewhat supported but missing specifics, it's a 3. \\n\\nI think the score here would be 3 (Somewhat Verifiable) because the reviewer provides some reasoning (model sizes and similar performance\"]\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is saying that the analysis from lines 128 to 149 isn\\'t convincing enough. They mention that the histogram in Fig 3 shows the GS-P-50 model has a smaller class selectivity score, meaning it shares more features compared to ResNet-50, which learns class-specific features. The authors hypothesize that extra context allows the network to reduce dependency, but the reviewer is questioning how this observation shows that GS-P-50 has better representations.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check the verifiability. The reviewer provides some reasoning: they explain the class selectivity scores and how they relate to feature sharing. They also reference two papers, which is good because that\\'s a verification method listed. The references could support their argument about what class selectivity implies for model performance. \\n\\nThe claim here is that the authors\\' hypothesis isn\\'t convincing. The reviewer\\'s reasoning is based on the data from the histogram and the cited works. The key points are: smaller class selectivity means more shared features, and the authors\\' hypothesis about reduced dependency due to context might not directly translate to better representations. \\n\\nBut does the reviewer explain why smaller class selectivity would indicate better representations? They reference the papers, so maybe those works discuss that shared features are better. The references might back up the idea that class selectivity relates to representation quality. However, the reviewer doesn\\'t explicitly connect the dots between the references and the claim. They mention the papers but don\\'t explain how those papers\\' findings support their argument. \\n\\nThe reviewer also points out the contradiction: if GS-P-50 has less class-specific features, why is that better? The authors think it\\'s because of context reducing dependency, but the reviewer is skeptical. The justification is there but maybe a bit vague on how exactly the references tie into the conclusion. \\n\\nThe references are a plus, so that\\'s part of the verification. The logical reasoning is present but could be more detailed. Since there are references and some explanation, but not fully fleshed out, this might be a 4 (Mostly Verifiable). The minor gaps are the lack of explicit explanation linking the references to the claim, and perhaps not providing more evidence from the papers. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the references directly state that lower class selectivity correlates with better representations, then it\\'s solid. But if the reviewer assumes that without explaining, then maybe it\\'s a 3. Hmm. The reviewer\\'s point is that the authors\\' conclusion isn\\'t convincing based on the data and existing literature.

From the histogram as shown in Fig 3, the GS-P-50 model has smaller class selectivity score, which means GS-P-50 shares more features and ResNet-50 learns more class specific features. And authors hypothesize that additional context may allow the network to reduce its dependency. What is the reason such an observation can indicate GS-P-50 learns better representation?

      "[\"Okay, let's tackle this review point. The reviewer is saying the paper lacks novelty because it's just applying existing work (DeCorr) to a new domain (graph collaborative filtering). They mention that the main contribution is moving DeCorr's ideas into this new area with different datasets and backbones. There are some modifications like different penalty coefficients for users and items, but the reviewer feels there's not enough insight into the unique challenges of overcorrelation in recommender systems.\\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate the verifiability of this claim. The reviewer references DeCorr [1], which is a specific existing work, so that's a good start. They point out that the paper's contribution is transposing DeCorr to a new domain, which is a clear claim. They also mention specific modifications, like penalty coefficients, but argue that the paper doesn't address unique challenges in the new domain.\\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria, the key is whether the claim is supported with logical reasoning, common sense in the field, or references. The reviewer does reference DeCorr, which is a plus. They also explain that the contribution is mainly applying existing methods to a new area, which is a common critique. However, they mention the lack of insights into unique challenges in recommender systems. Is that supported? The reviewer states this as a fact but doesn't provide specific examples or references to what those challenges should be or how other works have addressed them. \\n\\nThe justification here is that the paper's modifications are minor and don't delve into the specific issues of overcorrelation in their domain. The reviewer's reasoning is logical but might be missing concrete evidence. For instance, if they had cited another paper that discusses these challenges, that would make it more verifiable. Since they don't, the support is somewhat there but not fully fleshed out. \\n\\nComparing to the scale: \\n\\n- It's not a 1 because they do reference DeCorr and explain the application. \\n- A 2 might be if the reasoning was too vague, but here the critique is more structured. \\n- A 3 would be if key elements are missing. The reviewer points out the modifications but says they're insufficient. However, without specifics on what's missing, maybe it's a 3. \\n- A 4 would require minor gaps. The main gap is not providing examples of the unique challenges or how others have handled them. \\n\\nHmm. The claim is that the paper lacks insights into unique challenges.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is pointing out some issues in Section 4.2 of the paper.

The equation doesn\\'t include the question representation term r^q, which is mentioned in the text. The second part questions the meaning of σ in the equation and suggests that using two sigmoids might be numerically unstable.\\n\\nStarting with the first claim: the reviewer says the description doesn\\'t match the equation. They provided specific details—the absence of r^q in the equation. That\\'s a concrete point. The justification here is based on pointing out an inconsistency in the paper\\'s own content. Since the reviewer is referencing the section and equation directly, this part is well-supported. The authors can check their own equations and text to see the mismatch, so this is verifiable.\\n\\nNext, the σ question. The reviewer asks if σ is the sigmoid function and then explains that multiplying two sigmoids could be problematic. The reasoning here is logical because multiplying two sigmoid outputs (which are between 0 and 1) might lead to very small numbers, causing numerical instability. The reviewer uses common knowledge about activation functions and numerical issues in neural networks. They don\\'t cite a paper, but the reasoning is based on standard practices. This part is somewhat verifiable because the logic is sound, even without external references.\\n\\nHowever, the reviewer doesn\\'t provide an example or a citation for the numerical instability claim. They just state it as a possibility. So while the first part (missing term) is clearly supported, the second part (σ and instability) is a bit more of a leap without explicit evidence. But since it\\'s a common concern in model design, it\\'s still somewhat justified through common sense in the field.\\n\\nPutting it all together: The first part is solid because it\\'s pointing out an internal inconsistency. The second part has logical reasoning but lacks specific references. The reviewer\\'s claims are supported by pointing out specific elements in the paper and using logical deductions. The main issue is that the second part\\'s numerical instability argument isn\\'t backed by an external source or a detailed example. \\n\\nSo, the first part is definitely verifiable (maybe a 4 or 5), but the second part might bring it down to a 4. The overall score would be 4 because the majority of the claims are well-supported with specific references to the paper\\'s content and logical reasoning, even if one part is missing an external citation. The authors can verify the equation vs. text discrepancy and assess the σ issue based on the reasoning provided.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review point raises two specific concerns:  \\n1. **Discrepancy between description and equation:** The reviewer points out that the equation in Sec. 4.2 lacks a term for the question representation (\\\\(r^q\\\\)), which is mentioned in the text. This is a concrete claim supported by direct references to the paper’s content, making it easily verifiable.  \\n2. **Ambiguity and potential numerical instability:** The reviewer questions the meaning of \\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\) (suggesting it might be a sigmoid function) and argues that multiplying two sigmoid activations could lead to numerical instability.

Overall, the claims are sufficiently justified for authors to address, though minor gaps exist in the numerical instability argument.  \\n\\n**Score:** 4 (Mostly Verifiable)  \\n**Reasoning:** The reviewer provides clear, specific references to the paper’s content (Sec. 4.2, equation terms) and logical reasoning about activation functions.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is saying that the paper\\'s methodology isn\\'t very novel because the ENCODE part was already in [10], and the main new thing is decomposing M_v into D and Phi_v.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check how well the reviewer supports this claim. The key here is whether they provide enough justification. They mention that ENCODE is from [10], which is a reference. That\\'s good because it\\'s citing prior work. Then, they explain the incremental contribution as factorizing M_v into D and Phi_v. That\\'s a specific technical detail about what\\'s new here. \\n\\nNow, does this meet the criteria for verifiability? The claim is that the novelty is limited. The reviewer backs this with a specific reference ([10]) and explains the decomposition part. But do they provide more than just stating the components? They mention the decomposition, but maybe they don\\'t explain why that decomposition isn\\'t a significant contribution. For example, maybe the factorization is a standard technique, but the reviewer doesn\\'t say that. They just state the components. \\n\\nWait, the scoring criteria for 3 (somewhat verifiable) requires that the support is there but some key elements are missing. Here, the reviewer gives a reference and explains the decomposition, but maybe lacks further justification on why the decomposition isn\\'t novel. Like, if they said that the factorization method is commonly used, that would add more support. However, as it stands, they provided a reference for the ENCODE part and explained the decomposition, which gives some basis. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe this is a 2 (borderline) because they mention the reference but don\\'t elaborate on why the decomposition is not novel. The reviewer says the incremental contribution is just the decomposition, but without explaining why that\\'s not a meaningful step. \\n\\nHmm, but the mention of [10] does support the claim that ENCODE isn\\'t new.

The reviewer could have explained why the decomposition isn\\'t novel, like citing another paper that does similar factorization, but they only cite [10] for ENCODE. \\n\\nWait, the claim is about the overall methodology\\'s novelty. The reviewer says the ENCODE part is from [10], and the new part is the decomposition. The implication is that the decomposition isn\\'t enough for novelty.

The claim here is that the formatting issues are severe enough to warrant rejection. The reviewer provides specific examples: cramped equations, close captions, and violating the page limit. These are concrete observations. But do they back it up enough?\\n\\nThe reviewer mentions the page limit violation. If the paper is over the limit, that\\'s a clear, verifiable fact.

But the leap to \"grounds for rejection\" might be a bit of a jump without more explicit evidence. The reviewer could have mentioned the exact page count. \\n\\nSo, considering the criteria, the claim is supported by specific observations (equations, captions) which are verifiable, but the conclusion about rejection severity might be a bit of a stretch without more. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring: \\n\\n- The examples are specific (crammed equations, close captions) which is better than vague. \\n\\n- The reviewer uses common sense about formatting standards and page limits. \\n\\nBut the jump to \"grounds for rejection\" might be a claim that\\'s not fully supported by just the examples given.

The reviewer supports this with specific examples (AU6 in different emotions, Figure 1\\'s data) and suggests cross-dataset testing. \\n\\nLooking at the examples: AU6 in pain vs. happiness across SEMAINE and UNBC datasets. They also reference Figure 1 in the paper, which presumably shows differing co-occurrences. That\\'s concrete evidence. The suggestion for cross-dataset experiments is a logical solution based on the variability they\\'ve pointed out. \\n\\nThe justification includes specific AUs, datasets, and a figure from the paper. This makes the reasoning clear and grounded in the paper\\'s own data and external knowledge (knowing SEMAINE and UNBC are different datasets). The reviewer isn\\'t just making a vague statement; they\\'re pointing to existing data in the paper (Figure 1) and real-world datasets to back up their claim. \\n\\nSo, the claim is supported by logical reasoning (variability implies need for cross-dataset tests), common sense in the field (knowing datasets differ), and specific references (Figure 1, named datasets). There\\'s enough detail here for authors to understand the concern and address it. The only possible missing element is an external reference to a paper that did such cross-dataset tests, but the examples and figure reference are sufficient. \\n\\nComparing to the scoring criteria, this seems to hit the \"Fully Verifiable\" (5) because the reasoning is solid, uses the paper\\'s own data, and logical arguments. The examples and figure make it explicit. The reviewer didn\\'t just say \"this might be a problem\" but showed where in the paper it\\'s visible and why, referencing real datasets. So I think this is a 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Review Point:**  \\n1. One major risk of methods that exploit relationships between action units is that the relationships can be very different across datasets (e.g., AU6 can occur both in an expression of pain and in happiness, and this co-occurrence will be very different in a positive salience dataset such as SEMAINE compared to something like UNBC pain dataset). This difference in correlation can already be seen in Figure 1 with quite different co-occurrences of AU1 and AU12. A good way to test the generalization of such work is by performing cross-dataset experiments, which this paper is lacking.  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer’s claim about the variability of action unit (AU) relationships across datasets is supported by specific examples (e.g., AU6 in pain vs. happiness across SEMAINE and UNBC datasets) and references Figure 1 in the paper to illustrate differing co-occurrences of AU1 and AU12. The argument logically connects this variability to the need for cross-dataset experiments to test generalization, which the paper lacks. The justification is grounded in both the paper’s internal data (Figure 1) and external knowledge of dataset differences (SEMAINE vs. UNBC). This provides clear, explicit reasoning and concrete evidence to substantiate the claim, meeting the criteria for **Fully Verifiable (5)**.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5']\n",

The main claim is that using better meta-data embeddings (as per Reed et al.) could improve performance. The reviewer supports this by citing a specific reference (Reed et al., CVPR 2016, Table 1), which provides evidence that such embeddings exist and are better. This reference is a solid external source, so that\\'s a point in favor of higher verifiability.\\n\\nAdditionally, the reviewer mentions that using attributes is good for fair comparison, implying that the current setup is standard but maybe not optimal. The suggestion to try better embeddings is backed by the cited work, so there\\'s logical reasoning here. The reviewer isn\\'t just making a vague suggestion but is pointing to a specific study that demonstrates alternative, potentially superior embeddings.\\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria, a 5 requires the claim to be thoroughly supported with explicit, sufficient evidence. The citation here is specific and relevant. The reviewer isn\\'t just saying \"there might be better options,\" but is pointing to a particular paper and table that show those options.

For instance, in the 5 examples, they mention references like [9,19] or specific papers. Here, the reference is given with the exact table, which is even more precise. The reviewer\\'s claim is that better options exist, and they point to a source that demonstrates this. The authors can check Reed et al.\\'s Table 1 to see the better embeddings.

This is good for fair comparison. However, from the perspective of getting better performance, better meta-data embeddings options are available. Refer to table 1 in “Learning Deep Representations of Fine-Grained Visual Descriptions, Reed et al, CVPR 2016”. It would be interesting to know the performance of the proposed method when it is equipped with better meta-data embeddings.  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer claims that while using attributes for meta-data ensures fair comparisons, better meta-data embeddings exist (referenced to Table 1 in Reed et al., 2016). This claim is **fully verifiable** because the reviewer explicitly cites a specific external source (Reed et al., 2016) and points to Table 1 to substantiate the existence of superior embeddings. The justification is clear and precise, as the reference provides concrete evidence of alternative embeddings that could improve performance.

The reviewer says it\\'s incremental but doesn\\'t provide specific examples or references to prior work where PCA was used similarly. Without pointing to existing studies that already applied PCA in the same way, it\\'s hard to verify the novelty assessment.

The reviewer doesn\\'t provide specific metrics or experiments where the results lack significance.

That\\'s a logical reasoning point, which supports the claim that it\\'s intuitive. \\n\\nThe fourth point questions whether the assumptions for PCA are met. The reviewer is pointing out that PCA has assumptions (like linearity, data being Gaussian, etc.), and the paper might not have validated these. This is a valid concern, but the reviewer doesn\\'t provide specific evidence from the paper where these assumptions are tested. They just raise the question, so it\\'s more of a prompt for the authors to address rather than a verified issue.\\n\\nThe citation [1] is provided, but it\\'s not clear how it directly supports the claims here. If the cited paper discusses PCA\\'s limitations or assumptions in similar contexts, that would help, but without more context, the reference alone isn\\'t sufficient. \\n\\nPutting this together, the reviewer\\'s claims about novelty and significance are somewhat supported by logical reasoning (PCA\\'s properties make it intuitive) but lack specific examples or references to prior work showing that this application isn\\'t novel.

The key here is whether the reviewer\\'s claim is supported with enough justification. The comment is pointing out an inconsistency in the presentation of equations. The reviewer mentions that ε isn\\'t used in equation (10) but is in (11), so moving the explanation to when (11) is introduced would help. \\n\\nThe justification here is based on the structure of the equations and their presentation.

That would make it a 5? Wait, the examples for 5 include things like referencing external works or explicit reasoning. Here, the reasoning is logical and specific. \\n\\nLooking at the example given for a 5: \"The two used datasets are very related...\" the justification is pointing out the relation between datasets.

The reviewer is using the paper\\'s own equations to point out the inconsistency, so that\\'s sufficient. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5 because the justification is based on explicit elements within the paper (specific equations and parameters), logical reasoning about the flow, and common sense in academic writing.

      "[\"Okay, let's tackle this review point. The reviewer is commenting on a paper where the student model distills knowledge to the teacher, improving the teacher's performance. The reviewer's main claim is that the improvements might be due to regularization effects instead of distillation because the fine-tuning was done for only 10 epochs without early stopping. They also mention that fine-tuning on GLUE without early stopping has high variance and suggest ablation studies are needed.\\n\\nFirst, I need to assess the verifiability of this claim. The reviewer is making a specific argument here. Let's break it down. The claim is that the observed improvements might not be from distillation but from regularization. The justification given is the short training duration (10 epochs) and lack of early stopping, which can lead to high variance. They also reference GLUE's behavior without early stopping and recommend ablation studies.\\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria, I need to see how well the reviewer supports their claim. The reviewer provides a logical reasoning: short training without early stopping can cause variance, so the improvement might be due to regularization. They also mention that this is a known issue in GLUE fine-tuning. However, are there specific references or examples provided? The mention of GLUE's variance is a common-sense knowledge point in the field, so that's a plus. The suggestion for ablation studies is a way to verify, but the reviewer isn't providing existing studies or data to back up their claim further. \\n\\nIs the reasoning clear? Yes, the reviewer explains that the setup (10 epochs, no early stopping) could lead to variance, making the cause of improvement unclear. The reviewer is pointing out a potential confounding variable (training setup) that might explain the results differently than what the paper claims. \\n\\nThe reviewer doesn't cite a specific paper about GLUE's variance without early stopping, but if that's a well-known issue in the community, then common sense in the field supports it. The recommendation for ablation studies is a valid suggestion but doesn't itself verify the claim—it's more of a proposed solution. \\n\\nSo, the justification is there through logical reasoning and field-specific common knowledge. However, the reviewer doesn't provide explicit references or data from their own experience. The claim is supported but not fully with external references. \\n\\nComparing to the scoring scale: \\n\\n- A 4 (Mostly Verifiable) requires sufficient support with minor gaps. The reviewer's reasoning is solid but could be stronger with a citation about GLUE's variance. Since they mention it as a known issue, maybe that's enough for common sense. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the lack of a specific citation is a gap, maybe it's a 3 (Somewhat Verifiable). The key points are explained, but missing explicit references or examples. The reviewer does give specific details about the setup (10 epochs, no early stopping) which adds to the verifiability. \\n\\nHmm. The reviewer's argument is logical and uses domain knowledge (GLUE's variance without early stopping). The suggestion for ablation studies is part of the reasoning. Since they provided specific elements of the methodology (epochs, early stopping) and linked them to potential issues, this seems to be a solid justification. \\n\\nI think this is a 4. The claim is well-supported by logical reasoning and field knowledge, but lacks an explicit reference to back up the GLUE variance point. However, if that's common knowledge, then maybe it's sufficient. The minor gap is the missing citation, so 4 makes sense.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Review\"]\n",

The reviewer makes a claim about negative transfer and contrasts it with the paper\\'s claim. They provide an example from QM9 results, specifically mentioning Transformer-M\\'s performance. The example is concrete, pointing to specific tasks where the model underperforms. \\n\\nThe justification here is that since the model is trained on homo-lumo gap, it doesn\\'t generalize well to other tasks, hence contradicting the \"general-purpose\" description. The reviewer uses the experimental results (Transformer-M\\'s poor performance on most tasks) as evidence. That\\'s a logical reasoning step. \\n\\nAre there references or external sources? The example is from the paper\\'s own experiments (QM9 downstream tasks), so they\\'re using the paper\\'s data. That\\'s valid because it\\'s internal evidence.

To check verifiability, I need to see if there\\'s support for this claim. The reviewer is referencing the paper\\'s own claim and pointing out a missing ablation. Since the paper\\'s own text supports the existence of the claim and the reviewer is highlighting an omission in the experiments, this part has some justification. But does the reviewer provide any reasoning beyond pointing out the absence? Maybe the expectation is that key components should be ablated, which is a common standard in experiments. So that\\'s common sense in the field, which counts as verification.\\n\\nSecond part: \"2.2.1. The continual learning literature has extensive experiments on this dataset and the paper only compares to one approach (DEN).\" Here, the reviewer states that the dataset (CIFAR) has been widely used in continual learning, yet the paper only compares to DEN. The justification here is the existence of extensive literature, implying that comparing to more methods is necessary. The reviewer is using common knowledge about the field\\'s standards for thorough comparisons, which is a valid verification method. However, they don\\'t cite specific papers, so maybe that\\'s a gap.\\n\\nThird part: \"2.2.2. It is unclear if DEN is correctly used/evaluated. It would have been more convincing if the authors used the same setup as in the DEN paper to make sure the comparison is fair/correct.\" The reviewer questions the correct implementation or evaluation of DEN, suggesting using the original setup for fairness. This is a specific suggestion based on best practices in experimental validation. The reasoning here is that following the original setup ensures a fair comparison, which is a logical argument.

The key question posed is how much information of a DAG is encoded in its ancestral graph.\\n\\nFirst, I need to assess the verifiability of the claims here. The reviewer states that the method reduces computation time but sacrifices information by using ancestral graphs instead of full DAGs. The support for this claim is the explanation that the search space reduction leads to less information. \\n\\nThe reviewer provides a logical reasoning here: reducing the search space (to ancestral graphs) inherently limits the possible outputs, so the results can\\'t capture the full information of the richer search space (DAGs). This seems like a reasonable argument, but is there enough to back it up?\\n\\nThey also ask a question about the amount of information retained, which is a valid point for the authors to address. The justification here is based on the premise that ancestral graphs are a subset or simplification of DAGs, so by definition, they might miss some details. The reviewer is pointing out a trade-off between computation and information, which is a common consideration in algorithm design. \\n\\nHowever, the reviewer doesn\\'t provide specific examples, data, or references to back up the claim about the information loss.

How much information of a DAG is encoded in its corresponding ancestral graph?  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment claims that the proposed method sacrifices information by restricting the search space to ancestral graphs instead of full DAGs. This is supported by logical reasoning: reducing the search space inherently limits the output’s information compared to a richer search space (DAGs). The reviewer highlights a trade-off between computational efficiency and information retention. However, the justification lacks specific evidence (e.g., data quantifying information loss, references to studies on ancestral graph limitations, or examples of critical information omitted). While the reasoning is logical, the claim’s verifiability is limited by the absence of concrete examples or references to substantiate the extent of the information loss. The final question (\"How much information...\") further underscores the need for empirical or theoretical grounding to fully validate the concern.  \\n\\n**Score:** 3  \\n**Reasoning:** The claim is supported by logical reasoning about search space reduction but lacks specific examples, data, or references to fully substantiate the extent of information loss.

Or maybe a 4 because the reviewer isn\\'t providing their own data or more specifics about how exactly the case study would show effectiveness, just pointing to another paper\\'s approach. \\n\\nHmm. The scoring for 5 requires \"explicit and sufficient robust evidence\". The example of another paper\\'s case study is a reference, but does that fully support the claim? The reviewer is arguing that without such a case study in this paper, the effectiveness isn\\'t convincing. The reference shows that case studies can be done (as in the other paper), so it\\'s a valid suggestion. \\n\\nAlternatively, the justification is that case studies are needed, and the reviewer provides an example of where it was done, which supports the need. So the reasoning is there, and the external reference backs it up. That seems to fit a 5. But maybe the reviewer didn\\'t explicitly show how the case study would address the specific claim about abandoning complex structures. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s a 4 because while the reference is there, the reviewer doesn\\'t provide more detailed analysis or how exactly the case study would demonstrate the effectiveness. The reviewer\\'s own reasoning is sufficient, but perhaps not fully detailed. \\n\\nWait, the scoring for 4 says \"minor gaps\". The key is whether the claim is \"sufficiently supported but has minor gaps\". Since the reviewer provides a logical argument and a reference, but maybe the connection between the reference and the current paper\\'s case study need is a bit indirect. \\n\\nAlternatively, the presence of the reference is enough for a 5. The example is specific, and the reasoning is clear. The claim is that the paper\\'s argument is unconvincing without a case study, and the reviewer supports this by pointing to another work where such a study was done. \\n\\nI think this is a 5. The justification is solid with an external reference and logical reasoning. The reviewer isn\\'t just saying \"add a case study\", but is giving an example of where it was done effectively, which supports their claim. Therefore, the verifiability is high.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Review Point:**  \\n3.

      "['Okay, I need to evaluate the verifiability of this review point: \"7) in the same section, the notation {\\\\cal P} with a subscript is used several times without being defined.\" Let me start by recalling the scoring criteria.\\n\\nFirst, the aspect here is verifiability_verification. The key is to assess how well the reviewer justifies their claim. The claim here is that the notation {\\\\cal P} with a subscript is used without definition. \\n\\nLooking at the examples given in the scoring criteria, a score of 1 is when there\\'s no support. For instance, if the reviewer just states something without any reasoning or references. A score of 2 is borderline, maybe some vague support. A 3 is somewhat verifiable but missing some elements. 4 is mostly there with minor gaps, and 5 is fully supported with clear evidence.\\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer points out that a specific notation ({\\\\cal P} with subscript) is used without being defined. The justification here is straightforward: the notation isn\\'t defined where it\\'s used. The reviewer is pointing out a lack of definition in the text. \\n\\nIs there any supporting evidence here? The reviewer is referencing the section where this occurs, implying they checked the section and found the undefined notation. The claim is based on the observation that in the section, the notation isn\\'t defined. That\\'s a direct, factual observation about the manuscript. \\n\\nThe reviewer doesn\\'t need external references or complex reasoning here. The verification comes from the presence (or absence) of the definition in the text. Since the reviewer is stating that the notation is used without definition, their claim is based on their reading of the manuscript. \\n\\nThis is similar to the example in score 1 where a comment like \"the results fall behind previous work\" gets a 1 because there\\'s no support. But here, the reviewer is pointing out an omission in the manuscript\\'s notation. Since the reviewer is directly observing a missing definition in the text, this is a factual claim. \\n\\nWait, but according to the scoring criteria, a 1 is when there\\'s no support. But here, the support is the observation that the notation is undefined. The reviewer is providing the evidence by pointing out the specific notation and its usage. So maybe this is more like a 3 or 2?\\n\\nWait, let me think again. The scoring for 1 is when there\\'s no supporting evidence. The example given for 1 includes things like \"the results fall behind previous work\" without any justification. Here, the reviewer is making a claim that the notation isn\\'t defined. The support is the fact that in the manuscript\\'s section, they checked and found it undefined. Since the reviewer is the one making that observation, but they don\\'t provide a quote or a line number, but they do specify the section. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe this is a 3? Because the reviewer is providing some support (they noticed it\\'s undefined in the section), but perhaps the justification is minimal. However, in academic writing, undefined notation is a common issue, so pointing out that a symbol isn\\'t defined is a valid and verifiable claim without needing external references. The verification here is based on the manuscript\\'s content. \\n\\nSo, the reviewer\\'s claim is that the notation is used without definition. To verify, one can check the section mentioned. Since the reviewer has done that and found it undefined, their claim is based on direct observation. This would be similar to the example in score 3, which says \"the evaluative framework appears limited in scope\" with some support but missing specifics. Wait, no. The example for 3 is about scope being limited with three tasks, which is somewhat supported but needs more details. \\n\\nAlternatively, the example for 2 is like \"the momentum term could be a confounding factor\" without more explanation. Here, the notation issue is a straightforward factual error. Since the reviewer is stating a direct issue with the manuscript\\'s writing, the claim is verifiable through checking the manuscript. The support is the reviewer\\'s observation. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 3? Or maybe a 4? Let me check the scoring again. \\n\\nLooking at the 3 examples: \"the evaluative framework appears somewhat limited in scope...\" which is somewhat supported but needs more. The claim here about undefined notation is more concrete. The reviewer is pointing out a specific instance where a symbol isn\\'t defined. The justification is the presence of the undefined symbol in the text. Since that\\'s a direct observation, it\\'s more like a 4? Because it\\'s sufficiently supported but maybe minor gaps. Wait, no. \\n\\nWait, the examples for 4 include \"the statistical analysis appears incorrect because the p-values do not align with standard thresholds\". That\\'s a claim with some reasoning (p-values not aligning with standards). Here, the claim is about undefined notation, which is a clear issue. Since the reviewer is pointing out that in the section, the notation isn\\'t defined, the support is there. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe this is a 5? But 5 requires references or clear reasoning. Here, there\\'s no external references, but the reasoning is that the notation is undefined, which is a common standard in writing. So using undefined notation is against common sense in academic writing. The verification here is based on common sense (notation should be defined before use). \\n\\nAh, right! The verification methods include common sense in the field. Since it\\'s standard in academic papers to define all notations before use, the reviewer is pointing out a violation of that standard. Therefore, the claim is supported by common sense knowledge in the field. That would make this a 5? \\n\\nWait, let me check the scoring again. \\n\\nFor 5: \"Fully Verifiable\" includes logical and unassailable common-sense arguments. So if the reviewer\\'s claim is based on common sense (notation must be defined), then that\\'s a 5. \\n\\nAlternatively, the example given for 5 includes a reference to external works. But here, the reviewer is using common sense. For instance, the example in 5 says \"the paper’s main idea is not novel because several papers [X,Y] have done this\". Here, the reviewer is using the common sense that undefined notations']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user provided several examples of how to score different review comments based on the verifiability aspect. Now, I need to apply that framework to the new review point they\\'ve given. \\n\\nThe review point here is: \"- l148: known, instead of know - l156: please define γ₀*** - Figure 1: Please specify the meaning of the colors in the caption as well as the text.\"\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll break down each part of the review point. The first two items are grammar or typo corrections: \"known\" vs. \"know\" at line 148, and a request to define γ₀*** at line 156. The third part is about clarifying the figure\\'s colors in both the caption and text.\\n\\nLooking at the verifiability criteria, I need to assess how well the reviewer supports their claims. The scoring is from 1 (unverifiable) to 5 (fully verifiable). \\n\\nStarting with the first comment: \"l148: known, instead of know.\" This is pointing out a grammatical error. The reviewer is saying that \"known\" is the correct form instead of \"know.\" Since grammar rules are common knowledge, this doesn\\'t need external references. The justification is based on standard English grammar, so it\\'s common sense in the field. That should be verifiable. \\n\\nSecond part: \"l156: please define γ₀***.\" The reviewer is asking for a definition of a symbol (γ₀ with some subscript). The claim here is that the symbol isn\\'t defined, which the authors should address. The justification is that undefined symbols can confuse readers, which is a standard practice in academic writing. Again, this is common sense, so no external references needed. \\n\\nThird comment: \"Figure 1: Please specify the meaning of the colors in the caption as well as the text.\" The claim is that the figure\\'s colors aren\\'t explained, making it hard to interpret. The reasoning is based on standard figure caption guidelines, which require clarity. This is also common sense in presenting figures, so the reviewer\\'s point is supported by established practices without needing references.\\n\\nNow, checking the scoring criteria. For each part, the reviewer\\'s claims are supported by common sense or established standards (like grammar rules, symbol definitions, and figure caption guidelines). There\\'s no need for external references because these are well-known in academic writing. \\n\\nThe comments don\\'t have any gaps because they directly point out specific issues (typos, undefined terms, unclear figure elements) that are straightforward. The authors can easily verify these points by checking the line numbers and figure captions. \\n\\nLooking at the examples given in the scoring criteria, a score of 5 requires thorough support through clear reasoning or references. Since these points rely on common sense and established practices, they fit into the \"Fully Verifiable\" category (score 5). Even though there are no external references, the justifications are solid because they align with standard academic conventions. \\n\\nWait, but let me double-check. The examples for score 5 include references to external works or data. However, in this case, the reviewer isn\\'t citing any papers but is using common standards. The definition for 5 mentions \"logical and unassailable common-sense arguments.\" Since the reviewer\\'s points are based on standard practices (define symbols, correct grammar, clear figures), that\\'s exactly what the 5 criteria mention. \\n\\nTherefore, each part of the review point is justified through common sense and established norms, so the score should be 5. The authors can easily verify these points by checking their text and figures against standard guidelines.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Review Point:**  \\n- l148: known, instead of know  \\n- l156: please define γ₀***  \\n- Figure 1: Please specify the meaning of the colors in the caption as well as the text.  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review comments address specific issues related to grammar, notation clarity, and figure labeling. Each claim is grounded in **common sense standards for academic writing and presentation**:  \\n1. **Grammar correction (l148):** The claim that \"known\" is preferable to \"know\" is justified by standard English grammar rules, which are universally recognized.  \\n2. **Symbol definition (l156):** The request to define γ₀*** aligns with the expectation that symbols must be explicitly introduced in technical writing to ensure reader comprehension.  \\n3. **Figure clarity:** The directive to']\n",

The reviewer is making a claim that the authors\\' statement is incorrect. To verify this, they reference a specific section in a cited work (Wang et al., 2023). That\\'s a good start because they\\'re pointing to an external source. \\n\\nThe key here is whether the reference provides sufficient support.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the verifiability of the given review comments based on the provided criteria. The aspect here is about how well the reviewer\\'s claims are supported with evidence or reasoning. \\n\\nFirst, I need to parse the review point carefully. The reviewer has two main comments here. The first one is about line 15 being too vague, stating that certain RNNs work well for specific natural language reasoning tasks, and they reference the SNLI leaderboard. The second comment is about lines 16-18 where the reinforcement learning/agent analogy is considered out-of-place, suggesting that the examples later in the paper (lines 229-253) better illustrate generalization capabilities.\\n\\nStarting with the first part (L15): The reviewer claims that the text is too vague and cites the SNLI leaderboard as an example. The reference to the leaderboard is a specific external resource, which is a good sign for verifiability. The mention of literature on natural language inference also supports this. The reviewer is pointing to existing work and data to back up their point about the vagueness. So this part has some solid evidence.\\n\\nNow the second part (L16-18): The reviewer says the RL/agent analogy is out-of-place and suggests the later examples are better. The justification here is that the examples from lines 229-253 better illustrate generalization. The reviewer is referencing specific parts of the paper itself as evidence. This is a logical reasoning point, using parts of the paper to argue that another part is less effective. \\n\\nLooking at the scoring criteria: For a 5 (Fully Verifiable), the claim needs explicit, sufficient evidence like references or clear reasoning. The first part has a specific reference (SNLI leaderboard) which is a concrete example. The second part uses internal references (lines 229-253) to justify the analogy being out-of-place, which is logical but maybe a bit more subjective. However, since the reviewer points to specific parts of the paper that better illustrate the point, it\\'s a solid reasoning. \\n\\nIs there anything missing? The first part could have mentioned specific papers from the NLI literature, but the leaderboard is a valid source. The second part\\'s reasoning is based on the paper\\'s own content, so that\\'s acceptable. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scoring criteria: The first example for a 5 includes referencing specific works and explaining how they relate. The second example here uses internal references, which is similar to the \"logical reasoning\" part of the verification methods. \\n\\nSo, both parts of the review point have supporting evidence. The first part uses an external reference (leaderboard) and the second uses internal examples. This seems to meet the criteria for a 5. However, maybe the second part is a bit more subjective but still logically sound. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reasoning for the RL analogy being out-of-place is just an opinion without deeper analysis, maybe it\\'s a 4.

(2020), but then argue that these baselines are weak. They provide specific numbers from Voita et al. (2019) and compare them to the current work\\'s results, pointing out a large gap in linguistic evaluations.\\n\\nNow, applying the criteria: a claim is something that\\'s subjective, a suggestion, a judgment, or requires evidence. The first part says the paper compares with weak baselines. That\\'s a judgment because the reviewer is assessing the quality of the chosen baselines.

However, the key here is whether the statement itself is a claim needing verification. \\n\\nThe reviewer is making a claim that the baselines are weak by comparing to Voita\\'s results. The mention of Voita\\'s numbers is factual (if they\\'re correct), but the assertion that the baselines are weak because of the gap is a judgment. The reviewer is implying the paper\\'s approach isn\\'t as strong as it could be because it\\'s only beating weaker models. That\\'s a claim that requires justification, which they provide via the numbers. However, the actual claim here is that the baselines are weak, which is subjective. Even though they cite numbers, the interpretation that those numbers make the baselines weak is a judgment. \\n\\nAdditionally, the part where they say \"it seems there is still a large gap\" is another judgment. The reviewer is pointing out a discrepancy in performance, which could be a factual statement if the numbers are accurate, but the implication that this gap is significant or problematic is a claim.

Both are supposedly modeled (the latter by feature representation), and need to be defined. Furthermore, it seems like the LHS of equation (7) should be a conditional probability.\\n\\nBreaking this down, the reviewer is pointing out two issues they have with the model\\'s presentation. \\n\\nStarting with part (1): \"What is the pooling method used for embedding features (line 397)?\" This is a question asking for clarification. The reviewer is pointing out that the method isn\\'t specified clearly, so the authors need to explain it. This seems like a request for more information, which under the Normal Statements criteria, is a request for clarification. So that part is a normal statement.\\n\\nMoving to part (2): The reviewer questions the clarity of Equation (7). They ask whether E_i refers to the type or identity of AC i, and mentions that both aspects are modeled. They also state that the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation should be a conditional probability. \\n\\nBreaking this down further: The first part is again a request for clarification (needing definitions for E_i), which is a normal statement. However, the second part says \"it seems like the LHS of equation (7) should be a conditional probability.\" Here, the reviewer is making a judgment that the equation is incorrect or could be better presented as a conditional probability. This is a suggestion or a judgment about the equation\\'s formulation. \\n\\nThe key here is whether this is a claim. The reviewer is asserting that the LHS \"should\" be a conditional probability. That\\'s a suggestion for change, which falls under the \"Suggestions or requests for changes\" category in the Claims section. Additionally, stating that the equation is \"not clear enough\" is a judgment about the clarity, which is another claim. \\n\\nThe reviewer also mentions that both type and identity are modeled but need to be defined. That\\'s pointing out an omission, which could be seen as a claim that the current explanation is insufficient. \\n\\nHowever, the part where they say \"it seems like...\" might be a bit ambiguous. But the overall structure here is pointing out issues that the authors need to address. The request to define terms and correct the equation structure are actionable suggestions. \\n\\nTherefore, the main elements here are the judgment on clarity and the suggestion to rephrase the equation. Both of these are claims because they require the authors to either justify their current approach or make changes based on the reviewer\\'s opinion. \\n\\nEven though some parts are requests for clarification (which are normal), the presence of the judgment (\"not clear enough\") and the suggestion (\"should be a conditional probability\") means the statement as a whole includes claims. The reviewer is not just asking for more info but is making an assertion about what\\'s needed to improve the paper. \\n\\nSo, according to the scoring criteria, since there are claims (judgments and suggestions), the score should be \"Yes\".\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review point includes both requests for clarification and explicit judgments/suggestions.

Wait, the phrasing \"dropped lower\" could be a factual comparison if the numbers are there. For example, if without RL it went down by 10% and without the tree by 5%, then the statement is factual.

They say over-parametrization is helpful, which is a counter to the authors\\' claim. They also mention seeing theoretical work supporting this, providing some references. \\n\\nIs this a claim? The reviewer is making a judgment that the authors\\' statement is incorrect. That\\'s a subjective disagreement with the paper\\'s content. Also, they suggest that the authors\\' assertion might be wrong by citing existing work. This requires evidence (the cited papers) to support their point. \\n\\nThe part where they say \"over-parameterization seems to be very helpful...\" is an opinion or a factual statement? Since they back it with examples and references, maybe it\\'s a factual claim? Wait, but the key here is whether the reviewer\\'s statement is a claim. The reviewer is making a factual statement about existing work, but the act of pointing out that the authors\\' claim is contradicted by existing literature is a form of judgment. \\n\\nThe reviewer is essentially saying the authors\\' statement is incorrect, which is a claim because it\\'s a disagreement with the paper\\'s content. The references are provided as evidence, so this might actually be a normal statement? Wait, no. The criteria says that a claim is when evidence is required. Since the reviewer is making a point that the authors\\' statement is wrong and cites evidence, that\\'s a claim. Wait, but the reviewer\\'s own statement is a factual claim? Hmm, maybe I need to parse it again.\\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s main points:\\n1. The authors\\' statement about over-parametrization overfitting is contradicted by practical experience and theory.\\n2. They provide examples (theoretical work like [1]) to back this up.\\n\\nThe first part is a judgment that the authors\\' assertion is incorrect. That\\'s a claim because it\\'s a disagreement. The second part is providing evidence. Since the reviewer is making a claim that the authors\\' statement is wrong, that\\'s a subjective judgment. Even if they cite references, the act of pointing out the discrepancy is a claim. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer just stated \"over-parametrization is beneficial according to [1]\", that might be a normal statement. But here, they are contrasting it with the authors\\' claim, which is a form of disagreement. Therefore, this is a claim. \\n\\nSo the answer should be \"Yes\" because the reviewer is making a judgment that the authors\\' statement is incorrect, which requires evidence (the cited works) to support. The reviewer is not just stating a fact but is challenging the authors\\' claim, thus making it a claim under the criteria.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:** The reviewer challenges the authors\\' assertion about over-parametrization by presenting an opposing viewpoint supported by references to existing theoretical work. This constitutes a **judgment** (disagreeing with the authors\\' claim) and **deductions** (linking over-parametrization to benefits in supervised learning), which require evidence (e.g., cited papers) to validate.

The first sentence says the comparison is \"a bit unfair.\" That\\'s a judgment, right? The reviewer is making a claim that the comparison isn\\'t fair. Then they explain why: they\\'re pointing out that the proposed method was pre-trained, but it\\'s unclear if others were too. This part is a factual observation? Or is it a claim? The reviewer is pointing out a possible inconsistency in the experimental setup. \\n\\nThe second part mentions Table 1 and states that without SSL, the proposed method does worse. That\\'s a factual statement based on the data. But the first part about the comparison being unfair is definitely a judgment. The reviewer is suggesting that the comparison might not be apples-to-apples because of the pre-training difference. \\n\\nThe key here is whether the statement includes a claim that needs justification. The \"unfair\" part is an opinion. The reviewer is implying that the authors didn\\'t set up the comparison properly, which is a claim that requires evidence. Even though they reference Table 1, the core issue is the fairness of the comparison, which is a subjective judgment. \\n\\nAlso, the reviewer is making a suggestion indirectly—maybe the authors should check if other methods were pre-trained similarly. But the main point is the claim about the comparison\\'s fairness. Since the reviewer is making a judgment (unfair) and suggesting there\\'s an issue in the methodology, this is a claim. Even if part of it is factual (the pre-training part), the overall statement is a claim because it\\'s a judgment that requires verification. \\n\\nSo, according to the scoring criteria, if there\\'s a claim (like the comparison being unfair), then it\\'s a \"Yes.\" The factual part about Table 1 is there, but the main thrust is the judgment.

It then questions whether competing methods were initialized under equivalent conditions, implying a potential flaw in the experimental setup. While the latter part references factual data (Table 1 results), the core assertion about the comparison being \"unfair\" is a claim requiring justification.

The reviewer also references a specific table in a paper, which provides some justification. \\n\\nThe suggestion to test the method with those better embeddings is a recommendation for change, which is a suggestion. The part about better options existing is a claim that requires verification through the cited work.

The mention of existing better options and the suggestion to use them fit the \"Yes\" category because they involve opinions or suggestions requiring justification, even though there\\'s a reference. The positive \"good for fair comparison\" might be a normal statement, but the rest tips it into a claim.

These statements involve a judgment about the availability of superior alternatives (a **claim**) and a suggestion for the authors to explore them (a **request for change**).

Since the reviewer uses the exact term \"pristine set of tweets,\" it\\'s likely that this is a specific part of the paper, like a section or subsection discussing the dataset. The mention of \"collected \\'pristine\\' set\" suggests that the authors have a specific dataset named or described in their work. \\n\\nHowever, the comment doesn\\'t explicitly reference a section number, table, or figure.

So, the authors can identify the dataset section as the part being addressed. \\n\\nNow for specificity: The reviewer is pointing out that the dataset might have noise, specifically mentioning misinformation and out-of-context images in the pristine set. They also want more analysis on dataset quality and noise. This is specific because it\\'s not just saying \"the dataset is bad,\" but rather pointing out types of noise (misinformation, out-of-context images) and requesting analysis on the dataset\\'s quality and noise levels. \\n\\nPutting it together: The comment is grounded because it refers to the dataset and specifically the \"pristine set,\" which should be a defined part of the paper.

From what I understand, each input (h_i) to the temporal network is the average of the representations of all instantiations of context filled by every possible entity in the vocabulary. This does not seem to be a good idea since presumably only one of those instantiations is correct. This would most likely introduce a lot of noise.\"\\n\\nStarting with Grounding: The comment mentions \"the description of HIERENC\". HIERENC is likely a specific part of the paper, maybe a section, method, or model component. The reviewer is pointing out that the description here is unclear. Since HIERENC is a specific term, the authors should know exactly which part they\\'re referring to. However, the comment doesn\\'t explicitly state the section number or page where HIERENC is described. But if HIERENC is a named component (like a model or algorithm), it\\'s probably clearly identifiable in the paper\\'s sections, like in the methodology. So maybe that\\'s enough for full grounding? Or is it weak because it doesn\\'t mention a section?\\n\\nNext, Specificity: The reviewer explains their understanding of how HIERENC works (averaging all entity instantiations) and argues that this introduces noise because only one is correct. They specify the issue with the method\\'s approach, pointing out the potential noise from averaging incorrect entities. This is a clear problem statement about why the current approach might be flawed. The reviewer is not just saying \"this is unclear\" but explaining their interpretation and why it\\'s problematic. \\n\\nWait, but the first part says the description is unclear. So maybe the grounding is about pointing out the unclear part. Since they refer to HIERENC\\'s description, even without a section number, if HIERENC is a named component, the authors can find where it\\'s described. That would be full grounding. The specificity part is strong because they explain the misunderstanding (averaging all entities) and the consequence (noise). \\n\\nSo, Grounding: Full because HIERENC is a specific term in the paper. Specificity: They detail the misunderstanding and the problem, so that\\'s specific. So this should be a 5? \\n\\nBut let me check the scale again. \\n\\nLevel 5 requires both full grounding and specificity. The examples include pointing out a specific part and explaining the issue. Here, the reviewer is pointing to HIERENC\\'s description, which is specific, and then explains the problem with how it\\'s implemented. That fits. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the grounding is weak if the exact section isn\\'t mentioned. But the term HIERENC itself might be enough. For example, if the paper has a section titled \"HIERENC Method\" or similar, then the authors can find it. So I think it\\'s fully grounded. \\n\\nTherefore, the score should be 5. Wait, but let me check other examples. For instance, in the first example with tables 3 and 4, they explicitly named the tables. Here, HIERENC is a model name, so maybe it\\'s similar. The example in the scale for 5 includes mentioning a figure by number, but here it\\'s a named component. So yes, that\\'s full grounding. The specificity is there because the reviewer explains the issue with the averaging approach. \\n\\nSo the rationale would be that the comment is fully grounded by referring to HIERENC\\'s description, allowing authors to identify the section. The specificity is clear as the reviewer explains their understanding of the method\\'s flaw. Hence, score 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly refers to \"the description of HIERENC,\" which is a specific component or method in the paper, allowing authors to identify the exact section or part of the paper being addressed. This constitutes **full grounding**. Additionally, the reviewer provides a clear explanation of the issue: the method\\'s approach of averaging representations from all possible entities introduces noise because only one instantiation is correct. This specificity clarifies both the misunderstanding in the description and the problem with the proposed approach. The comment thus meets the criteria for **full specificity**.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Explanation:** The comment is fully grounded (identifies HIERENC’s description) and fully specific (details the flaw in the method and its consequences), aligning with **Category 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)**.']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The comment is asking why the authors selected only 10 answers out of all correct answers and whether this selection might lead to an underestimation of performance. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the grounding. The reviewer refers to the selection of 10 answers from correct ones. The question is about a specific methodological choice, so does the comment point to a particular section in the paper where this selection is described? The comment doesn\\'t mention a section, figure, or table. The authors might know where they discussed their selection process, but without explicit references like \"in Section X\" or \"in the methodology,\" it\\'s a bit vague. However, the mention of selecting 10 answers is a unique enough detail that the authors can likely find where that\\'s discussed. So maybe it\\'s weakly grounded because it\\'s not explicitly pointing to a section but refers to a specific part of their methodology.\\n\\nNext, specificity. The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with the selection process affecting performance evaluation. They ask two questions: why the selection was made and if it underestimates performance. This gives clear direction on what needs addressing. The authors need to explain their choice and assess the impact. The specificity is there because it\\'s pointing out a possible flaw in the methodology\\'s design.\\n\\nPutting it together: Grounding is weak because it doesn\\'t cite a specific location in the paper, but the reference to selecting 10 answers is specific enough. The specificity is good because the issue is clearly stated. Wait, the Grounding Specificity Scale says that grounding is more important. Since it\\'s weakly grounded but specific, that would be category 3 (Weakly Grounded and Specific). But let me double-check the examples. \\n\\nLooking at example for 3: \"The notation used for the equations is not the same, and it varies between different equations.\" That\\'s weakly grounded because it doesn\\'t point to specific equations but refers to a general issue. The current review point is similar: it refers to a specific action (selecting 10 answers) without pointing to where that\\'s described. So yes, weak grounding. The specificity is there because the problem is clearly stated. So the score should be 3.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment addresses the specific methodological choice of selecting only 10 answers from all correct answers and questions its potential impact on performance evaluation. While it does not explicitly reference a section, table, or figure in the paper, the mention of this selection process provides enough detail for the authors to identify the relevant part of their methodology (e.g., data selection or experimental setup). However, the lack of an explicit reference (e.g., \"in Section X\" or \"in the experimental design\") means the grounding remains weak. The specificity is strong because the reviewer clearly identifies the issue (the limited selection of answers) and raises a critical question about its methodological implications (potential underestimation of performance).  \\n\\n**Score:** 3  \\n**Explanation:**  \\n- **Grounding:** Weakly grounded because the comment does not explicitly cite a section, table, or figure. However, the specificity of the issue (selecting 10 answers) allows the authors to infer the relevant part of the paper.  \\n- **Specificity:** The comment specifies the problem (selecting only 10 answers) and its potential consequence (underestimation of performance), providing clear direction for the authors.  \\n- **Category:** Weakly Grounded and Specific (Score 3).']\n",

The comment explains that the data selection is a subset of Li et al.

The two main components are Grounding and Specificity. Grounding refers to how well the comment points to a specific part of the paper. Specificity is about how clearly the issue is explained.\\n\\nStarting with Grounding: The comment explicitly mentions \"Table 1\" and refers to the \"average duration\" reported there. That\\'s a direct reference to a specific part of the paper. The authors can immediately go to Table 1 and look at the average duration entry. So this is fully grounded because it\\'s pointing to an exact location.\\n\\nNow for Specificity: The reviewer is asking two things. First, they want to know the purpose of the average duration being reported. They point out there\\'s no supporting explanation, so the authors need to clarify why that metric is included. Second, they specifically ask if the duration includes user wait time for model response. This gives clear direction on what\\'s missing in the explanation. The reviewer isn\\'t just saying \"explain more,\" but is pointing out a specific ambiguity in how the metric is defined. That\\'s pretty specific because it tells the authors exactly what part of the explanation is lacking and what they need to address.\\n\\nComparing to the scale examples, this seems like a 5. The examples for 5 include things like mentioning a table and explaining exactly what\\'s wrong (like alignment issues or needing specific experiments). Here, the reviewer is pointing to Table 1, the exact data point (average duration), and specifies that the explanation is missing, particularly about including user wait time. That\\'s both fully grounded and specific. \\n\\nWait, but let me check the categories again. The Fully Grounded and Specific (5) requires both explicit mention of the part and clear specification of the issue. The example given for 5 includes mentioning a table and saying the results are small, making interpretation hard. This case is similar: Table 1\\'s average duration lacks explanation, and the reviewer specifies a particular aspect (whether it includes user wait time). \\n\\nThe only thing to consider is if the specificity is there. The reviewer isn\\'t just saying \"explain Table 1\\'s average duration,\" but is pointing out a specific ambiguity in its definition. That\\'s definitely specific. So yes, this should be a 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly references \"Table 1\" and the \"average duration\" metric within it, providing full grounding. It also specifies two clear issues: (1) the lack of an explanation for the purpose of reporting the average duration and (2) the ambiguity about whether the duration includes user wait time for model responses. These details offer precise guidance on what needs clarification, making the comment fully grounded and specific.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n\\n**Explanation:**  \\n- **Grounding:** The mention of \"Table 1\" and the specific metric (\"average duration\") allows the authors to pinpoint the exact part of the paper being addressed.  \\n- **Specificity:** The reviewer explicitly highlights the absence of an explanation for the metric’s purpose and questions a critical aspect of its definition (whether it includes user wait time).

That\\'s pretty clear. The issue is specifically about the data splits in Table 4 related to ATIS.

They suggest correcting the wording. This is a clear issue with the specific phrasing at line 791.

The reviewer says \"this wording should be corrected\" but doesn\\'t give an example of better wording. However, the problem is clearly identified: the phrase \"on par or better\" might be misused due to cognitive bias.

But since baselines are typically discussed in the methodology or experiments sections, authors can infer the relevant part. So maybe it\\'s weakly grounded? Wait, but mentioning the MST baseline by name might be enough for the authors to find it. If the MST is a specific part of their work, then it\\'s grounded. \\n\\nSpecificity: The reviewer points out that the comparison to models that only use senses (not sememes) is unclear. They suggest that the MST might be such a model but it\\'s not described well. They also mention that the paper emphasizes soft vs. hard WSD instead. The suggestion is to include more baselines. The reviewer is specific about the type of baseline (models not using sememes) and mentions MST as a possible example. They also note that the current description is insufficient. This gives the authors a clear direction: check the MST baseline description, ensure it\\'s clear that it\\'s a model without sememes, and add more such baselines. \\n\\nSo Grounding: Since MST is named, and the issue is about the baseline\\'s description, it\\'s fully grounded. The authors can find where MST is discussed. \\n\\nSpecificity: The reviewer specifies that the MST\\'s description is insufficient in this aspect and that more baselines are needed. That\\'s specific enough. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific). Wait, but let me check the scale again. \\n\\nWait, the examples for 5 include things like explicitly mentioning a section or figure and specifying the issue. Here, MST is mentioned, which is a specific part. The problem is that the MST\\'s role as a model not using sememes isn\\'t described well. The reviewer also suggests adding more baselines. So the comment is both grounded (MST is a specific part) and specific (they need to describe MST\\'s baseline properly and add others). \\n\\nAlternatively, if the MST is a baseline that\\'s already in the paper, then the authors can go to where MST is discussed. The reviewer is pointing to that section and explaining that the description there is lacking. So yes, that\\'s fully grounded and specific. \\n\\nSo the score should be 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly references the \"MST baseline\" as a potential example of a model that considers senses but not sememes, which grounds the comment to a specific element in the paper. The authors can identify the section discussing the MST baseline. The specificity is strong because the reviewer clarifies that the MST\\'s description is insufficient (focusing on soft vs. hard WSD instead of contrasting with sememe-based models) and suggests adding more baselines from related work. This provides clear guidance on what needs improvement.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reasoning:** The comment is **fully grounded** (references the MST baseline by name) and **specific** (identifies the lack of clarity in comparing models and the need for additional baselines).

The comment says: \"It\\'s a bit unclear how the frame similarity factors and attributes similarity factors are selected.\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate the grounding and specificity based on the criteria provided. \\n\\nStarting with grounding: The comment mentions specific terms like \"frame similarity factors\" and \"attributes similarity factors.\" These are likely unique elements in the paper, so they might be sections, methods, or parts of the methodology where these factors are discussed. The reviewer is pointing out that the selection process for these factors isn\\'t clear. Since the terms are specific to the paper\\'s content, the authors should be able to identify which part of their work this refers to, even if the exact section isn\\'t named. The grounding here is probably weak because it doesn\\'t explicitly mention a section, table, or figure, but the terms themselves might be unique enough to point to a specific part. \\n\\nNext, specificity: The reviewer is saying the selection process is unclear. They want more details on how these factors were chosen. The comment specifies the issue (unclear selection) but doesn\\'t give examples of what\\'s missing or how to improve it. The authors know the factors are in question but might need to look into their methodology or explanation sections. The specificity is there because the problem is about the selection process, but it\\'s not detailed on what exactly needs to be added (like criteria, methods, or examples). \\n\\nPutting it together: Since the terms are specific to the paper, the grounding is weak but not non-existent. The specificity is present because the issue is clearly about the selection process. So this would be a weakly grounded and specific comment, which is category 3. But wait, let me check the examples again. \\n\\nLooking at the scale, category 3 is weakly grounded but specific. The examples include things like \"Some figures need their captions to be more precise...\" which is similar here. The reviewer here is pointing to a specific aspect (selection of factors) but doesn\\'t say exactly where in the paper that\\'s discussed. So yes, category 3. \\n\\nWait, but the terms \"frame similarity factors\" and \"attributes similarity factors\" might be terms defined in the paper. If they are unique terms, that could count as full grounding. Hmm. The definition says grounding can be achieved through mentions of unique elements. If those terms are unique to the paper, then the authors can pinpoint exactly where those terms are discussed. For example, if the paper has a section explaining these factors, then the mention of their names would be enough. \\n\\nSo maybe the grounding is full? Let me think again. The comment doesn\\'t mention a section, figure, or table, but the terms themselves are specific to the paper. If those terms are only used in one section, then the authors can find where. So perhaps full grounding. \\n\\nThen specificity: The comment says it\\'s unclear how they are selected. The authors need to explain the selection process. That\\'s specific enough. So if the grounding is full, then it would be category 5 (fully grounded and specific) if the specificity is there. Wait, the specificity part requires details on what\\'s wrong. The comment says the selection is unclear. That\\'s a clear issue, but does it specify what needs to be addressed? Like, maybe the authors need to add more details on the criteria, the process, or examples. The comment points out the problem but doesn\\'t give specifics on how to fix it beyond making it clear. \\n\\nWait, the specificity part is about whether the comment details what is wrong or missing. Here, the problem is the selection process is unclear. The reviewer is saying that the explanation of how the factors were selected is missing or insufficient. So the specificity is there because it identifies the issue (lack of clarity in selection process). The comment is specific in stating that the selection isn\\'t clear, so the authors know they need to explain that part better. \\n\\nTherefore, if the grounding is full (because the terms are unique to the paper and the authors can find where they are discussed), then this would be category 5. But if the grounding is only weak because it doesn\\'t explicitly reference a section, then it\\'s category 3. \\n\\nHmm, the key is whether the terms are unique enough. If \"frame similarity factors\" and \"attributes similarity factors\" are terms that are only used in one specific part of the paper, then the authors can find that part. For example, if they are defined in the methodology section, then mentioning them is enough. Since the reviewer can assume that the authors have a section where these factors are introduced, the grounding is full. \\n\\nTherefore, this would be fully grounded (since the terms are unique to the paper) and specific (the issue is the unclear selection process). So the score would be 5. \\n\\nWait, but let me check the examples again. For instance, the example for category 5 includes a comment that mentions a specific part (like \"defining the UFE-layer as graph-based aggregation\") and then specifies the issue (not experimentally demonstrated). \\n\\nIn our case, the terms are specific, so that\\'s the grounding.

The reviewer refers to line 778 and points out that the phrase \"latent in verbs\" doesn\\'t mention objects. The line number here is explicit, so that\\'s fully grounded.

The first part refers to Section 2.3 and mentions the use of a specific model (Lample et al. Bi-LSTM-CRF). The reviewer suggests adding information about the input being word embeddings, similar to the original work. The second part addresses Figure 3, asking whether \"KNs\" (probably \"Knowns\" or a specific term) are in the source language or English, given that mentions are translated to English. The authors have already responded that they\\'ll correct the figure, but I need to focus on the review point itself, not the response.\\n\\nStarting with Grounding: The first part explicitly mentions Section 2.3 and the model used there. That\\'s a clear reference, so authors can pinpoint the exact section. The second part refers to Figure 3 and the context of translations, so again, Figure 3 is explicitly named. Both parts are explicitly grounded because they reference specific sections and figures. \\n\\nNow, Specificity: The first part specifies that the input should mention word embeddings, similar to Lample et al.\\'s approach. This tells the authors exactly what to add and why (to align with the cited work). The second part asks a question about the language of KNs in Figure 3, given that mentions are translated.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the Grounding Specificity of the given review comment. Let me start by recalling the aspect definition. Grounding Specificity has two parts: Grounding and Specificity. \\n\\nFirst, Grounding refers to how well the comment points to a specific part of the paper. The review comment here is talking about the experiments being a weakness. It mentions that the experiments are only on an extremely low-resource regime and focuses on sentence classification, an easier task. The reviewer also notes that the method\\'s potential for other NLP tasks wasn\\'t shown.\\n\\nLooking at Grounding: The comment specifically addresses the experiments section. It points out the experimental setup (low-resource regime) and the task (sentence classification). Even though it doesn\\'t mention a section number or a specific part like a table or figure, the term \"experiments\" is a common section in papers. The issues raised are about the experimental design and tasks chosen. The authors can likely identify that the reviewer is referring to their experiments section. So this might be \"Fully Grounded\" because \"experiments\" is a standard section, and the critique is about the experimental setup and tasks. But wait, the examples in the scale for \"Fully Grounded\" often mention sections, tables, figures, or unique aspects. Here, the reviewer didn\\'t explicitly mention a section number or a specific part like \"Section 3.2\" but is clearly talking about the experiments as a whole. Since experiments are a standard section, this should be fully grounded.\\n\\nNow Specificity: The comment explains that the experiments are limited to low-resource settings and an easier task (sentence classification), and that the method\\'s application to other tasks wasn\\'t demonstrated. It specifies the shortcomings in the experimental design (only low-resource, only sentence classification) and suggests expanding to other tasks. The reviewer is pointing out that the experiments don\\'t cover more scenarios relevant to real-world applications. This is pretty clear on what\\'s wrong: the experiments are too narrow in scope. So the Specificity is there because it details the issues with the experiments\\' scope and tasks. \\n\\nBut wait, the scale says that for a 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific), the comment must specify what needs to be addressed. Here, the reviewer is saying the experiments should include more than low-resource and sentence classification, and show use on other NLP tasks. That\\'s a specific direction for improvement. So this seems to meet the criteria for a 5. \\n\\nBut let me check the examples again. For instance, the example for 5 mentions \"In defining the UFE-layer...\" with a specific reference and clear issue. Another example is about Table 2\\'s small differences making interpretation hard. The current review point is similar: it\\'s pointing to the experiments (grounded) and specifying the problem (limited scope, task choice). So yes, that\\'s fully grounded and specific. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the Grounding is weak because it\\'s not pointing to a specific subsection or part of the experiments? The reviewer says \"the experiments\" generally, not a specific part like \"Figure 5\" or \"Section 4.2\". But \"experiments\" as a section is standard, so it\\'s still fully grounded. The comment is clear enough for authors to know they need to address their experimental setup and tasks. \\n\\nTherefore, the score should be 5. Wait, but let me check if there\\'s any under-specificity. The reviewer says \"the proposed augmentation method has potential to be used on more NLP tasks, which was unfortunately not shown.\" That\\'s a specific suggestion: test on other tasks. So yes, it tells them what to do. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the Grounding is okay but the Specificity is there. So I think this is a 5. Wait, but let me check the example for 4 (Fully Grounded and Under-Specific). The example for 4 is like \"In Figure 7, the results... show SurfGAN seems out of place.\" But it doesn\\'t say what\\'s wrong. Here, the current comment does say what\\'s wrong (limited scope, task choice), so it\\'s more specific. \\n\\nTherefore, the score should be 5. But wait, another thought: the reviewer mentions \"the experiments, which is understandable for a short paper\". So maybe the reviewer is acknowledging the paper\\'s constraints but still pointing out the weakness. The grounding is still there. \\n\\nYes, I think this is a 5. The comment is fully grounded (experiments section) and specific in detailing the issues (low-resource only, sentence classification, lack of other tasks).

Grounding refers to how clearly the comment points to a specific part of the paper. The reviewer is talking about the concept map extraction task, which is likely a section in the paper where the authors present their approach or methodology. However, the comment doesn\\'t explicitly mention a section, figure, or table where this task is discussed. The authors might know where they introduced the concept map as a separate task, but without a direct reference, it\\'s a bit ambiguous. \\n\\nSpecificity is about whether the comment clearly states what\\'s wrong or missing.

The question is whether the comment explicitly references a section, table, figure, or unique element. The term \"annotation\" is a key part here, so if the paper\\'s methodology discusses expert annotation, the authors can find the relevant section. However, the comment doesn\\'t explicitly mention a section number or figure, so it\\'s relying on the authors to connect it to their methodology.

The reviewer is asking for more details in the paper about the experts\\' traits and the rationale for using experts beyond commercial reasons. So the issues are clearly outlined. The specificity is there because it\\'s telling the authors exactly what information is missing and what they need to add. \\n\\nPutting it together: The grounding is weak because it references \"the first point\" without explicit section details, but it\\'s about the annotation process, which should be in the methodology.

While I don\\'t think the hypotheses are phrased optimally (could they be tested as given?), their underlying ideas are valuable. However, the paper actually does not really study these hypotheses (nor are they even mentioned/discussed again). I found this not only misleading, but I would have also liked the paper to go deeper into the respective topics, at least to some extent.\\n\\nAlright, let\\'s break this down. \\n\\nFirst, grounding: The reviewer mentions specific lines (078-086) where the hypotheses are presented. That\\'s a clear reference to a specific part of the paper. The hypotheses are about multilinguality and country/language-specific bias. The comment also points out that the hypotheses aren\\'t discussed again later. So the authors can pinpoint exactly where the hypotheses were introduced (lines 78-86) and that subsequent parts of the paper fail to address them. \\n\\nSo grounding is strong here because of the line numbers and the specific hypotheses mentioned. The authors can easily find that section. \\n\\nNow specificity: The reviewer states that the hypotheses aren\\'t studied or mentioned again, which is a problem. They also mention that the phrasing of the hypotheses might not be optimal for testing. Additionally, the reviewer wants the paper to delve deeper into these topics. \\n\\nThe issues here are: \\n1. The hypotheses are not tested or discussed further after their introduction. \\n2. The way the hypotheses are phrased might make them hard to test as they are. \\n3. The paper should explore these topics more thoroughly. \\n\\nThese are specific points. The reviewer is pointing out that the hypotheses are introduced but not followed up, which is a clear issue. They also suggest that the phrasing could be improved for testability. The request to go deeper into the topics is also specific in the sense that it\\'s about expanding the discussion or analysis related to those hypotheses. \\n\\nSo specificity is there because the reviewer is detailing exactly what\\'s wrong (lack of follow-up, possible phrasing issues) and what needs to be addressed (testing the hypotheses, deeper exploration). \\n\\nLooking at the scale: \\n\\nThe comment is fully grounded because it references specific lines and hypotheses. It\\'s also specific in pointing out the lack of follow-up, potential phrasing issues, and the need for deeper analysis. \\n\\nSo according to the scale, if it\\'s fully grounded and specific, that\\'s a 5. \\n\\nWait, let me check the scale again. \\n\\nThe scale\\'s highest score (5) is \"Fully Grounded and Specific\". \\n\\nThe examples given for 5 include comments that explicitly mention a part of the paper and specify what\\'s wrong. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer mentions lines 78-86, the hypotheses, and says they aren\\'t studied or mentioned again.

That\\'s both grounded and specific. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5. \\n\\nBut let me make sure I\\'m not missing anything. \\n\\nIs there any part where it\\'s under-specific? The reviewer says \"their underlying ideas are valuable\" but doesn\\'t specify how to improve the hypotheses\\' phrasing beyond asking if they can be tested as given. Maybe that part is a bit vague, but the main points are clear: the hypotheses aren\\'t addressed further, which is a specific issue.

The reviewer also highlights the misleading nature of omitting follow-up on the hypotheses, offering actionable guidance for improvement.

That\\'s a specific recommendation. They mention the QWK metric and the previous work\\'s results.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is asking about the use of the Challenge Set (CS).

They specifically ask if the CS is part of the training data and, if so, what the data split is.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check the grounding. The reviewer references the \"Challenge Set\" (CS), which is a specific term. If the paper refers to the CS in a particular section, figure, or table, then that\\'s a good sign of grounding. The term \"Challenge Set\" might be unique enough to point the authors to where it\\'s discussed. The comment is about how the CS is used, so the authors should know where in the paper they describe its usage, like in the methodology or data section. Since the reviewer uses the exact term \"Challenge Set,\" that\\'s a strong indicator of grounding. They might not mention a specific section number or table, but the term itself is a unique identifier. So, the grounding here is probably full because the authors can find where the CS is discussed.\\n\\nNow, specificity. The reviewer is pointing out that the paper isn\\'t clear on whether the CS is used for training augmentation and the data split. They want to know two things: 1) Is the CS used in training? and 2) What\\'s the split if so? That\\'s pretty specific. They\\'re asking for clarification on a particular aspect of data usage, which directly tells the authors what needs to be addressed. The comment specifies the exact information missing, so the specificity is there.\\n\\nWait, but the grounding part—does the comment mention a specific part of the paper where the CS is discussed? The reviewer just refers to \"the Challenge Set\" in general. The authors might have to search their paper for where the CS is introduced and its usage. If the CS is only mentioned in one section, then the grounding is still strong because the term is unique. But if the paper has multiple sections discussing it without clear labeling, maybe it\\'s weaker. But generally, using the exact term should be enough for the authors to find the relevant section. So I think it\\'s fully grounded.\\n\\nTherefore, the comment is fully grounded and specific. The reviewer is pointing to a specific element (CS) and asking for clarification on its use and data split, which tells the authors exactly what to check and improve. That would be a 5.

That fits fully grounded and specific. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the reviewer didn\\'t explicitly mention a section, figure, or table, but the term \"Challenge Set\" is unique enough. Since the paper likely has a section where the CS is described, the authors can locate it. So the grounding is full. The specificity is there because they ask for two specific pieces of information. \\n\\nYes, so this should be a 5. Wait, but let me check the example for 5 again. The example for 5 includes things like \"In defining the UFE-layer...\" which is a specific part. Another example is about Table 2\\'s results being unclear. Here, the term \"Challenge Set\" is specific enough. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the reviewer didn\\'t mention a section, so maybe it\\'s weakly grounded? Hmm. Let me think again. \\n\\nThe definition for full grounding includes literal mentions of sections, tables, figures, or unique elements. The Challenge Set is a unique element of the paper, so mentioning it by name allows the authors to find where it\\'s discussed. Therefore, it\\'s fully grounded. The specificity is there because the reviewer is asking for specific information (whether it\\'s used in training and the split). \\n\\nSo the score should be 5. Wait, but let me check the examples again. For instance, in the example for 5, the comment mentions \"In defining the UFE-layer...\" which is a section. Another example is \"In Figure 7...\" which is a figure. Here, the reviewer is using the term \"Challenge Set\" which is a unique element, so that\\'s equivalent to mentioning a section or figure by name. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5. However, I need to make sure. Wait, the user\\'s examples for 5 include \"The differences in results in Table 2 are very small...\" which is fully grounded (Table 2) and specific (the differences are small, making interpretation hard). \\n\\nIn this case, the review point is asking about the usage of the CS and the data split. The reviewer is pointing out a lack of clarity in how the CS is used (training or not) and the split. So the authors know exactly where to look (the part discussing data splits and CS usage) and what to fix (clarify whether CS is in training and the split). \\n\\nYes, so this is fully grounded and specific. So the score is 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly references the \"Challenge Set (CS)\" as a specific element of the paper, which allows authors to identify the relevant section where the CS is discussed (full grounding). The reviewer’s questions—\"Is this used also to augment the training material? If yes, what is the data split?\"—clearly specify the missing information (specificity). The authors can directly address these points by revisiting their description of the CS’s role in training and data splits.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reasoning:** The comment is **fully grounded** (references the \"Challenge Set\" as a unique element of the paper) and **specific** (asks for clarification on whether the CS is used for training and the associated data split).

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the grounding and specificity according to the given criteria. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the review point thoroughly. The reviewer is commenting on the paper\\'s claim that the model generalizes to different knowledge. They argue that the substructure needs to be represented as a sequence of words and question whether using something like constituent parse counts as \"knowledge\" since it\\'s more about syntax or semantics (like AMR parsing) rather than external knowledge bases.\\n\\nStarting with grounding: Does the comment specify a particular part of the paper? The reviewer mentions the paper\\'s claim about generalization but doesn\\'t point to a specific section, figure, or table. However, they do refer to the term \"knowledge\" as used in the paper, which might be a key term or part of the abstract/introduction where the model\\'s capabilities are described. Since the paper\\'s claim is central, maybe the authors can infer it\\'s related to the introduction or methodology where the model\\'s approach to knowledge is discussed. But without explicit references like section numbers or specific terms, it\\'s not fully grounded. The mention of \"constituent parse\" and \"AMR parsing\" could indicate sections discussing the model\\'s input or data representation. However, it\\'s still a bit vague. So, maybe it\\'s weakly grounded because the authors can make an educated guess but can\\'t pinpoint the exact section.\\n\\nNow, specificity: The reviewer clearly states the issue with how \"knowledge\" is defined in the paper, contrasting it with typical usage (external knowledge bases vs. syntax/semantics). They also question the model\\'s ability to handle non-sequence-based substructures like constituent parses. This provides specific concerns about the terminology and the model\\'s applicability. The reviewer suggests that the term \"knowledge\" is misleading here, which gives the authors clear direction to redefine or clarify their use of the term. The specificity is there because they explain why the terminology is problematic and give examples (constituent parse vs. AMR). \\n\\nPutting it together: The grounding is weak because there\\'s no explicit reference to a section, figure, or table, but the term \"knowledge\" is central and likely discussed in key sections. The specificity is strong because the reviewer explains the issue with the terminology and provides examples. \\n\\nAccording to the scale, if it\\'s weakly grounded but specific, that\\'s a 3.

The example given is about figure captions needing to be precise. In this case, the reviewer\\'s comment is about terminology and model\\'s knowledge type, which is a conceptual point. The authors can infer the sections discussing the model\\'s input or the definition of knowledge, but without explicit references, it\\'s weakly grounded. The specificity is there because they explain the problem with the term and suggest it\\'s misleading. \\n\\nYes, so this should be a 3.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review comment critiques the paper\\'s use of the term \"knowledge\" and questions whether the model\\'s handling of substructures (e.g., constituent parses or AMR) qualifies as \"knowledge\" in the conventional sense. While the comment does not explicitly reference a specific section, figure, or table, it directly addresses a key conceptual claim made by the paper (the model\\'s generalization to \"knowledge\"). The authors can infer that this relates to sections where the term \"knowledge\" is defined or where the model\\'s input representation is discussed. However, the lack of explicit references (e.g., section numbers, figure/table mentions) means the grounding remains weak.  \\n\\nThe specificity is strong, as the reviewer clearly identifies the issue: the term \"knowledge\" is misleading when applied to syntax/semantics (e.g., constituent parses) rather than external knowledge bases. They also provide examples (constituent parse vs. AMR parsing) to clarify their concern, which guides the authors toward redefining their terminology or justifying its use.  \\n\\n**Score:** 3  \\n**Reasoning:** The comment is **weakly grounded** (no explicit references to specific parts of the paper) but **specific** (details the problem with the term \"knowledge\" and its misuse in the context).

The second part\\'s specificity is low because it just says the phrase sounds odd without details. The third part is specific in identifying the ambiguity. \\n\\nThe importance is on grounding over specificity. Since parts are weakly grounded and some are fully, but not all, the overall grounding is weak. The comment as a whole is weakly grounded because not every part is fully grounded.

They don\\'t specify which section, table, or figure is missing these results. The authors might guess it\\'s about the results section or experiments, but it\\'s not explicit. So grounding is weak because they can\\'t pinpoint exactly where the issue is.\\n\\nNow, specificity: The reviewer wants to know how the method applies to popular algorithms and their performance compared to existing DP algorithms. That\\'s a clear request, but does it specify what\\'s missing in the paper? The comment asks for numerical results and comparisons, which tells the authors what to add. However, without pointing to a specific part where this should be addressed (like a section or experiment), the specificity is there in terms of what\\'s needed, but the grounding is still weak.\\n\\nWait, the Importance note says grounding is more important than specificity. Since the comment isn\\'t grounded (doesn\\'t point to a specific part), even if the request is specific, the overall score might be lower. The examples in the scale: for score 2 (weakly grounded and not specific), the comment doesn\\'t specify what needs to be addressed. Here, the request is specific (add numerical results and comparisons), so maybe it\\'s weakly grounded but specific, which would be a 3. But let me check the examples again.\\n\\nLooking at the example for 3: \"Some figures need their captions to be more precise...\" which is weakly grounded (doesn\\'t say which figures) but specific about the captions needing precision. Similarly, the current review point is about numerical results missing, which is a specific request (add numerical results and comparisons) but doesn\\'t point to a specific part. So that aligns with weakly grounded and specific (score 3). \\n\\nAlternatively, if \"Lack of numerical results\" is considered a general comment, maybe it\\'s not specific enough. Wait, the reviewer is asking for numerical results and comparisons, so the specificity is there in terms of what\\'s needed. The problem is the grounding. Since the authors can\\'t tell which part is missing, but the request is clear on what to add, it\\'s a 3. \\n\\nBut another angle: If the paper has a results section, then the comment is implicitly pointing there. But the reviewer didn\\'t mention \"results section\" or a specific part. So the grounding is still weak. The specificity is there because they know to add numerical results and comparisons. So yeah, score 3.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:** The comment highlights the absence of numerical results and asks for comparisons with existing DP algorithms when applied to popular algorithms. While the request is specific in terms of what needs to be addressed (adding numerical results and performance comparisons), it does not explicitly identify which part of the paper is lacking this information (e.g., a specific section, table, or experiment). The authors might infer that this pertains to the results or experiments section, but this requires guessing. Thus, the grounding is weak because the exact location of the issue is not pinpointed. However, the specificity is clear, as the reviewer specifies the type of content needed. This aligns with **category 3 (Weakly Grounded and Specific)**.  \\n\\n**Score:** 3']\n",

Grounding refers to how well the comment points to a specific part of the paper. The reviewer mentions \"experimental comparisons\" and refers to specific methods (MoCo, SimCLR) and backbones (ResNet50 variants). The authors should be able to identify that this is about the experiments section, possibly where they compare their method with others. The mention of specific backbones and other methods gives a clear indication of where to look, so the grounding here is strong. It\\'s not vague like \"the experiments are insufficient,\" but points to specific baselines and architectures.\\n\\nNow, specificity: the comment specifies that the authors should test InvP with wider backbones (ResNet50 2× and 4×) as others have done. This tells the authors exactly what they need to do—run additional experiments with those models. The reviewer even references existing work (MoCo and SimCLR) that did this, so the authors know exactly which experiments to look at for context. The problem identified is clear: not enough comparison with these specific models. The recommendation is specific, so the authors know precisely what to address.\\n\\nIs there any ambiguity? The reviewer doesn\\'t point to a specific section in the paper, like a table or figure, but the term \"experimental comparisons\" is a common section in papers. Since they mention specific methods and backbones, the authors can locate the relevant part (probably in the experiments or results section where they compare with MoCo and SimCLR). So, the grounding is full because it\\'s clear where this applies. The specificity is there because they specify the exact backbones and the need to test them. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific). The comment explicitly mentions the part of the paper (experimental comparisons) and gives a clear directive (test with ResNet50 2× and 4×), which is both grounded and specific.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly references the experimental comparisons and specifies the need to test the proposed InvP method with wider backbones (ResNet50 (2×) and ResNet50 (4×)), similar to how MoCo and SimCLR have been evaluated.

The authors can pinpoint the relevant part of the paper (e.g., the experiments or results section where existing comparisons are presented).

The aspect here is Grounding Specificity, which has two parts: grounding and specificity. Grounding is about how well the comment points to a specific part of the paper, and specificity is about how clearly it explains what\\'s wrong.\\n\\nStarting with grounding: The reviewer mentions \"table 5\" and \"table 3\", and also specifies \"Page 7, section 5, last par.: figure 6 callout\". That\\'s very specific. They\\'re pointing out that a reference (callout) to Table 5 should actually be to Table 3, and in the last paragraph of section 5 on page 7, the reference to Figure 6 isn\\'t directing properly. The exact page, section, and part of the paper are given. So the authors can easily find the exact location where the error is. That\\'s full grounding because they have literal mentions of sections, tables, and figures.\\n\\nNow specificity: The reviewer says the callout to Table 5 should be Table 3 instead. That\\'s pretty clear—the wrong table is referenced there. For the Figure 6 part, they mention the callout isn\\'t directing properly. That\\'s a bit vague. What exactly is wrong? Maybe the figure number is incorrect, or the caption is misreferenced, or the figure isn\\'t pointing to the right data. The reviewer didn\\'t specify the exact issue beyond saying it\\'s not directing properly. However, the first part about the table is specific, and the second part is a bit under-specific. \\n\\nBut wait, the main issue here is that the reviewer is pointing out two specific errors in cross-references. The first part is very clear: the table reference is wrong. The second part about Figure 6 is a bit more vague, but the fact that the callout isn\\'t directing properly might be enough for the authors to check that specific instance. Since the reviewer provided exact locations (page, section, paragraph), the authors can go there and see what\\'s wrong with the figure reference. Even if the exact problem isn\\'t spelled out, the fact that it\\'s pointing to a specific callout gives them a clear place to look. \\n\\nConsidering the Grounding Specificity Scale, the key is whether it\\'s fully grounded.

The specificity part: the first part (table) is specific (wrong table number), but the second part (figure) is a bit under-specific. However, the overall comment is addressing two specific issues with references. The main point here is that the reviewer is pointing out that the cross-references in those exact locations are incorrect. The authors can check those spots and fix the references. \\n\\nLooking at the scale, if it\\'s fully grounded but the specificity is mixed, but the first part is specific. The second part\\'s lack of detail might make the specificity under. But since the reviewer clearly states what the correction should be for the table (should point to table 3 instead of 5), that\\'s specific. The figure part says the callout isn\\'t directing properly, which is a bit vague, but the exact location is given. \\n\\nThe scale says that if it\\'s fully grounded but under-specific, it\\'s a 4. If it\\'s fully grounded and specific, it\\'s a 5. The table part is specific, but the figure part is under.

That\\'s a good sign because pointing to a specific figure allows the authors to know exactly which part of the paper is being discussed.

They reference specific models like DeiT-B, DeiT-T, and mention datasets like APTOS2019, ISIC2019, and CheXpert. These are all specific elements from the paper.

In contrast, CNNs show more consistent improvements except on ISIC2019. This gives clear details about what the issue is and where it\\'s located in the figure. The reviewer isn\\'t just saying \"this is wrong,\" but pointing out exact comparisons and results that contradict the authors\\' claim. \\n\\nSo, Grounding is full because of the explicit mention of Figure 3 and the specific models/datasets.

It clearly points out the issue of spurious features being like triggers and their effect. The authors know exactly where to look and what's being questioned—the nature of spurious features and their potential resemblance to known triggers. They might need to address whether they considered this connection or if their analysis accounts for such impacts. \\n\\nSo, the grounding is full because sections are specified. The specificity is there because the problem is clearly explained with examples and references. Therefore, this should be a 5. Wait, but let me double-check. The comment does mention the problem and provides context but does it specify what needs to be done? The reviewer is suggesting that the authors need to address this similarity, maybe by discussing it, comparing their spurious features with backdoor triggers, or explaining why their case is different. The specificity is about what's wrong, not just pointing out the issue but also implying the need for a deeper analysis or comparison. Since the reviewer provides examples and the reasoning, it's specific enough. So yeah, fully grounded and specific. Score 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly references **Section 3.1 and 3.2**, providing full grounding as the authors can directly locate the part of the paper being addressed. It also clearly specifies the issue: the similarity between the spurious features discussed in these sections and backdoor triggers (e.g., those in Chen et al. 2017 and Gu et al. 2019). The reviewer explains that both involve rare artificial patterns with significant impacts on models, and they highlight the need for the authors to address this connection. This specificity clarifies what needs to be addressed (e.g., comparing spurious features to backdoor triggers, discussing their implications, or justifying differences).  \\n\\n**Score:** 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific)\"]\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The comment says, \"When discussing related work it is crucial to mention related work on modular networks for VQA such as [A], otherwise the introduction right now seems to paint a picture that no one does modular architectures for VQA.\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to apply the Grounding Specificity criteria. Let\\'s break it down into Grounding and Specificity.\\n\\nStarting with Grounding: The reviewer is pointing out that the related work section doesn\\'t mention modular networks for VQA, like the cited work [A]. They specifically mention the \"introduction\" but actually, the related work is usually a separate section. However, the introduction might summarize related work. The comment refers to the related work discussion in the paper. The reviewer mentions the introduction, but maybe they meant the related work section. Either way, the key point is that the comment is about the related work section. The mention of \"related work\" and \"introduction\" gives some grounding. Since they refer to a specific aspect (modular networks for VQA) and even cite [A], which is a specific example, this helps the authors know exactly where to look. The authors can check their related work section to see if they discussed modular architectures and if they cited [A]. So, the grounding here is strong because it points to the related work section and specifies the type of work that\\'s missing. \\n\\nNow, Specificity: The reviewer is clear about what\\'s missing—the mention of modular networks for VQA, like [A]. They explain the problem: the current introduction gives the impression that no prior work uses modular architectures, which isn\\'t accurate. The comment specifies that adding this reference would correct that. The reviewer even provides an example ([A]) which adds to the specificity. They are telling the authors to include this specific type of related work and cite [A], so the authors know exactly what to do. \\n\\nPutting it together: The comment is fully grounded because it clearly identifies the section (related work, possibly in the introduction) and the specific content (modular networks for VQA like [A]). It\\'s also specific because it tells the authors to mention that work and why (to avoid the incorrect implication). \\n\\nLooking at the scale: \\n\\n- **Fully Grounded and Specific (5)**: The comment mentions the section (related work/intro) and specifies the exact issue (missing references to modular networks like [A]). The authors can pinpoint the section and know exactly what to add. \\n\\nWait, but does the comment explicitly mention a section? It says \"when discussing related work\" and refers to the introduction. The related work is a section, so mentioning that they need to include this in their related work discussion is enough for full grounding. The example [A] is given, so it\\'s specific. \\n\\nSo, this should be a 5. However, maybe the mention of \"introduction\" might be slightly ambiguous, but since the related work is a standard section, and the comment is about their discussion of related work, it\\'s clear. The authors can look there. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had said \"in the introduction section\" but the related work is in a separate section, but the key is that the comment is about the related work discussion. So I think this is fully grounded and specific. \\n\\nTherefore, the score should be 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly addresses the related work section (implied by \"when discussing related work\") and highlights the omission of specific prior work on modular networks for VQA (e.g., [A]). It grounds the issue in the paper’s current framing of the introduction, which inaccurately suggests no prior work uses modular architectures. The reviewer provides a concrete example ([A]) to illustrate the missing reference, making the request specific. The authors can confidently identify the relevant section (related work or introduction) and understand precisely what needs to be addressed (adding references to modular networks like [A]).  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Explanation:**  \\n- **Fully Grounded:** The comment identifies the related work section and clarifies the specific gap (lack of discussion on modular networks for VQA).  \\n- **Specific:** The reviewer specifies the missing content (modular architectures like [A]) and the consequence of omitting it (misleading narrative in the introduction).

However, if the paper has standard sections for ablation studies, the authors might know which tables are being referred to. But since the tables aren\\'t explicitly named, it\\'s a bit ambiguous.

First, that the performance drop without RL is greater than without the dependency tree. Second, that the tables don\\'t include cases where both dependency tree and RL are not used. The reviewer is asking for specific data points (the missing cases) to be included. The specifics here are clear: the tables need to have those missing cases. \\n\\nSo, the grounding is about whether the authors can pinpoint which part of the paper is being discussed. Since \"ablation experiment\" is a common section and \"two tables\" are mentioned, but without exact references, it might be weakly grounded. However, if the ablation tables are well-known in the paper, maybe it\\'s fully grounded? Hmm, tricky. The problem is that \"the two tables\" aren\\'t named. If the ablation is in, say, Table 5 and 6, but the reviewer didn\\'t say which, then the authors might have to guess.

Here, the tables are mentioned as \"the two tables\" without numbers.

This indicates **weak grounding**. However, the specificity is clear: the reviewer points out that the tables omit results for cases where both dependency trees and RL are absent, and highlights an inconsistency in performance drops.

The authors consider a single vulnerability at a time, and while they acknowledge and address the data imbalance issue, I am not sure about the ecological validity of such a study. Previous work has considered multiple CVEs or CWEs at a time, and report whether or not the code contains any such vulnerability.

The comment mentions the \"vulnerability discovery methodology,\" which is a specific part of the paper. The authors can probably locate the methodology section where they describe their approach. However, the comment doesn\\'t specify a particular section number, figure, or table. But since it refers to the methodology in general terms, does that count as weak or full grounding? The definition says full grounding can be achieved by mentioning sections or unique aspects. Since \"vulnerability discovery methodology\" is a key part of the paper\\'s contribution, it might be considered a unique aspect. So maybe full grounding here?\\n\\nWait, but the reviewer also mentions \"previous work has considered multiple CVEs or CWEs at a time,\" which is a comparison. The authors might know where they discussed their methodology versus previous work. But does the comment point to a specific part of the paper where this methodology is detailed? It\\'s referring to the methodology section in general, so maybe that\\'s enough for full grounding.\\n\\nNow Specificity: The reviewer is pointing out that the methodology only considers one vulnerability at a time, questioning its ecological validity. They also mention that previous work uses multiple CVEs/CWEs and that the results are hard to interpret or show marginal improvements. The issues are specified: single vulnerability approach vs. multiple, ecological validity, comparison with previous work, and results interpretation.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. First, I need to determine the Grounding Specificity score based on the criteria provided. The review point is about the approach section, specifically discussing the computational expense of optimal transport distance and questions about scalability and the exact computation method.\\n\\nStarting with Grounding: The comment mentions \"Approach\" as the section and refers to the authors\\' indication about computation time on a 36-core machine. The term \"Approach\" is a section in the paper, so that\\'s a literal mention. The reviewer also references specific details like the Sinkhorn method and optimal transport computation. Since they mention the approach section and specific technical aspects (like Sinkhorn method), the authors can pinpoint the relevant part of the paper. That sounds like Full Grounding because it\\'s explicitly mentioning a section and specific content within it.\\n\\nNext, Specificity: The reviewer points out two main issues. First, the scalability on normal machines with fewer cores, which is a clear request for more information on scalability testing. Second, they question how the exact optimal transport is computed since Sinkhorn gives a doubly stochastic matrix. They want to know the exact method to get from the Sinkhorn output to the optimal transport distance. Both of these are specific issues.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the grounding specificity of the given review comment. The comment is about an ablation study missing in the paper. Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions from the aspect description. Grounding Specificity has two parts: grounding and specificity. Grounding is about how well the comment points to a specific part of the paper, and specificity is about how clearly it explains what\\'s wrong or missing.\\n\\nLooking at the review point: The reviewer mentions that some ablation studies are missing, which could cause confusion. They specifically point out that the parameter σ in the RBF kernel isn\\'t analyzed, even though Figure 4 looks at λ. They also mention wanting to see the effects of η and τ from equation (7). \\n\\nStarting with grounding: The reviewer references specific elements like the RBF kernel\\'s σ, Figure 4, and equation (7) with parameters η and τ. These are all explicit mentions of parts of the paper. The authors can pinpoint exactly which sections or figures are in question. The mention of Figure 4 and equation (7) gives clear locations. So the grounding here is full because they reference specific parts.\\n\\nNow specificity: The comment clearly states that the analysis of σ is missing, and that η and τ in equation (7) should be tested. It\\'s not just saying \"more analysis needed,\" but pointing out specific parameters that weren\\'t studied. The reviewer is telling the authors exactly which parameters to look into and in which context (ablation studies). That\\'s pretty specific. They also mention that the absence of this analysis causes confusion, which gives a reason why it\\'s important.\\n\\nWait, but the scale says that even if it\\'s fully grounded, if it\\'s under-specific, it\\'s a 4. But here, the specificity is there. The reviewer is not just saying \"analyze more parameters,\" but naming σ, η, τ, and referencing where they are discussed. So this should be fully grounded and specific. \\n\\nWait, let me check the examples again. For a 5, the example includes mentioning a specific section and explaining what\\'s wrong, like in the UFE-layer example. Here, the reviewer is pointing to Figure 4 and equation (7), which are specific parts, and clearly stating that certain parameters aren\\'t analyzed. That\\'s both grounded and specific. \\n\\nSo the score should be 5. But wait, the user\\'s previous examples had similar structures. For instance, the Table 4 example where they asked about splits used for ATIS numbers was a 5 because it was specific. Here, the reviewer is specifying parameters in equations and figures, so that\\'s even more explicit. \\n\\nHmm, but wait, the reviewer says \"some ablation study is missing\" which is a bit general, but then gives examples with σ, Figure 4, and equation (7). The examples make it specific. So yes, the comment is fully grounded (because of the references to Figure 4, equation 7, parameters) and specific in what\\'s missing (analysis of σ, η, τ). \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5. But let me check the scale again. \\n\\nLooking at the scale:\\n\\n5 is fully grounded and specific. The examples given for 5 include mentioning specific parts and explaining what\\'s wrong. \\n\\nIn this case, the comment is pointing out that in the existing analysis (like Figure 4 for λ), but not for σ, η, τ. So the authors know exactly which parts (equation 7, figure 4) and which parameters are lacking analysis. \\n\\nYes, that\\'s fully grounded and specific. So the score is 5. \\n\\nWait, but in the previous example where the reviewer mentioned Table 3 needing improvement but not specifying why, that was a 4. Here, the reviewer is specifying exactly which parameters in which equations and figures are not analyzed, so it\\'s more specific. \\n\\nTherefore, the rationale should state that the comment is fully grounded (references Figure 4, equation 7, parameters) and specific in pointing out missing analysis of σ, η, τ.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The comment says, \"1) The paper was extremely hard to follow. I read it multiple times and still had trouble following the exact experimental procedures and evaluations that the authors conducted.\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate the grounding and specificity based on the aspect description. Grounding is about whether the reviewer points to a specific part of the paper. Here, the reviewer mentions difficulty in following the experimental procedures and evaluations. But they don\\'t specify which sections, tables, or figures these are in. The authors might guess it\\'s the Methods or Results sections, but it\\'s not explicit. So, the grounding is weak because the exact location isn\\'t mentioned. \\n\\nNow, specificity: The reviewer is pointing out that the experimental procedures and evaluations are unclear. That\\'s a bit more specific than just saying \"the paper is unclear.\" They mention the exact part being the experimental procedures and evaluations, so the authors know the general area to look at. However, the comment doesn\\'t detail what exactly is unclear—like missing steps, lack of details, or confusing explanations. The authors know the section but not the exact issue within it. \\n\\nAccording to the scale, if it\\'s weakly grounded but specifies the part (experimental procedures and evaluations), maybe it\\'s a 3? Wait, the examples for 3 are like \"some figures need precise captions\" or \"notation varies between equations.\" Here, the comment does specify the part (experimental procedures and evaluations), so maybe it\\'s weakly grounded but specific. Wait, but the definition for 3 says \"the authors cannot confidently determine which part the comment addresses.\" Hmm, the reviewer does mention experimental procedures and evaluations, which are specific parts of the paper. So maybe the grounding is better than weak? \\n\\nWait, the Grounding Specificity Scale says \"Weakly Grounded\" is when the author can make an educated guess but not pinpoint exactly. Since the reviewer points to experimental procedures and evaluations, that\\'s a specific section (Methods and Results), so maybe it\\'s actually Fully Grounded? But the problem is the reviewer didn\\'t mention a section number or figure/table. The question is whether mentioning \"experimental procedures and evaluations\" is enough to be \"fully grounded.\" The examples given for Fully Grounded include things like \"In Figure 7\" or \"Table 1,\" but also \"unique elements of the paper.\" \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \"experimental procedures\" is a general section, so it\\'s still weakly grounded because the exact subsection or part isn\\'t mentioned. The reviewer could be referring to a particular method description or a specific experiment in the results. Without more details, the authors might not know exactly where the confusion is. \\n\\nSo Grounding is Weak because it\\'s not pointing to a specific section (like Methods section or a particular subsection), just a general area. Specificity: The comment is specific in saying that the procedures and evaluations are unclear, but doesn\\'t say what\\'s wrong with them. So it\\'s not under-specific? Wait, under-specific is when it\\'s fully grounded but doesn\\'t say what\\'s wrong. Here, since it\\'s weakly grounded, but the specificity part is that they mention the problem (unclear procedures and evaluations). \\n\\nLooking at the examples for Weakly Grounded and Specific (score 3): \"Some figures need their captions to be more precise...\" or \"The notation used for the equations is not the same...\" Those specify what\\'s wrong. In this case, the problem is that the procedures and evaluations are hard to follow. That\\'s a specific issue but the location is not precisely pinpointed. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s Weakly Grounded and Not Specific (score 2). Because the comment says \"had trouble following the exact experimental procedures and evaluations\" but doesn\\'t specify what exactly is wrong with them. The authors know the area (procedures and evaluations) but not what part of those is unclear. For example, is the problem in the description of the experiments, the setup, the data, the analysis steps? The reviewer didn\\'t say. So the specificity is lacking because it doesn\\'t detail what needs to be addressed. \\n\\nComparing to the example for score 2: \"For many of the datasets tested, the improvement over other approaches is marginal.\" That\\'s Weakly Grounded (which datasets?) and not specific (what\\'s the issue with the improvement being marginal?). Wait, actually that example is listed under Weakly Grounded and Not Specific (score 2). Hmm. \\n\\nAnother example for score 3: \"The notation used for the equations is not the same, and it varies between different equations.\" Here, the part is \"equations\" (so grounded enough to know where to look), and the issue is notation inconsistency. That\\'s specific. \\n\\nIn our case, the part is \"experimental procedures and evaluations,\" which is a section, so maybe that\\'s enough for Weak Grounding (since it\\'s a section but not more specific). The issue is that they are unclear. But the problem is that the reviewer doesn\\'t specify what\\'s unclear. So the specificity is not there. \\n\\nWait, the Specificity part requires that the comment details what\\'s wrong. Here, the problem is that the procedures and evaluations are hard to follow. That\\'s a bit vague. The authors know the area but not the exact problem. So maybe it\\'s Weakly Grounded and Not Specific (score 2). \\n\\nAlternatively, the comment does specify the part (experimental procedures and evaluations) so maybe the Grounding is okay, but the Specificity is lacking. \\n\\nWait, the Grounding is about identifying the part. Since the reviewer mentions \"experimental procedures and evaluations,\" that\\'s a specific part of the paper (the Methods and Results sections), so the authors can pinpoint that. So Grounding is Full? Then Specificity is Under-Specific because it says the procedures are unclear but doesn\\'t say what\\'s wrong with them. \\n\\nWait, the example for Fully Grounded and Under-Specific (score 4) is \"In Figure 7, the results and supplemental video results show that SurfGAN seems out of place.\" The grounding is full because it mentions Figure 7, but the specificity is under because it doesn\\'t say what exactly is wrong with Figure 7. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer is pointing to the experimental procedures and evaluations (so a section), so that\\'s fully grounded. The comment is \"extremely hard to follow... trouble following the exact experimental procedures and evaluations.\" So the issue is that the procedures are unclear. The specificity here is that the problem is lack of clarity in those procedures. But does that count as specific? \\n\\nThe Specificity requires that the comment details what is wrong. Saying \"unclear\" is a bit vague. The authors might need to know if it\\'s missing steps, jargon, lack of details, etc. Since the reviewer doesn\\'t specify, it\\'s under-specific. \\n\\nTherefore, this would be Fully Grounded (since they point to the experimental procedures and evaluations sections) and Under-Specific (because they don\\'t detail what\\'s wrong']\n",

The reviewer explicitly mentions \"section 2\" and quotes a specific sentence from there. That makes it easy for the authors to find exactly where the comment is referring to. So, the grounding here is strong because it\\'s pointing to a specific section and even a specific sentence. That would be \"full grounding\" according to the scale.\\n\\nNow, looking at specificity. The reviewer is critiquing the claim that this per-instance operation is an advantage. They argue it\\'s a drawback because such a model is \"almost useless\" for handling single time series.

The comment mentions \"Table 1\", \"the model\", and \"the experiments\". Table 1 is explicitly referenced, so that\\'s a strong point for grounding. The model and experiments are also mentioned, but they are general terms.

The reviewer suggests using a more convincing setting similar to a paper by He et al. from EMNLP 2018, which samples unlabeled data directly from millions of reviews.\\n\\nFirst, I need to determine the grounding. The comment specifically refers to the \"unlabeled data (2000) from the preprocessed Amazon review dataset (Blitzer version)\". That\\'s a very specific dataset and mentions the exact number of samples (2000). The Blitzer version is a known dataset in cross-domain sentiment classification, so the authors would know exactly which part of their work this refers to. The mention of He et al.\\'s paper adds context but doesn\\'t ground it further in the current paper\\'s sections.

The reviewer is telling the authors to modify their experimental setup to use a more realistic data distribution, which is a specific instruction. \\n\\nSo, the comment is fully grounded because it references a specific dataset and the issue with its setup.

The reviewer is pointing out that Equation 3 removes the modal subset for all instances, but in reality, different instances might have different strong modalities (A or B). The problem is that the equation doesn\\'t account for this variability. The reviewer is asking how the authors deal with this issue. The comment explains the problem clearly: the equation\\'s approach might not work because modalities vary per instance. The reviewer is suggesting that the method in Equation 3 doesn\\'t handle this scenario, so the authors need to address how their approach can account for varying modalities across instances. \\n\\nIs the Specificity there?

By reviewing your code and the details in the article, I can see that your workload is immense, however, the contribution of this paper is incremental. My understanding is that it is essentially a combination of GraphRAG and GraphCare [1]. Furthermore, many key baselines were not cited. Since the authors mentioned that this paper focuses on RAG for EHR, some essential RAG algorithms should have been introduced, such as MedRetriever [2], and commonly used GraphRAG algorithms like KGRAG [3].\"\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s check the grounding. The reviewer mentions \"the details in the article\" and refers to the combination of specific works (GraphRAG and GraphCare [1]), as well as the lack of citations to MedRetriever [2] and KGRAG [3]. They also mention the focus on RAG for EHR. \\n\\nSo, the authors can probably identify the parts where they discuss related work, contributions, and the methodology section where they describe their approach\\'s components. The mention of specific references (like [1], [2], [3]) gives some clues. However, the reviewer doesn\\'t point to a specific section (like Section 2 or 3) where these points are discussed. The authors might need to look through the related work and contribution sections to see where these points are addressed. \\n\\nNow, for specificity. The reviewer points out that the contribution is incremental and a combination of existing works. They also specify that key baselines (MedRetriever and KGRAG) are missing. The suggestion is to include these in the related work or baselines. The reviewer explains that since the paper is about RAG for EHR, those specific algorithms are relevant. \\n\\nThe specificity here is decent because the reviewer names the missing baselines and explains why they should be included. However, the comment on the contribution being incremental is a bit vague. The authors know they need to address the incremental nature but might need to infer where exactly in the paper this is discussed (probably the contributions section). \\n\\nPutting it together: The grounding is weak because while references to specific works are given, the exact sections in the paper aren\\'t mentioned. The authors can figure it out but might not be 100% certain. The specificity is good because the reviewer clearly states what\\'s missing (specific baselines) and why. \\n\\nWait, but the Grounding Specificity scale says that grounding is more important than specificity. Since the reviewer mentions specific references and the focus area (RAG for EHR), the authors can likely locate the relevant sections (related work, contributions, methodology). So maybe the grounding is actually full? Let me check the examples again. \\n\\nLooking at the scale, \"Fully Grounded\" requires explicit mentions of sections, tables, figures, or unique elements. Here, the unique elements are the specific references and the focus area.

The mention of MedRetriever and KGRAG as missing baselines points to the related work or experiments sections. \\n\\nHmm, maybe it\\'s fully grounded because the unique aspects (specific works and the EHR focus) are mentioned, making it clear where the authors should look. The specificity is there because they name the missing baselines and explain the issue with the contribution. \\n\\nWait, but the first part about the contribution being incremental is a bit vague. The authors might need to look at the contributions section but the reviewer didn\\'t explicitly say \"in the contributions section, the novelty is not clear\".

Here, \"sequential ensembling\" might be analogous to the UFE-layer, a specific component.

Specificity is about how clearly it explains the issue or what\\'s missing.\\n\\nStarting with Grounding: The comment explicitly mentions \"Figure 5,\" so that\\'s a clear reference. The authors can immediately know the figure in question. The discussion is about the comparison between the baseline and the time-aware model in that figure. So, the grounding here is strong because Figure 5 is directly named. \\n\\nNow, Specificity: The comment points out that when the time-steps are the same, the performance is similar, which questions the method\\'s effectiveness. It suggests that the proposed method might be better when time-steps differ. The reviewer is pointing out that the current results in Figure 5 under same time-step don\\'t show an advantage, so the authors need to address this by possibly testing different scenarios. The specificity here is good because it explains why the figure\\'s results are problematic and suggests a direction for improvement (testing different time-steps). \\n\\nWait, but does it specify exactly what needs to be done in the paper? The reviewer is saying that the current Figure 5\\'s results when time-steps are same are not showing effectiveness, so maybe the authors should include experiments where time-steps differ. That\\'s a specific suggestion. The comment clearly identifies the issue in Figure 5 and suggests a specific experiment to validate the method\\'s effectiveness. \\n\\nSo, Grounding is full because Figure 5 is mentioned. Specificity is there because the problem is explained (similar performance in same time-step) and a solution is suggested (test different time-steps). \\n\\nLooking at the scale: \\n\\n5 is Fully Grounded and Specific. \\n\\nThe examples given for 5 include mentioning a figure and explaining the issue in detail, which matches here. The comment is pointing to Figure 5 and explaining the problem with the current results and suggesting a scenario where the method might be better. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5. \\n\\nWait, but let me check the other options again. \\n\\nIs there any reason it might be under-specific? The comment does say \"maybe under some scenarios...\" but that\\'s part of the suggestion. The main issue is clearly stated regarding Figure 5\\'s results when time-steps are the same. The specificity is there because it\\'s pointing out the lack of effectiveness shown in the current setup and suggests a different setup. \\n\\nYes, so I think this is a 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly references **Figure 5**, providing full grounding by pinpointing the exact part of the paper under discussion. It clearly identifies the issue: the baseline and time-aware models show similar performance when trained and evaluated with the same time-step, which undermines the proposed method\\'s effectiveness. The reviewer further specifies that the proposed method might only be advantageous in scenarios where training and evaluation time-steps differ. This provides actionable guidance for the authors to address the gap by testing such scenarios. The combination of direct reference to Figure 5 and clear explanation of the problem and suggested improvements makes this comment **fully grounded and specific**.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5']\n",

The second part comments on the results in Table 5, pointing out that the improvement on OfficeHome dataset is only 64.71 vs 64.35, which is marginal.\\n\\nStarting with the first part: \"If Eq. 4 stands, does that mean the u^l in Eq.3 tends to 1?\" Here, the reviewer is referencing specific equations (Eq. 3 and Eq. 4).

The question here is whether this part is grounded. The comment mentions \"the update\" but doesn\\'t specify which section, equation, or part of the paper this refers to. The authors might have to guess which part of their work the reviewer is talking about.

The comment mentions \"experiments\" and \"baselines\" but doesn\\'t specify which sections or parts of the paper discuss these. The authors might know where experiments and baselines are described, but without explicit references like section numbers or figure/table mentions, it\\'s a bit vague. However, terms like \"baselines\" and \"experiments\" are common sections in papers, so maybe the grounding is weak. The part about societal impacts and limitations is a standard section, so that\\'s a bit more grounded, but still not specific to a section number or unique part. \\n\\nNow specificity. The reviewer points out several issues: baselines using position kernels without default settings, missing BO baselines, and lack of limitations/social impact discussion. These are specific points.

The societal impacts part is a common section, but the reviewer is pointing out that it\\'s not discussed enough. \\n\\nBut wait, the grounding is still weak because there\\'s no explicit reference to sections. The reviewer says \"the paper also needs to compare...\" but doesn\\'t say where in the paper that comparison should be made. The societal impacts part is a section, so maybe that\\'s a bit more grounded, but overall, the comment is addressing multiple areas without pointing to exact locations. \\n\\nSo, the grounding is weak because the reviewer doesn\\'t point to specific sections, figures, or tables. The specificity is there because the issues are clearly stated. So according to the scale, weakly grounded and specific would be a 3. \\n\\nWait, but the societal impact part is a standard section (like in many papers under \"Discussion\" or \"Conclusion\"), so maybe that\\'s a bit more grounded?

The specificity is there because the problem is clearly stated: the motivation is unclear due to the equivalence the reviewer points out. \\n\\nComparing to the scale, since it\\'s fully grounded and specific about the issue (the equivalence making the algorithm\\'s motivation unclear), this should be a 5. Wait, but let me double-check the examples. For instance, the example for 5 mentions \"experimentally demonstrated—and should be, because it is central...\" which is specific. Here, the reviewer is pointing out a specific reformulation and its implication on the algorithm\\'s motivation, which is detailed enough. \\n\\nHmm, but maybe the specificity is there. The reviewer is not just saying \"improve clarity\" but explaining the technical reason why the motivation is unclear. So yes, this is specific. Therefore, the score should be 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific). Wait, but let me check again. The comment says the prox-linear subproblem can be reformulated using conjugate function to become same as Algorithm 1\\'s subproblem. So the author can see Eq(1) and Algorithm 1, and the issue is about their equivalence. The reviewer is specific about the method (using conjugate function) and the problem (unclear motivation). So yes, this is fully grounded and specific. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the \"specificity\" part requires more? Like, does it need to say exactly what part of the motivation is unclear? The reviewer\\'s point is that because the subproblem is equivalent, the algorithm\\'s motivation (why it\\'s needed) is unclear. That\\'s specific enough. So I think it\\'s a 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly references **Eq.(1)** and **Algorithm 1**, providing **full grounding** as the authors can directly identify the parts of the paper being addressed. The specificity is clear: the reviewer argues that the prox-linear subproblem in Eq.(1) can be reformulated using the conjugate function to match the subproblem in Algorithm 1, thereby questioning the necessity or novelty of Algorithm 1. This critique directly identifies the technical flaw in the paper’s reasoning and explains *why* the motivation for Algorithm 1 is unclear. The specificity is strong because it provides a concrete mathematical reformulation and its implication on the algorithm’s justification.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reasoning:**  \\n- **Fully Grounded:** Explicit references to Eq.(1) and Algorithm 1 allow precise identification of the targeted sections.  \\n- **Specific:** The reviewer details the reformulation method (conjugate function) and explicitly states how it undermines the algorithm’s motivation. This provides clear guidance for the authors to address the issue.']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The comment says: \"7. FBN results (table 5): can authors please throw light on why the performance degrades when using the additional information about missing/wrong/redundant?\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate the Grounding Specificity. Let\\'s break it down into the two components: Grounding and Specificity.\\n\\nStarting with Grounding: The reviewer mentions \"FBN results (table 5)\". That\\'s a direct reference to Table 5 in the paper. The authors can easily locate Table 5, so the grounding here is strong. The comment is pointing to a specific part of the paper, so it\\'s fully grounded. \\n\\nNow, Specificity: The reviewer is asking the authors to explain why performance degrades when using additional information about missing, wrong, or redundant data. The issue is clearly about the degradation in performance in that specific table. The reviewer is pointing out a particular result and asking for an explanation of the cause. That\\'s pretty specific. They want the authors to analyze and discuss why adding that information leads to worse performance. \\n\\nWait, but does the comment specify what exactly is wrong or missing in Table 5? The reviewer isn\\'t pointing out an error in the table\\'s presentation but is asking for an explanation of the results presented there. However, the request for an explanation is still a specific direction for the authors to address. They need to provide more analysis in that section or table\\'s discussion. \\n\\nThe Grounding Specificity Scale says that even if it\\'s under-specific, as long as it\\'s fully grounded, it can still be a 4 if it\\'s missing specificity. But in this case, the specificity is there because the reviewer is asking for a specific action (explain the degradation). The comment is both grounded and specific. \\n\\nWait, let me check the examples again. For a 5, the example given is something like pointing to a part of the paper and explaining what\\'s wrong. Here, the reviewer is pointing to Table 5 and asking for an explanation of why the performance is worse, which is a specific request. \\n\\nSo Grounding is full because it references Table 5. Specificity is there because the reviewer wants an explanation for the degradation in performance when using that additional info. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5. But let me make sure. The Importance note says grounding is more important than specificity, but here both are present. \\n\\nAnother angle: The comment is fully grounded (Table 5) and specifies that the authors need to explain why the performance degrades in that scenario. That\\'s a clear direction. \\n\\nYes, so the score should be 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly refers to \"FBN results (Table 5),\" which allows the authors to immediately identify the specific part of the paper being addressed (full grounding). It also specifies the issue: the degradation in performance when using additional information about missing/wrong/redundant data. The reviewer is asking for an explanation of this result, which provides clear direction for the authors to address (specificity).

The reviewer argues that just minimizing this averaged loss doesn\\'t ensure flatness, so the authors need to provide analysis on the losses of the noise-injected models after training.\\n\\nFirst, check for grounding. The comment refers to \"Eq (3)\" explicitly, which is a specific part of the paper. The authors can pinpoint exactly where that equation is located. Additionally, the discussion about the base model\\'s loss and the noise-injected models likely relates to sections discussing the method, training process, or analysis sections. The mention of \"analysis on the losses...\" also points to where such analysis should be present but is missing. So, the grounding here is strong because of the equation reference and the context of the method\\'s analysis.\\n\\nNext, specificity. The reviewer clearly states what\\'s missing: an analysis of the flatness of the minima.

It also mentions a specific citation (PhaseNet-Das by Zhu et al. 2023), which is a unique element. However, it doesn't explicitly state the section number or page where the goal is discussed. But since the goal is a central part of the paper, authors can likely identify that section.

Section 3, first paragraph, in “It can often have faster convergence and better generalization than the SGD-based Algorithm 1, as will be demonstrated empirically in Section 4.1.” The “it” does not have a clear reference.\\n\\nSo the user presented two separate comments (numbered 2 and 3) under a single Review Point.

The comment says: \\n\\n\"For evaluation, since the claim of this paper is to reduce exposure bias, training a discriminator on generations from the learned model is needed to confirm if it is the case, in a way similar to Figure 1.

The reviewer is addressing the evaluation section of the paper, specifically related to the claim about reducing exposure bias. They mention Figure 1 and Figure 4, so that\\'s a good start for grounding. Let\\'s check the Grounding first.\\n\\nGrounding: The comment explicitly refers to \"evaluation\" and mentions \"Figure 1\" and \"Figure 4\". By pointing to specific figures and the evaluation section, the authors can likely pinpoint exactly where in the paper this comment applies. The mention of exposure bias as the paper\\'s claim also ties it to the main argument, so the authors know the context. The reviewer is suggesting a method similar to Figure 1 but different from Figure 4, which gives them specific references. So this seems fully grounded because the figures and sections are named.\\n\\nSpecificity: The reviewer is suggesting that the authors need to train a discriminator on the model\\'s generations to confirm the reduction of exposure bias, similar to Figure 1. They note that this is different from Figure 4 because the discriminator co-adapts with the generator, which might cause issues. This specifies the exact action needed (training a discriminator in a certain way), explains why it\\'s different from existing figures, and points out a potential problem (local optimum). The specificity here is clear: the authors need to perform this specific experiment and address the co-adaptation issue mentioned. \\n\\nWait, but does the reviewer clearly state what\\'s wrong with the current evaluation?

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user provided a bunch of examples with their scores and rationales, so I need to follow that pattern. The review point here is: \\n\\n* Although the style design is clean, the prompts are not well-organized (Table 6, 7). All sentences squeeze together.\\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate this based on the Grounding Specificity aspect. Let\\'s break it down.\\n\\nStarting with Grounding. The comment explicitly mentions Table 6 and 7. That\\'s a direct reference to specific parts of the paper. The authors can easily find those tables. So that\\'s full grounding. \\n\\nNow, Specificity. The reviewer says the prompts are not well-organized and that \"All sentences squeeze together.\" The first part, \"not well-organized,\" is a bit vague. But \"sentences squeeze together\" might imply that the text in the tables is cramped or not spaced properly. However, the reviewer doesn\\'t specify exactly what\\'s wrong beyond that. Are the sentences overlapping? Is there poor formatting like lack of line breaks or inadequate spacing between lines or cells? The reviewer could have been more explicit about the specific issue, like suggesting more spacing, adjusting margins, or rephrasing sentences for clarity. \\n\\nWait, but the mention of \"sentences squeeze together\" does give a bit more detail. It\\'s pointing out a layout or formatting issue where the text in the tables is too close together. That\\'s a specific problem, right? The authors can look at the tables and see if the text is cramped. However, maybe the reviewer could have provided more precise advice, like \"Increase line spacing in Table 6 and 7\" or \"Use bullet points instead of dense paragraphs in the table cells.\" \\n\\nHmm, the specificity part requires the comment to detail what is wrong. The reviewer says the prompts are not well-organized and the sentences are squished. That\\'s a bit more specific than just saying \"improve the tables.\" But is it enough? \\n\\nLooking at the examples given in the scale:\\n\\nFor a 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific), the examples mention exact issues like \"precise and define all variables\" or \"evaluate different types of self-supervised features.\" \\n\\nIn the case of the current review point, \"sentences squeeze together\" is a specific observation about formatting. So maybe it\\'s specific enough. But the first part \"prompts are not well-organized\" is a bit vague. However, combined with the second part, maybe it\\'s specific enough. \\n\\nWait, let me check the scale again. The key is that specificity is about clearly detailing what\\'s wrong. The reviewer here points out that in Tables 6 and 7, the prompts have sentences that are squished together. That\\'s a specific issue related to formatting within those tables. The authors can go to those tables and see the layout problem. The reviewer is pointing out the exact problem (sentences are too close, not spaced well), which is a specific issue. \\n\\nTherefore, this comment is both fully grounded (because of the table references) and specific (because it describes the problem as sentences being squished). \\n\\nWait, but in the example given for score 5, like the one about Table 2\\'s small differences making interpretation difficult, that\\'s also a specific issue. Similarly, here, \"sentences squeeze together\" is a specific formatting issue. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \"not well-organized\" is vague, but the second part is specific. Since the key is that the comment specifies what needs to be addressed, even if part is vague, the second part is specific enough. \\n\\nSo, putting this together: the grounding is full because of the tables mentioned. The specificity is there because the reviewer points out the sentences are squished. Therefore, it should be a 5? \\n\\nWait, but looking at the example where the user scored a 5 for \"Some items in Table 2 and Table 3 have Spaces between accuracy and standard deviation, and some items don\\'t, which affects beauty.\" That\\'s a formatting issue, and they scored it as 5. \\n\\nSimilarly, here, the reviewer is pointing out a formatting issue in the tables. So this should also be a 5. \\n\\nWait, but let me check another example. The user had a review point: \"In Figure 7, the results and supplemental video results show that SurfGAN seems out of place.\" That was a 4 (fully grounded but under-specific). The reason was that it didn\\'t specify what needed to be addressed. \\n\\nIn the current case, \"sentences squeeze together\" does specify the problem (formatting issue of cramped text). So maybe it\\'s more specific than that example. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that \"not well-organized\" is vague, but the second part is specific. Since the key is that the comment specifies what is wrong, the second part is specific enough. \\n\\nTherefore, I think this should be a 5. Wait, but let me check the user\\'s examples again. \\n\\nAnother example: \"The differences in results in Table 2 are very small, which makes the interpretation of results rather difficult.\" That\\'s a 5. Here, the reviewer is pointing out that the differences are small and hard to interpret. \\n\\nIn our case, the problem is that sentences in the tables are squished, making them hard to read. That\\'s a specific issue. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5. \\n\\nWait, but the user\\'s example where they scored 5 for \"Some items in Table 2 and Table 3 have Spaces between accuracy and standard deviation, and some items don\\'t, which affects beauty.\" The reviewer there specified that there\\'s inconsistent spacing, which is a specific formatting issue. \\n\\nIn our case, the problem is the sentences are \"squeeze together,\" which is a specific formatting issue.

Grounding refers to how well the comment points to a specific part of the paper. Specificity is about how clearly it explains the issue. The scale is from 1 to 5, with 1 being not grounded at all and 5 being fully grounded and specific.\\n\\nLooking at the review point, the reviewer mentions two specific instances of writing errors. The first is \"informative informative\" on page 5, which is a clear example of a typo or repetition. The second is \"performance\" on page 1 lacking a title. Wait, \"performance\" without a title might refer to a section or a figure/table caption missing a title. \\n\\nSo, for grounding: The reviewer specifies page numbers and exact phrases. The mention of page 5 and page 1 gives precise locations. The examples are literal mentions of errors in specific parts of the paper. That should be fully grounded because the authors can easily find those exact spots.\\n\\nNow for specificity: The comment points out the exact errors. \"Informative informative\" is a repetition, so the issue is clear—fix the typo. The second part says \"performance\" on page 1 lacks a title. Maybe there\\'s a section or a figure labeled \"performance\" without a proper title. The reviewer is specific about what\\'s wrong in each case. They tell the authors exactly where the errors are and what the problem is. \\n\\nSo, combining both aspects: The comment is fully grounded because it gives page numbers and exact text. It\\'s also specific because it explains the nature of each error. Therefore, according to the scale, this should be a 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific). \\n\\nWait, let me double-check the examples provided in the guidelines. For example, in the score 5 example, they mention a specific figure and explain the issue with it.

That\\'s strong grounding. \\n\\nNow, looking at specificity. The first part says the statement is only true for the standard sigmoid function [1+exp(-x)]^-1 and mentions dependence on max slope. The reviewer points out that the theorem could use more elaboration in the main text explaining why it holds, intuitively because the RNN converges to the nearest fixed point (FP) unlike the URNN. \\n\\nThe comment is specific because it explains exactly what\\'s missing: an intuitive explanation in the main text for why Theorem 4.1 holds.

The comment says: \"It appears that in nearly all experiments, the results are reported for a single held-out test set. Standard practice in most papers on GPs involves using a number of train/test splits or folds which give a more accurate illustration of the method’s performance.

The comment mentions \"experiments\" and \"results reported for a single held-out test set.\" It\\'s referring to the experimental section where they discuss their test sets. But does it specify which part? The reviewer doesn\\'t point to a particular section, table, or figure number. However, the mention of \"experiments\" and \"results\" would lead authors to the experiments or results sections. It\\'s a general reference, but maybe not explicit. Since they don\\'t mention a specific section number, figure, or table, it\\'s not fully grounded. But maybe it\\'s clear enough that authors can figure out which part to look at.

Hmm, so if the comment refers to \"experiments\" in a general way but it\\'s clear that the experiments section is where this is discussed, maybe that\\'s full grounding. Alternatively, if it\\'s too vague, it might be weak.\\n\\nNext, specificity. The comment points out that using a single test set is not standard and suggests using multiple splits or folds. It clearly states the issue (only one test set) and the recommendation (use multiple splits). That\\'s pretty specific. The reviewer is telling them to change their experimental setup by adding more splits, which is a clear direction.\\n\\nSo, grounding: The comment refers to the experiments and results, which are sections in the paper. Since it\\'s a common section, the authors can pinpoint the experiments/results sections. According to the scale, if it\\'s a general comment that implies the relevant parts without explicit naming, it can be full grounding. So maybe full grounding here. \\n\\nSpecificity: The problem is clearly stated (single test set vs. multiple splits), so that\\'s specific. \\n\\nPutting it together: If it\\'s fully grounded and specific, that\\'s a 5.

Another example is about Table 2\\'s results being unclear. The current comment doesn\\'t mention a specific section number or figure, but refers to the experiments in general. \\n\\nWait, the definition says \"Full Grounding: The author can accurately pinpoint the section, table, figure, or unique aspect being addressed.\" The comment here refers to the experiments, which is a section, so that\\'s a section mention. But is \"experiments\" considered a specific enough section? Like, the experiments section is a standard section, so the authors can go there. So maybe that\\'s full grounding. \\n\\nTherefore, since it\\'s grounded (they can pinpoint the experiments/results sections) and specific (they need to use multiple splits instead of a single test set), this would be a 5. \\n\\nWait, but looking at another example in category 4: \"In Figure 7, the results... show that SurfGAN seems out of place.\" That\\'s fully grounded but under-specific.

The specificity here is clear too: the reviewer wants the authors to rephrase the claim to avoid implying exact memorization, referencing a specific existing work (TopoNet).

The question is specific because it\\'s about the BPE vocabulary choice and its impact. \\n\\nNow, evaluating grounding: The first part refers to the comparison with Megatron and other models. The authors might know where that comparison is made, like in the results or related work section. But since it\\'s not explicitly pointing to a section, figure, or table, it\\'s weakly grounded. The second question is about the experimental setup, which is a specific section, so that\\'s fully grounded. \\n\\nSpecificity: The first part points out that the comparison is overrated because similar models have close performance, and the parameter efficiency claim applies to others too.

They explain that the histogram in Fig 3 shows GS-P-50 has a smaller class selectivity score, meaning it shares more features, while ResNet-50 has more class-specific features. The authors hypothesized that extra context reduces dependency, but the reviewer is asking why that implies better representation. They also cite two references.\\n\\nSpecificity-wise, the reviewer is pointing out a flaw in the reasoning from the data presented. They\\'re asking for the link between the observation (smaller scores) and the conclusion (better representation). The comment explains the current logic and questions its validity. So the issue is clearly stated: the authors need to better connect their data to their hypothesis. The references might suggest where to look for support, but the main point is the logical gap.\\n\\nSo, Grounding is full because lines and figure are mentioned. Specificity is there because the problem with the analysis is explained. The reviewer isn\\'t just saying \"this part is unclear\" but points to the specific reasoning step that\\'s missing. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific). The comment tells exactly where the issue is (lines 128-149, Fig 3) and what\\'s wrong with the analysis there.

The reviewer questions the logical connection between the observation (shared features due to context) and the conclusion (improved representation), urging the authors to clarify this reasoning.

They mention feature-replay methods in other works like R1, R2 (FRoST), and R3, which do well in similar areas.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check grounding. The reviewer points to a specific conclusion the paper made, quoting the exact sentence. That\\'s good because the authors can find exactly where that statement is in their paper. The mention of \"rehearsal-free continual learning\" and specific methods (feature-replay, FRoST, [R3]) also gives context.

The reviewer is saying the conclusion might not hold because the paper didn\\'t look at other methods like feature-replay. They provide examples of other works that use these methods successfully.

The comment has three parts:\\n\\n1. \"11 is wonderful, how about other bit operations?\" \\n   - The number \"11\" might refer to a figure, table, or section. Without context, it\\'s unclear, but maybe it\\'s Figure 11 or Section 11. The reviewer is asking about other bit operations beyond what\\'s discussed there.\\n\\n2. \"Fig. 5 a seems strange, please give more explanations.\"\\n   - This explicitly mentions Figure 5a. The reviewer wants more details or clarification on this figure.\\n\\n3. \"When the input is aer format, how did you deal with DVS input? If you can analyze the energy consumption as reference[15] did, this paper would be more solid.\"\\n   - Here, the reviewer is asking about handling DVS input when using the AER format. They also suggest analyzing energy consumption similar to reference [15].\\n\\nNow, applying the Grounding Specificity criteria:\\n\\n**Grounding:**\\n- The second part (Fig. 5a) is fully grounded because it directly references a specific figure. \\n- The first part (11) is ambiguous unless \"11\" is a well-known section/figure in the paper. Since the example might be unique to the paper, maybe it\\'s Section 11 or Figure 11. If the authors know their paper structure, they can locate it, so maybe weakly grounded? Or fully if \"11\" is obvious. But since it\\'s just \"11\" without context, it\\'s a bit unclear. \\n- The third part refers to handling DVS input in AER format. This could be in a specific section discussing input handling, but without a direct reference, it\\'s weakly grounded. \\n\\nOverall, parts of the comment are fully grounded (Fig.5a) and others are weakly grounded (\"11\" and DVS input handling). Since the grounding is mixed, but at least one part (Fig.5a) is fully grounded, maybe the overall grounding is weak to full. But the first part\\'s ambiguity might drag it down.\\n\\n**Specificity:**\\n- The first part asks about other bit operations, which is specific in asking for more analysis or discussion beyond what\\'s in \"11\".\\n- The second part asks for more explanations on Fig.5a, which is specific (needs clarification on that figure).\\n- The third part has two specific requests: explaining how DVS input was handled with AER format and analyzing energy consumption like ref [15]. These are clear and specific.\\n\\nThe specificity is good across all parts except maybe the first part\\'s \"how about other bit operations\" could be a bit vague, but it\\'s still a clear request to explore more operations.\\n\\n**Importance:** Grounding is more important. Since parts are fully grounded (Fig.5a) and others are weak, but the comment includes specific elements, perhaps the score is 4 (Fully Grounded and Under-Specific) or 5 (Fully and Specific). Wait, but the first part\\'s \"11\" is unclear. However, the figure mention is fully grounded. The other parts are weakly grounded but specific. \\n\\nWait, the scale says that if it\\'s fully grounded in some parts but others are weak, does that average out? The aspect requires that the entire comment\\'s grounding is considered. Since part of it is fully grounded (Fig.5a), but the other parts are weak, maybe the overall grounding is weak? Or does the presence of a fully grounded part elevate it? The definition says \"the authors can accurately pinpoint the section, table, figure...\" So if any part is fully grounded, but others are not, the overall grounding might still be considered weak because some parts aren\\'t grounded. Alternatively, if the majority is grounded, maybe it\\'s full. \\n\\nAlternatively, since the comment includes a fully grounded element (Fig.5a), the grounding is at least partially there. However, the other parts like \"11\" and the DVS handling are not as clear. The question is whether the comment as a whole is fully grounded. Since part of it is fully grounded, but other parts aren\\'t, perhaps the grounding is weak. Wait, the scale says \"Weakly Grounded and Specific\" is 3. But the presence of a fully grounded part might make the overall grounding \"full\" but with some under-specific parts. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the grounding is considered \"fully\" because some parts are fully grounded, but the rest are weak. However, the grounding score requires that the authors can identify the specific parts. For the parts that are fully grounded (Fig.5a), they can pinpoint that. For the other parts, like \"11\", they might have to guess, so overall, the grounding is mixed. \\n\\nThe scale says \"Weakly Grounded\" is when authors can\\'t confidently determine the part. Since some parts are fully grounded, but others are not, perhaps the overall grounding is weak. Alternatively, if the majority is weak but some are full, maybe it\\'s still weak. \\n\\nAlternatively, the first part\\'s \"11\" could be a figure or section number. If the paper has a section 11, then \"11\" refers to that, making it fully grounded. But without knowing the paper\\'s structure, \"11\" might be ambiguous. Since the user hasn\\'t provided the paper\\'s context, I have to assume that \"11\" is a standard reference (like a figure or section). So maybe \"11\" is a figure or section.

That's a strong point for grounding because the authors can directly locate Theorem 1. The other parts of the comment refer to the invertible function f* and the distribution P*.

The reviewer is asking for an intuition of the proof, which is tied to Theorem 1, and questions about how P* affects f* and practical determination of P*. \\n\\nNow, Specificity: The reviewer is asking for two things: an intuition of the proof and clarifications on the relationship between P* and f*, plus practical considerations for choosing P*. These are specific issues related to the theorem's explanation and application. The questions are clear and point to exactly what needs addressing. They want more explanation on the proof's intuition, an analysis of how certain P* distributions might simplify finding f*, and guidance on selecting P* in practice.\\n\\nPutting it together: The grounding is full because Theorem 1 is explicitly mentioned, and the elements f* and P* are part of that theorem.

      "[\"Okay, let's tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate its grounding specificity on a scale from 1 to 5 based on the provided criteria. \\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions. Grounding is about how well the comment points to a specific part of the paper. Specificity is about clearly explaining what's wrong or missing. The importance is more on grounding than specificity.\\n\\nLooking at the review point: The reviewer is talking about a risk in methods that exploit relationships between action units. They mention AU6 occurring in different expressions across datasets like SEMAINE and UNBC pain. They reference Figure 1 showing different co-occurrences of AU1 and AU12. The suggestion is to do cross-dataset experiments, which the paper lacks.\\n\\nSo, for grounding: The comment specifically mentions Figure 1 and refers to action units (AUs) like AU1, AU12, and AU6. The authors can look at Figure 1 and the parts discussing those AUs. That's a specific part of the paper. The mention of Figure 1 is explicit, so that's full grounding. \\n\\nNow, specificity: The reviewer points out that the co-occurrence differences are visible in Figure 1. They clearly state the issue (differences in correlations across datasets) and suggest cross-dataset experiments as a solution. The problem is specified as the lack of such experiments, and the reason is given (generalization testing). That's pretty clear. \\n\\nWait, but does it specify exactly where in the paper this is an issue? The comment is about the methods not testing generalization. The authors can infer that this relates to the methodology or experiments sections. The mention of Figure 1 grounds it, but the main critique is about the absence of cross-dataset experiments. Since the figure is explicitly named, that's fully grounded. The specificity is there because the reviewer explains the problem (different co-occurrences across datasets) and the needed fix (cross-dataset tests). \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5: Fully Grounded and Specific. The figure is mentioned, the specific AUs are noted, and the required change is clearly stated.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly references **Figure 1** and discusses specific action units (AU1, AU12, and AU6) to highlight discrepancies in co-occurrence patterns across datasets (e.g., SEMAINE vs. UNBC pain). This provides **full grounding** because the authors can directly locate Figure 1 and the sections discussing these action units. The specificity is strong: the reviewer identifies the **lack of cross-dataset experiments** as a critical gap and explains *why* this matters (differences in correlations across datasets undermine generalization). The suggestion to perform cross-dataset experiments is a clear, actionable recommendation.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reason:** The comment is **fully grounded** (explicit mention of Figure 1 and specific AUs) and **specific** (identifies the absence of cross-dataset experiments as a flaw and provides a solution).

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user provided two parts here. The first is asking to add more explanation about the experimental setting for continual learning. The second part is a detailed comment on Figure 3, asking for clarification on the relationship between learning curves and M-PHATE, and questions about accuracy numbers.\\n\\nStarting with the first point: \"Add a few more sentences explaining the experimental setting for continual learning.\" This is pretty straightforward. The reviewer is pointing out that the experimental setup for continual learning isn\\'t sufficiently detailed. The grounding here is about where in the paper this section is located. Since it\\'s about the experimental setting, the authors should know where that\\'s discussed, maybe in the Methods or Experiments section. However, the comment doesn\\'t explicitly mention a section name or a specific part like a table or figure. The authors might have to infer it\\'s in the experimental setup part, so it\\'s weakly grounded. The specificity is there because it tells them to add more sentences, but it\\'s a bit vague on exactly what details are missing. So maybe weakly grounded and specific? Or maybe fully grounded if the experimental setup is a standard section?\\n\\nWait, the definition says that grounding is about how well authors can identify the part. If it\\'s just \"experimental setting for continual learning,\" without pointing to a section, the authors might know where that is, but it\\'s not explicit. So maybe weakly grounded. The specificity is okay because it tells them to explain more, but not exactly what aspects. Hmm, maybe it\\'s weakly grounded and under-specific? Or maybe the \"experimental setting\" is a common section, so it\\'s fully grounded? I\\'m a bit confused here. Let me think again. The comment says \"add a few more sentences explaining the experimental setting for continual learning.\" The authors can figure out that this refers to wherever they described their experiments. Since it\\'s a standard section, maybe that\\'s considered fully grounded because it\\'s obvious. The specificity is there because it\\'s telling them to explain more, but the exact details needed aren\\'t specified. So maybe fully grounded and under-specific, which would be a 4.\\n\\nNow the second part: \"In Fig 3, explain the correspondence between the learning curves and M-PHATE. Why do you want me to want me to look at the learning curves? Does worse performing model always result in structural collapse? What is the accuracy number? For the last task? or average?\" \\n\\nThis part is about Figure 3. The mention of \"Fig 3\" makes this fully grounded. The specificity is high here. The reviewer is asking multiple specific questions: explaining the relationship between learning curves and M-PHATE, clarifying the purpose of the learning curves, questioning the correlation between performance and structural collapse, and asking for accuracy numbers (specifically for the last task or average). Each of these points provides clear guidance on what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this part is fully grounded and specific, which would be a 5.\\n\\nBut the review point combines both parts. The first part (about experimental settings) and the second part (about Figure 3). Since they are separate points, maybe they should be evaluated separately. However, the user presented them as a single review point. The instructions say to evaluate the review point as a whole. \\n\\nWait, looking back at the examples provided earlier, sometimes a review point has multiple parts, and each part is considered. For example, in the first example, the review point had two sentences, and the rationale addressed both. The score was based on the combined evaluation. \\n\\nSo here, the first part (experimental setting) is weakly grounded and under-specific, while the second part (Fig 3) is fully grounded and specific. How do we combine these? Since the aspect is about the review point as a whole, perhaps each part contributes to the overall score. But the scale is 1-5, so we need to assign a single score. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is weakly grounded (since it doesn\\'t specify a section) and under-specific, so a 3? Wait, the first part\\'s grounding: the experimental setting for continual learning. If the paper has an \"Experimental Setup\" section, then \"experimental setting\" is a standard section, so maybe that\\'s considered fully grounded. The comment says \"add a few more sentences explaining...\", so the authors can pinpoint that section. So that part would be fully grounded but under-specific (since it\\'s not clear what exactly needs to be explained). Thus, fully grounded and under-specific (score 4). \\n\\nThe second part is clearly fully grounded (Fig 3) and specific (multiple questions). So the second part is a 5. Since the review point includes both parts, the overall score might be a 4 or 5. But since the first part is a 4 and the second a 5, perhaps the higher of the two? Or average? The instructions don\\'t specify how to handle multiple parts. Looking at the examples, for instance, in the first example, the review point had two sentences but was scored as 4. The second part (about Figure 5) was fully grounded and under-specific (score 4).

The reviewer is pointing out that the comparison might be unfair because of different pre-training setups. They want the authors to clarify if other methods used similar pre-training. Also, in Table 1, the proposed method without SSL is worse, which might affect the fairness. The comment explains the issue clearly: the lack of same pre-training for compared methods. So the problem is specified well. The reviewer is asking for more details on how the compared methods were initialized, which is a clear direction for the authors to address. \\n\\nWait, but does it specify exactly what needs to be done? The reviewer is suggesting that the authors need to check if the other methods had the same pre-training, and if not, that might bias the results.

This specificity guides the authors to address how baselines were initialized and to ensure fair comparisons.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reasoning:**  \\n- **Full Grounding:** Direct references to \"experimental comparison\" and \"Table 1\" allow authors to pinpoint the relevant sections.  \\n- **Specificity:** The comment clearly explains the unfairness in the comparison and ties it to the data in Table 1, providing actionable feedback.']\n",

They\\'re pointing out that the method might be绕了弯路 instead of addressing the problem head-on. The comment specifies the issue with how the Witness oracle\\'s complexity is leveraged, so it\\'s clear about what\\'s wrong. The authors can understand they need to justify or reevaluate their use of the Witness oracle in that context.\\n\\nWait, but does it mention a section, figure, or table?

The importance is on grounding over specificity.\\n\\nStarting with grounding: The reviewer mentions \"fig.3-4\" explicitly. That\\'s a clear reference to specific figures in the paper. The authors can immediately go to those figures to see what the issue is. So that\\'s strong grounding. The comment is about the performance of a specific model (DNN+MMA) compared to vanilla DNN when lambda is small. The mention of lambda and the figures gives precise context. The authors can pinpoint exactly which part of the paper is being discussed because the figures are named and the parameter (lambda) is mentioned. So that\\'s full grounding.\\n\\nNow specificity: The reviewer is pointing out that the performance drop when lambda is small is unexpected. They explain their expectation that DNN+MMA should approach vanilla methods from above, but the figures show it\\'s coming from below.

The reviewer is specific about the parameter (lambda), the models compared (DNN+MMA vs vanilla DNN), and the expected vs observed behavior. They’re not just saying \"the figures are unclear,\" but explaining the discrepancy in the results. So the specificity is there because it details the issue with the results and the expectation.\\n\\nWait, but let me check the scale again. The options for fully grounded and specific (5) require that both parts are addressed. The comment does mention the figures (full grounding) and explains the problem with the results (specificity). The reviewer is not just pointing to the figures but explaining that the trend when lambda is small is unexpected. They’re pointing out a specific flaw in the results\\' interpretation. \\n\\nIs there any part that\\'s missing?

The reviewer mentions that the paper doesn\\'t compare with 2020 works but does compare with older ones like Taghipour and Ng (2016). The mention of specific references (Taghipour and Ng 2016) and the year 2020 gives some clues. The authors can probably find where those comparisons are made in their related work or results sections. However, the comment doesn\\'t explicitly point to a section or table where this omission occurs. The reviewer is referring to the absence of certain comparisons, so the authors might need to look through their comparison sections to see which 2020 works are missing. Since the reviewer gives an example of a compared work from 2016, that might help locate the relevant part. But the exact location (like a specific table or section) isn\\'t mentioned. So maybe it\\'s weakly grounded because the authors can infer the sections but can\\'t pinpoint exactly where.\\n\\nNext, specificity. The comment points out that the paper lacks comparisons with 2020 works and mentions that the authors defended this by saying those aren\\'t state-of-the-art. The reviewer also notes that they compared with older, worse systems. The specificity here is about the lack of comparison with certain works and the inconsistency in comparison choices. The reviewer is suggesting that the authors should either include those 2020 works or better justify excluding them. The comment is specific in pointing out the inconsistency but doesn\\'t detail exactly what needs to be done beyond adding those comparisons.

The mention of \"author response\" might be a typo and actually refer to the paper\\'s response, but in the context of the review, it\\'s about the paper\\'s content. The key is whether the grounding is enough.

However, without a direct reference to a section or table number, it\\'s still a bit vague. So maybe weakly grounded. The specificity is there because it explains the problem (inconsistent comparisons) and suggests including 2020 works. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the mention of Taghipour and Ng (2016) is enough to ground it to a specific part (like Table X where comparisons are listed), then maybe it\\'s fully grounded.

However, the reviewer does not explicitly reference a specific section, table, or figure in the paper where this omission occurs, leaving the authors to infer the relevant parts. The comment is specific in highlighting the inconsistency in comparison choices (excluding 2020 works but including older ones) and suggests that the authors should either include the 2020 works or better justify their exclusion.

The term \"multilingual chain-of-thought\" might be a specific part of the paper\\'s method or results, but without pointing to a section, figure, or table, the authors might have to guess which part is being referred to. The mention of \"villa chain-of-thought\" could be a baseline or prior work, but again, without a reference to a specific section or citation, it\\'s unclear. The comment doesn\\'t give line numbers, sections, or explicit references.

It points out that the improvement isn\\'t significant. However, it doesn\\'t explain what exactly is incremental—like specific features, experiments, or theoretical aspects. There\\'s no suggestion on how to enhance the contribution or what parts need more work. The reviewer just states the judgment without details. So the specificity is low because it doesn\\'t specify what\\'s incremental or how it could be improved.\\n\\nConsidering the importance of grounding over specificity, even if the comment had more specifics, the lack of grounding would still be an issue. Since there\\'s no explicit reference to a part of the paper, the authors might not know where to look. The comment is too vague about both the location and the nature of the issue. \\n\\nLooking at the scale: Not grounded (1) if there\\'s no reference at all. But \"multilingual chain-of-thought\" might be a unique term in the paper, so maybe it\\'s weakly grounded. Wait, the definition says weak grounding is when the author can make an educated guess but not precise. If \"multilingual chain-of-thought\" is a key part of the paper\\'s title or main contribution, the authors can guess it\\'s in the introduction or related work. But the comparison to \"villa chain-of-thought\" is unclear without a reference.

The comparison to \"villa chain-of-thought\" is vague without referencing prior work or a specific part of the paper where this baseline is addressed.

      "['Okay, let me tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the grounding specificity of this comment. The review point is: \\n\\n\"1. This paper (Section 4) examines G-effects of each unlearning objective independently and in isolation to other learning objectives. Results are also shown and discussed in separate figures and parts of the paper. Studying G-effect of each learning objective in isolation, raises the concern regarding the comparability of G-effect values across various unlearning objectives and approaches.\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the Grounding Specificity criteria. The key components are Grounding and Specificity. \\n\\nStarting with Grounding: The comment explicitly mentions Section 4, so that\\'s a strong point for grounding. It also refers to \"separate figures and parts of the paper,\" which gives more specific locations. The authors can definitely pinpoint Section 4 and the figures mentioned there. So that\\'s full grounding. \\n\\nNow Specificity: The issue raised is about studying G-effects in isolation leading to concerns about comparability of results across different unlearning objectives. The reviewer explains the problem clearly: when each objective is examined alone, it\\'s hard to compare their G-effect values. The comment specifies that the results are shown in separate figures and parts, which might contribute to the lack of comparability. The reviewer is pointing out that isolating the objectives might make the comparison across them less valid or harder to interpret. \\n\\nIs the specificity there? The reviewer is not just saying \"this part is unclear\" but is explaining the specific problem with the methodology (isolating variables) and the consequence (incomparable results). They also mention where this is done (Section 4 and figures). \\n\\nWait, but does the comment tell the authors exactly what to do to fix it? It\\'s more about pointing out an issue with the approach. The specificity here is in identifying the methodological flaw and its implications. The authors know that the problem is in how they presented and compared the results in Section 4 and the figures. They need to address how isolating the objectives affects comparability. \\n\\nSo, since it\\'s fully grounded (Section 4 and figures) and specific about the issue (isolating variables leading to comparability issues), this should be a 5. But wait, let me check the examples again. \\n\\nLooking at the scale:\\n\\n5 is Fully Grounded and Specific. The examples given include things like pointing to a specific part and explaining the problem clearly. \\n\\nThe review here does exactly that. It points to Section 4 and the figures, and explains that isolating the objectives causes comparability issues. The authors can go to Section 4, look at how they presented the results, and understand the need to address how the isolation affects comparisons. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5. But let me check if there\\'s any reason it might be lower. \\n\\nWait, maybe the comment doesn\\'t explicitly mention which figures? It says \"separate figures and parts of the paper,\" but doesn\\'t list specific figure numbers. However, the mention of Section 4 and that the results are in separate figures is enough for grounding. The authors can check all figures in Section 4 related to G-effects. \\n\\nSpecificity: The problem is clearly explained (isolation leading to comparability concerns), so the authors know they need to either present results in a way that allows comparison across objectives or address the limitations of their current approach. \\n\\nYes, so this should be a 5. But let me cross-verify with the examples given in the scale. \\n\\nFor example, one of the 5 examples is about Table 2\\'s small differences making interpretation difficult.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the grounding specificity of the given comment. The comment says: \"Advantage of UNIFORM over other procedures is not consistent. The tables show that UNIFORM does not always offer a clear advantage over the results, especially in the 1-shot setting. Do the authors have a theory for why the method is not as effective on the 1 shot setting? Clarity + Experiments are well designed, and the results are clear.\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to break down the components of grounding and specificity. \\n\\nStarting with grounding: The comment mentions \"tables\" which show that UNIFORM isn\\'t always better, especially in the 1-shot setting. The word \"tables\" is a specific element, so that\\'s a good start. The authors should be able to figure out which tables are being referred to, but it\\'s not explicitly stated which ones. However, since the tables are discussed in the context of the 1-shot setting, maybe the tables that present results for different settings, like Table 3 or something similar. The mention of the 1-shot setting gives a clue, so the authors can look for where their method\\'s performance in that specific scenario is presented. So the grounding here is strong because the reviewer points to the tables and the 1-shot setting. But since the exact table isn\\'t named, maybe it\\'s not fully grounded? Wait, the definition says \"literal mentions of sections, tables, figures\" or \"unique elements\". The mention of \"tables\" in general might not be enough. But the reviewer is pointing to a specific part of the paper where the results are presented in tables, especially regarding the 1-shot setting. So maybe it\\'s weakly grounded because it\\'s not pointing to a specific table number or section. Alternatively, if the tables in question are the main results tables that any author would know, maybe it\\'s fully grounded. Hmm, tricky.\\n\\nSpecificity: The reviewer is pointing out that the advantage isn\\'t consistent and specifically in the 1-shot setting. They also ask for a theory on why it\\'s less effective there. That\\'s pretty specific. The problem is identified (inconsistent advantage in 1-shot), and the request is for an explanation. The specificity is good because it tells the authors exactly what to address: explain why UNIFORM underperforms in 1-shot and possibly provide a theory. \\n\\nPutting it together: Grounding-wise, the reviewer refers to tables and the 1-shot setting, but doesn\\'t specify which table. So maybe weakly grounded? Or is the mention of \"tables\" enough? Since \"tables\" are part of the results, the authors can look at their results sections where they compare methods, especially in 1-shot. But without a specific table number, it\\'s not fully grounded. However, the mention of \"the tables\" might imply that the main comparison tables are the ones in question, so maybe it\\'s fully grounded because any author would know which tables show those results. Alternatively, if there are multiple tables, maybe it\\'s not. \\n\\nWait, the scale says \"Full Grounding: The author can accurately pinpoint the section, table, figure, or unique aspect being addressed.\" Since the reviewer mentions \"tables\" in general, but not a specific one, maybe it\\'s weakly grounded. Because they can\\'t be sure exactly which table, unless it\\'s a unique aspect like the 1-shot results. The unique aspect here is the 1-shot setting\\'s performance. So maybe the grounding is sufficient because the 1-shot setting is a specific part of the experiments. The authors can look at wherever they present 1-shot results, which is likely in a specific table. \\n\\nSo maybe it\\'s fully grounded because the 1-shot setting is a specific part of their experiments. The reviewer is pointing to the results in the tables related to the 1-shot scenario. Therefore, the authors can identify that part. \\n\\nSpecificity is definitely there because they explain the issue (inconsistent advantage in 1-shot) and ask for a theory. \\n\\nTherefore, if grounding is considered fully grounded (since it refers to a specific setting and tables), then this would be a 5. But if the lack of specific table number makes it weakly grounded, then it\\'s 3. \\n\\nWait the examples in the scale: For example, \"In Figure 7, the results...\" is fully grounded. Here, \"the tables\" without a number might not be as explicit. So maybe it\\'s weakly grounded. The reviewer could have said \"In Table 2, the results...\" but they didn\\'t. So it\\'s weakly grounded. \\n\\nTherefore, the comment is weakly grounded but specific. So score 3. \\n\\nWait, but the second part of the comment also says \"Clarity + Experiments are well designed, and the results are clear.\" That part is a positive note, but the main critique is about the advantage not being consistent. The positive part is separate, so focus on the critique. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the mention of tables and the 1-shot setting is enough for full grounding. Because the 1-shot results are a unique aspect. The reviewer is pointing to the part where they present the 1-shot results, which is likely a specific table. So authors can find that. \\n\\nHmm, this is a borderline case.

Grounding is about how clearly the comment points to a specific part of the paper. The reviewer mentions \"page 7 or discussion in page 8,\" which directly references sections. That should be considered fully grounded because the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is. \\n\\nNow, specificity: the comment is asking for existing linguistic theories that could explain why information value is a stronger predictor. It specifies the concept (\"information value as a stronger predictor\") and suggests a direction (linking to existing theories). The reviewer even mentions \"Complementarity in page 7\" as a possible location, which adds to the specificity. However, it\\'s not entirely clear if the authors need to reference a specific theory or just any relevant one. Still, the request is clear enough—connect their finding to existing theories. \\n\\nThe importance here is that the comment is grounded because of the page numbers, even if the specificity isn\\'t perfect.

Wait, the reviewer says \"if there\\'s any existing theory which could explain it\"—so they\\'re not pointing to a specific theory but asking the authors to find and reference one.

The authors know they need to find and cite a linguistic theory that explains why information value is a stronger predictor. The reviewer isn\\'t telling them which theory, just that they should check if one exists and add it. \\n\\nThis is a bit of a borderline case. The comment is grounded (specific pages) and tells them to link to existing theory. The specificity is there because it\\'s clear they need to connect their result to a theory, even if the exact theory isn\\'t specified. \\n\\nWait, the example in the scale for 5 includes a comment that mentions needing experimental demonstration of a claim. That\\'s similar here—asking for a theory to back up their finding. The specificity is in the direction (link to theory), even without naming one. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe under-specific because it\\'s not clear what exactly to do beyond \"find a theory if it exists.\" \\n\\nHmm. The scale says \"if external work is mentioned, it also evaluates whether specific examples are provided.\" Here, external work isn\\'t mentioned, just a request to look for it. \\n\\nGiven that the reviewer points to specific pages and the concept, and tells them to add a theory if it exists, I think it\\'s fully grounded and specific enough. The action is clear: check existing theories and include them if applicable. So maybe it\\'s a 5. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the lack of specific theory example makes it under-specific, then 4. \\n\\nThe example for 5 includes \"the paper presents the motivation... This is not experimentally demonstrated—and should be, because it is central...\" which is similar in structure: pointing to a section and suggesting a needed addition (experiment here, theory here). \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer is pointing to a section (pages 7/8) and saying they should add existing theory explanation. The specificity is there in the type of addition needed. \\n\\nTherefore, I think it\\'s a 5. But wait, the reviewer says \"if there any existing theory which could explain it. If so, adding that will make...\" So they are not sure if such a theory exists. The authors need to check.

Grounding is about how well the comment points to a specific part of the paper. Specificity is about clearly stating what\\'s wrong or missing there. The importance is on grounding over specificity.\\n\\nStarting with grounding: The comment mentions the \"primary contribution\" of the paper. That\\'s a key section usually found in the introduction or abstract. However, the comment doesn\\'t explicitly refer to a specific section like \"Section 3\" or \"the conclusion.\" The authors might infer it\\'s about the contribution section, but it\\'s not pinpointed. So maybe weak grounding? But wait, \"primary contribution\" is a standard part of the paper structure. Maybe it\\'s considered fully grounded because it\\'s a well-known section? Hmm, the definition says \"literal mentions of sections, tables, figures, etc.\" or \"unique elements.\" Since it\\'s referring to the primary contribution, which is a common section, perhaps it\\'s considered fully grounded because authors know where to look (like the contributions section). Alternatively, if it\\'s not explicitly named as a section, maybe weak? The examples in the scale for fully grounded include things like \"the methodology section\" or \"Table 4.\" Here, it\\'s not mentioning a section name but refers to the contribution itself. \\n\\nSpecificity: The comment says the contribution is only an incremental improvement and needs more evidence. That\\'s specific in terms of what\\'s wrong (incremental, not substantial) but does it specify what needs to be done? The reviewer is asking for more substantial evidence or arguments. So the specificity part is there because it tells the authors they need to provide more evidence or stronger arguments to justify the significance. \\n\\nPutting it together: If the grounding is considered fully grounded because it refers to the primary contribution (a standard section), then it would be fully grounded and specific (score 5). But if the grounding is weak because it doesn\\'t explicitly mention a section like \"Section X\" or a part of the paper, then it\\'s weakly grounded and specific (score 3). \\n\\nLooking at the examples given in the scale, for example, \"The paper discusses a hot topic... the analysis is poor\" is a 1 (not grounded). Another example for weakly grounded and specific is \"Some figures need their captions...\" which is 3. The example for fully grounded and specific is when they mention a specific section and what\\'s wrong. Here, \"primary contribution\" is a key part but not a section name. The comment is pointing to the contribution section, which is a standard part. Maybe the authors can pinpoint it to the contributions section, so it\\'s fully grounded. The specificity is there because it\\'s telling them to provide more evidence or arguments. So this would be 5. But wait, the example in the scale for 5 includes mentioning a specific part like \"in defining the UFE-layer...\" which is very specific. Here, it\\'s about the contribution as a whole. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the grounding is weak because it\\'s not explicitly pointing to a section. The authors might know the contribution is in the intro, but the comment doesn\\'t say \"in the introduction section\" or \"the contribution section.\" So maybe weakly grounded but specific. The comment is specific in what\\'s needed (more evidence), so that would be a 3. \\n\\nHmm, this is a bit of a borderline case. The key is whether \"primary contribution\" is considered a specific enough part. Since the contribution is a standard component of the paper, the authors would know exactly where to look. So I think it\\'s fully grounded. The specificity is there because the reviewer is asking for more evidence or arguments. Therefore, it\\'s fully grounded and specific, so score 5. But wait, the second part says \"More substantial evidence or arguments are needed...\" which is a specific request. So yes, that\\'s specific. Therefore, I think the score is 5. However, maybe the example in the scale for 5 includes more explicit references. Let me check the examples again. \\n\\nLooking at the example for 5: \"In defining the UFE-layer as graph-based aggregation...\" which is a very specific part. Another example mentions \"Table 2\" and the differences in results. The current review point doesn\\'t mention a table or figure but refers to the primary contribution. Since the contribution is a key part of the paper, maybe it\\'s considered fully grounded. So the score would be 5. Alternatively, if the comment had said \"In the abstract, the contribution...\" then it\\'s fully grounded, but without that, maybe it\\'s weak. \\n\\nAlternatively, since the contribution is a central part, it\\'s considered a unique element of the paper. The definition says \"unique elements of the paper\" can count as full grounding. The primary contribution is a unique element. Therefore, the grounding is full. The specificity is there. So the score is 5. \\n\\nWait, but another example in the weakly grounded and specific category is \"The notation used for the']\n",

Assuming S2D refers to a specific architecture or part of the paper (like a section, method, or figure), the authors should know where that\\'s discussed. However, \"S2D\" might be an abbreviation or term defined in the paper. If it\\'s clearly defined, then it\\'s grounded. The comment also refers to the number of parameters not changing, which likely relates to a part where the model\\'s parameters are discussed, maybe in a section explaining the S2D structure or in a table/figure showing model parameters. Since it specifically mentions \"parameters\" and \"kernel height/width\", this is probably in the method section or a results table. So the grounding here is likely strong because it\\'s pointing to a specific structure (S2D) and parameters. But does it reference a specific section, figure, or table? The comment doesn\\'t explicitly mention a section number, figure, or table. However, if \"S2D structure\" is a unique term in the paper, that\\'s enough for grounding. The authors should know where S2D is described. So maybe Full Grounding.\\n\\nNow Specificity: The reviewer is pointing out that the parameter count isn\\'t changing even when depth increases (since kernel dimensions are kept the same). They explain the expected outcome (more parameters) and note that the paper\\'s explanation is insufficient. The request is for more details on why parameters remain the same. The specificity here is good because it explains the issue clearly: the reviewer is confused about the parameter count not increasing when depth increases. They also mention FLOPs and efficiency, but the main point is about parameters needing more explanation. The specificity is clear in what needs to be addressed: the authors should clarify why parameters don\\'t increase despite the structural change.\\n\\nPutting it together: The comment is grounded because it refers to the S2D structure (assuming that\\'s a specific part of the paper) and the parameters. It\\'s specific in explaining the confusion and what needs to be addressed. Therefore, this should be a 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific). Wait, but does \"S2D structure\" count as explicit enough?

The examples for 5 include things like mentioning a figure and explaining the issue. Here, it\\'s a term (S2D) and the parameters.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. First, I need to evaluate the grounding and specificity based on the criteria provided.\\n\\nThe review point starts by mentioning that FedPCL\\'s performance relies on pre-trained model selection, which limits its applications. It refers to Table 4, showing accuracy sensitivity to these models. Then, it says the work addressed limitations by developing a lightweight framework and integrating pre-trained models for prototypes in federated aggregation. The last sentence mentions this is a new try for federated learning.\\n\\nStarting with grounding: The reviewer explicitly mentions \"Table 4,\" which is a specific part of the paper. The authors can pinpoint exactly which table is being discussed. So that\\'s full grounding on the part about the performance sensitivity. However, when talking about the solution (lightweight framework and integrating pre-trained models), the comment doesn\\'t specify where in the paper these solutions are discussed. But since the issue is tied to Table 4, which is part of the results, the authors can likely find the relevant sections (maybe methods or results). The mention of Table 4 gives strong grounding for the problem part. \\n\\nNow, specificity: The problem is clearly stated: reliance on pre-trained models and sensitivity shown in Table 4. The reviewer points out that the work addressed this by creating a lightweight framework and integrating pre-trained models. The comment specifies the issue (sensitivity in Table 4) and mentions the solutions implemented. However, the specificity of the critique might be under here. The reviewer says the work \"adequately addressed the limitations,\" but doesn\\'t specify if the solution is sufficient or what exactly needs improvement. The part about the solution\\'s specifics (like how the framework reduces costs or how prototypes are integrated) isn\\'t detailed. The comment is more of an acknowledgment that they addressed it but perhaps not pointing out what\\'s missing. Wait, the first part is a critique (reliance limits applications), and then the reviewer says the work addressed it. The main issue is the initial problem with the model\\'s reliance, which is well-grounded and specific. The second part is more of a positive note on their solution. \\n\\nWait, the review point is a bit mixed. The first sentence is a critique, then the reviewer acknowledges that the authors addressed the limitations. The part about the framework and integrating models is explaining how the authors addressed it. The reviewer\\'s actual critique is the initial part about the reliance on pre-trained models. The rest is the authors\\' solution. The reviewer is saying that the problem exists but the authors tried to fix it. \\n\\nSo for the critique part: The problem is well-grounded (Table 4) and specific (sensitivity to pre-trained models). The part about the solution\\'s effectiveness isn\\'t really a critique but an acknowledgment. The main critique is the initial issue, which is fully grounded and specific. \\n\\nTherefore, the comment is fully grounded (due to Table 4) and specific in pointing out the sensitivity and the dependency on pre-trained models. The solution part is more descriptive of what the authors did, not a critique needing improvement. \\n\\nThus, this should be a 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific) because the problem is clearly tied to Table 4 and specifies the exact issue (sensitivity to pre-trained models). The mention of the solution isn\\'t part of the critique needing improvement but rather the reviewer\\'s observation that the authors addressed it. The critique\\'s part is fully grounded and specific.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly references **Table 4**, allowing the authors to pinpoint the specific part of the paper being addressed (full grounding). It clearly identifies the issue: the sensitivity of model accuracy to pre-trained models and the limitation this imposes on broader applications (specificity). While the latter part of the comment acknowledges the authors\\' proposed solutions (lightweight framework and prototype integration), this is not framed as a critique but rather as a description of the work\\'s approach. The core critique (reliance on pre-trained models and sensitivity in Table 4) is both grounded and specific.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reasoning:**  \\n- **Full Grounding:** The mention of **Table 4** directly identifies the section of the paper under scrutiny.  \\n- **Specificity:** The comment clearly states the problem (sensitivity to pre-trained models) and its implications (limited applicability), providing actionable feedback for the authors to address.']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user provided a list of minor comments and suggestions, and I need to evaluate each part based on the grounding specificity aspect. \\n\\nStarting with part a: \"The main contributions are introducing two types of attention for deep VAEs, it might help to describe them in a separate section, and only then describe the generative and inference models. Right now the description of the layer-wise attention mechanism is scattered across sections 2.3 and 2.4.\"\\n\\nFirst, check grounding. The comment mentions sections 2.3 and 2.4, so the authors can pinpoint exactly where the issue is. That\\'s full grounding. Now specificity: The reviewer is pointing out that the attention mechanisms are scattered and suggests organizing them into a separate section before discussing the models. The problem (scattered description) and the solution (reorganizing into a separate section) are clearly stated. So specificity is there. So this part is fully grounded and specific, which is a 5.\\n\\nPart b: \"tricks like normalisation or feature scaling could be referenced in a separate section.\"\\n\\nGrounding here is weaker. The reviewer mentions \"tricks like normalization\" but doesn\\'t specify where in the paper these are discussed. The authors might have to search through the methods or experiments sections, but it\\'s not explicitly pointed out. However, the suggestion is to put them in a separate section, so maybe the current placement is unclear. The specificity is okay because it tells them to reference these tricks in a separate section. But since the exact location isn\\'t mentioned, grounding is weak. The comment is specific about what to do but not where. So weakly grounded but specific. That would be a 3.\\n\\nPart c is just \"c.\" without any content, so it\\'s irrelevant here.\\n\\nNow, since the aspect score is based on each part, but the user probably wants an overall score for the entire review point. However, looking at the examples given earlier, each part of a multi-part comment is evaluated separately. Since the user\\'s instruction says \"Review Point\" here includes a and b, I need to consider each part\\'s score and maybe average or take the lowest? Wait, the examples given in the problem statement had each review point as a single point. But here, the review point includes a and b as separate items. \\n\\nThe user\\'s previous examples sometimes had multiple points in a single bullet but evaluated each part. However, in this case, the user might expect each part (a and b) to be scored individually, but the question is to evaluate the entire Review Point. Alternatively, since the user\\'s instructions say \"Evaluate the review point based on the aspect description provided next,\" perhaps each part of the review point (a and b) should be considered as separate points, but since they\\'re presented under the same Review Point, maybe the overall score is an average? Or the worst score? Hmm, the examples given in the problem statement didn\\'t have such multi-part points, so maybe the user expects each part to be considered individually. However, the user\\'s input here is the entire Review Point which includes a and b. \\n\\nAlternatively, since the user included \"Review Point:\" followed by the content, which includes a and b, perhaps the entire Review Point should be evaluated as a whole. Let me check the examples again. For instance, the Review Point with \"3.In the ablation experiment...\" was considered as a single point and scored 5. Similarly, another example had multiple sentences but was considered as one point. So here, the Review Point includes parts a and b. So I need to evaluate each part and then determine the overall score. \\n\\nLooking at part a: 5, part b:3. The overall Review Point would have parts with different scores. The question is, how to combine them? Since the aspect is about each comment\\'s grounding and specificity, maybe each part is a separate comment. But the user might want the overall score for the entire Review Point. Since the aspect is per review point, perhaps each part is considered a separate review point. But the user presented them under one Review Point. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the entire Review Point is considered as a single point, so we have to choose the lower score between the two parts? Or average? \\n\\nAlternatively, since part a is a 5 and part b is a 3, the Review Point as a whole would have parts that are both fully grounded and specific (part a) and weakly grounded and specific (part b). Since the aspect is about maximizing the utilization, maybe the overall score is the minimum of the two? Or perhaps the score is the average. But according to the instructions, the score is per review point. Since the user provided the Review Point as a single point with subpoints, perhaps each subpoint is a separate review point. But given the way the user presented the previous examples, each bullet point was a separate review point. Here, the user\\'s input is a Review Point with subpoints a and b. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire Review Point is considered as one, and the score is based on the weakest part. Since part a is 5 and part b is 3, then the overall score would be 3? Or maybe the score is the lowest between them? Or since part a is better, but part b is worse, the overall is 3. Alternatively, the reviewer might have intended to give a score for each subpoint, but the user wants the entire Review Point\\'s score. Since the aspect is about the review point\\'s effectiveness, perhaps the overall score is the lowest of the two? Because if part b is weak, that part is less helpful. But maybe the reviewer expects each part to be evaluated separately. \\n\\nWait, looking back at the problem\\'s examples, for instance, the Review Point with \"3) The description of HIERENC...\" was scored 5. Another example had \"Table 4 needs...\" which was a single point. The current case here is a Review Point with two parts. Since the user\\'s instruction says \"Evaluate the review point based on the aspect description provided next,\" each part (a and b) is part of the same review point, so perhaps the overall score is the average. But the scale is 1-5. Alternatively, the worst score among them. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the Review Point as a whole is considered, so the presence of part a (which is a 5) and part b (3) would mean that the Review Point has parts that are fully grounded and specific, and others that are weaker. Since the aspect is about how well the entire review point helps authors, maybe the overall score is the average. But the examples don\\'t show such cases. Alternatively, since part a is fully grounded and specific, and part b is weakly grounded and specific, the overall score would be 4? Because part a is 5 and part b is 3.

The importance is more on grounding than specificity.\\n\\nLooking at the review point, there are a few parts here. The first part says the paper is well-organized and writing is good, but then moves into weaknesses. The main feedback is about improving writing by adding a table comparing CoT prompting methods, questioning an assumption about frequent-error clusters, and the selection criteria in section 4.2 regarding token and reasoning step limits.\\n\\nStarting with Grounding. The reviewer mentions \"section 4.2\" explicitly, so that\\'s a strong point for grounding. The part about the assumption (\"questions of all the wrong demonstrations fall into the same frequent-error cluster\") might be in the methodology or analysis section, but the exact section isn\\'t named. However, since section 4.2 is mentioned, the authors can definitely locate that part. The suggestion about creating a table isn\\'t tied to a specific section, but the question about the assumption might be in a different section. But since section 4.2 is there, that\\'s a fully grounded part. \\n\\nSpecificity: The request for a table comparing methods across dimensions is specific. The question about the assumption is also specific, pointing out the reasoning behind the assumption. The critique of the selection criteria in section 4.2 is specific because it asks why they didn\\'t choose questions with more than 60 tokens and rationales with over 5 steps. So those parts are specific. The part about the assumption\\'s basis is a bit less specific in terms of where it\\'s located but still clear in what\\'s being questioned.\\n\\nWait, but the first part about the table isn\\'t tied to a section. The reviewer is suggesting adding a table, which might be in a results or methodology section, but since they don\\'t specify where, that part is weakly grounded. However, since the rest of the comment refers to section 4.2 and the assumption (which might be in another section but the assumption\\'s mention is clear), the overall grounding is mixed. But since section 4.2 is explicitly mentioned, that part is fully grounded. The other parts (the table and the assumption) aren\\'t as grounded.

The assumption part\\'s location isn\\'t specified, but the authors might infer it\\'s in the methodology or analysis. \\n\\nSpecificity-wise, the questions are clear. The reviewer wants a table, challenges an assumption, and questions selection criteria.

However, since section 4.2 is explicitly mentioned, and the other parts are specific in their critique even if not fully grounded, the overall grounding is at least fully grounded for part of it. The specificity is clear. \\n\\nWait, but the Grounding Specificity scale requires that the entire comment\\'s score is based on whether it\\'s fully grounded and specific. Since part of the comment is fully grounded (section 4.2) and others are weakly grounded (the assumption part\\'s location isn\\'t specified), but the reviewer does refer to section 4.2, which is fully grounded.

The key is whether the authors can pinpoint the referenced parts. Since section 4.2 is there, that part is fully grounded, and the other parts (the table and assumption) might be in other sections but the questions are specific. \\n\\nAlternatively, the part about the assumption might be in the same section (4.2) or another, but without being specified, so that part is weakly grounded.

The issue raised is that these sections don\\'t explain the results are for unsupervised random forests, which is an important detail. The omission could lead to wrong conclusions by casual readers.

These are specific aspects that need improvement. The reviewer isn\\'t vague here; they\\'re pointing out the exact shortcomings. \\n\\nComparing to the scale examples, like the one in category 5 where they mention a specific section and detail the problem. Here, mentioning the literature review section and specifying the need for better comparative analysis and clarity on contribution seems to fit \"fully grounded and specific\". \\n\\nWait, but let me check the examples again. For instance, the example for 5 says something like \"In defining the UFE-layer...\" which is very specific. Here, the comment is about the literature review section and mentions specific aspects (main contribution, differentiation from existing work, especially GFlowNet). Since the literature review is a section, that\\'s full grounding, and the specifics of what\\'s wrong (lack of clarity in contribution and comparative analysis) are clear. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s \"fully grounded and under-specific\"? Wait, no. Because the reviewer is pointing out exactly what\\'s wrong in that section. The problem isn\\'t that the section is unclear in general, but specifically that it doesn\\'t make the contribution clear and doesn\\'t compare with existing work on GFlowNet.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the grounding specificity of the comment: \"The link between IP and the terms/equations could be explained more explicitly and prominently - Pls include labels for subfigures in Figs 3 and 4, and not just state in the captions.\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the grounding specificity criteria. Grounding refers to how well the comment points to a specific part of the paper. Specificity is about how clearly it explains what\\'s wrong or missing.\\n\\nStarting with grounding. The comment mentions two things: explaining the link between IP and terms/equations, and adding labels to subfigures in Figs 3 and 4. \\n\\nFor the first part about IP and equations: \"IP\" might be an acronym. If it\\'s defined in the paper, the authors know which part to look at. But the comment doesn\\'t specify which sections or equations are involved. The authors might have to search where IP is discussed in relation to equations, which could be a few places. So maybe weak grounding here because it\\'s not pointing to a specific section or equation number. But if \"IP\" is a central term, maybe it\\'s implied. Hmm.\\n\\nThe second part is clearer: \"include labels for subfigures in Figs 3 and 4.\" That\\'s explicit. Figs 3 and 4 are directly mentioned, so that\\'s fully grounded. So part of the comment is fully grounded, part is less so.\\n\\nNow specificity. The first part says the link should be explained more explicitly and prominently. That\\'s specific in telling what to do—explain the connection better. The second part says to include labels in the subfigures, not just captions. That\\'s very specific. So both parts are specific in their requests.\\n\\nBut since part of the comment (the IP part) isn\\'t fully grounded, does that bring the overall grounding down? The first part might be weakly grounded because it\\'s not pointing to a specific equation or section. The second part is fully grounded. Since the comment has two separate points, maybe we have to consider each part. But the scale requires the entire comment\\'s score. \\n\\nThe scale says that if part is fully grounded and part is weak, how does that average? The key is whether the comment as a whole is fully grounded. Since part of it (the figures) is fully grounded, but the other part (IP link) is not, maybe the overall grounding is weak? Or since one part is fully grounded, does that count as fully grounded overall?\\n\\nThe definition says \"the comment explicitly mentions which part of the paper it addresses, or it should be obvious to the authors.\" The figures are explicit, so that part is fully grounded. The IP part might require the authors to figure out where the link between IP and equations is discussed. If that\\'s a key part of the paper, maybe it\\'s obvious where to look. Alternatively, if it\\'s scattered, then weak. \\n\\nAssuming that the IP is a central concept, the authors might know where to look (like the theory section or equations in a particular section). So maybe the first part is weakly grounded but the second is fully. Since the comment has two parts, but the question is about the entire review point\\'s score. \\n\\nThe scale\\'s primary importance is grounding. The specificity is also present. \\n\\nLooking at the examples, for instance, in the example for category 5, they mention a specific table and give clear instructions. Here, the figure part is fully grounded and specific. The IP part is a bit less grounded but still specific. \\n\\nWait, the first part\\'s grounding: If the reviewer says \"the link between IP and the terms/equations could be explained more explicitly\", they might be referring to a section where IP is introduced or equations are presented. If the paper has a section on methodology or equations where IP is used, the authors can infer that. But without a specific section number or equation number, it\\'s weakly grounded. \\n\\nHowever, the second part is fully grounded (Figs 3 and 4). Since the comment combines both, maybe the overall grounding is weak because part of it isn\\'t fully grounded. But the figures part is fully grounded. The scale requires that the comment as a whole is evaluated. \\n\\nAlternatively, if part of the comment is fully grounded and the other is weak, perhaps the comment is considered weakly grounded overall? Or does the presence of fully grounded parts elevate it? \\n\\nLooking at the scale\\'s examples, for instance, in the category 5 example, they mention a specific table and give detailed instructions. Here, the figure part meets that, but the other part doesn\\'t. Since the comment has two separate issues, but one is fully grounded and specific, maybe the score is 5 for the figure part, but the IP part is 3. But the overall comment needs a single score. \\n\\nAlternatively, since part of the comment is fully grounded and specific (the figures part), and the other part is weakly grounded but specific, maybe the overall score is 4? Because the figures part is fully grounded but the instruction about the IP link is under-specific? Wait no, the IP part\\'s specificity is okay. \\n\\nWait, the specificity for the IP part is clear: explain the link more explicitly. That\\'s specific. The problem is the grounding. The IP part is weakly grounded (can\\'t pinpoint exactly where) but the figure part is fully grounded. \\n\\nThe scale\\'s categories are about the entire comment. So if part is fully grounded and part is weak, how does that work? The key is whether the comment as a whole is fully grounded.

Or does the presence of fully grounded parts make it fully grounded? \\n\\nLooking at the scale\\'s definition: \"Fully Grounded and Specific\" requires that the comment explicitly mentions the part or it\\'s obvious. The figures part is explicit. The IP part might be part of the theory or methodology, so maybe it\\'s obvious where that link is supposed to be explained. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer didn\\'t specify which equations or sections, then it\\'s weak. \\n\\nHmm.

The comment mentions \"approximations (i -iii)\" and refers to lines 107-110. The mention of specific lines (107-110) gives a clear location in the paper. The authors can go directly to those lines to find the part being discussed. The approximations i-iii are also specific, though the exact sections where these are introduced might be in the methods or theory part.

The reviewer mentions the \"Experimental section\" and specifically talks about results being close. The Experimental section is a specific part of the paper, so that\\'s good. But does it point to a particular subsection or table? The first part just says \"Experimental section,\" which is a whole section, but maybe the results they refer to are in a specific table or figure within that section. However, since it\\'s not explicitly mentioned, maybe it\\'s weakly grounded? Wait, but the reviewer is talking about the results in general in the Experimental section. Hmm. Wait, the first part is under \"Experimental section: a.\" So the reviewer is addressing the Experimental section, which is a specific section. The authors can identify that they need to look at their Experimental section. But the exact part where the results are reported (like a table or figure) isn\\'t specified. However, the mention of the Experimental section is a specific part. The grounding here might be \"full\" because the Experimental section is a specific section. But maybe the comment is referring to specific results within that section, but not pointing to a table or figure. Wait, the first part says \"Results are very close together\"—this is about the results presented in the Experimental section. Since the Experimental section is a specific section, but the exact part (like a table) isn\\'t named, maybe it\\'s weakly grounded? Or is the Experimental section considered \"full\" because it\\'s a section? The definition says \"literal mentions of sections, tables, figures, etc.\" So mentioning the section counts as full grounding. Therefore, part a is grounded in the Experimental section. \\n\\nNow specificity: The reviewer says they need to report averages over multiple runs because the results are too close. That\\'s a specific suggestion—they need to add averages, and the reason is that current results are close. So specificity is there. So part a would be fully grounded and specific.

Wait, maybe the \"Experimental section\" is the grounding, and the comment is specific (report averages). So that\\'s fully grounded and specific. But let me check the scale.

The reviewer is talking about the results being close, which might be in a table. Since they didn\\'t mention the table, maybe the grounding is weak? Hmm, maybe I need to think again. \\n\\nWait, the definition says \"full grounding\" can be achieved by mentioning a section. Since the reviewer mentions \"Experimental section,\" that\\'s a section, so that\\'s full grounding. The specificity is there because they say to report averages.

Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the Grounding Specificity criteria. The key points are whether the comment is grounded (points to specific parts of the paper) and specific (details the issue clearly). \\n\\nStarting with the first part: \"2.1.1. The paper claims that â\\x80\\x9cAnother distinction of our approach is the â\\x80\\x9cpickingâ\\x80\\x9d step â\\x80\\x9c. However, this aspect is not ablated.\" Here, the reviewer is pointing directly to a specific claim made in the paper about the \"picking\" step. The mention of the exact claim (\"Another distinction...\") shows that the reviewer is referencing a specific part of the text. Also, the comment is under the \"Ablations\" subsection, so the authors can pinpoint this to their ablation study section. The issue here is that the picking step isn\\'t ablated, which is a clear problem they need to address. That seems like full grounding because it\\'s tied to a specific claim and section, and it\\'s specific because it states exactly what\\'s missing.\\n\\nNext, \"2.2. Experiments on CIFAR. The comparison on CIFAR is not convincing.\" This refers to the experiments on CIFAR dataset. The section \"Experiments on CIFAR\" is explicitly mentioned, so the authors know exactly which part is being discussed. The problem is the lack of convincing comparisons. However, the first sentence here is a bit general, but the following points go into more detail.\\n\\nLooking at \"2.2.1. The continual learning literature has extensive experiments on this dataset and the paper only compares to one approach (DEN).\" Here, the reviewer is pointing out that the paper only compares to DEN, which is a specific method. The mention of the continual learning literature context adds clarity, but the key point is the limited comparison. This is grounded because it\\'s under the CIFAR experiments section and mentions the specific method (DEN). The issue is clear: not enough comparisons, so it\\'s specific.\\n\\nThen, \"2.2.2. It is unclear if DEN is correctly used/evaluated. It would have been more convincing if the authors used the same setup as in the DEN paper to make sure the comparison is fair/correct.\" This part is very specific. The reviewer is questioning the evaluation setup for DEN, suggesting using the same setup as the original DEN paper. The mention of the setup directly ties to the methodology in the experiments, so the authors can locate this in their experimental setup description. The problem is clearly stated: possible incorrect use/evaluation and the need for a fair comparison setup. This is both grounded and specific.\\n\\nPutting it all together: Each part of the comment is tied to specific sections (Ablations, Experiments on CIFAR) and subsections. The issues mentioned (lack of ablation for picking step, insufficient comparison methods, potential incorrect evaluation of DEN) are all clearly specified. The reviewer even provides a solution for the DEN issue, which adds to specificity. \\n\\nThe grounding here is full because each point references explicit sections or claims in the paper. The specificity is also high because each problem is clearly detailed. Even though some parts are under subsections, the structure of the review point mirrors the paper\\'s structure, making it easy for authors to find the relevant sections. There\\'s no ambiguity in what needs to be addressed. \\n\\nComparing to the scale, this fits into category 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific) because every part is explicitly tied to a section and the issues are clearly explained with examples.

There\\'s no under-specificity here because each point tells the authors exactly what\\'s wrong and sometimes how to fix it. \\n\\nI don\\'t see any part of this comment that\\'s weakly grounded or not specific. All elements are clearly anchored in the paper\\'s content and specify the problem areas. The only minor point might be if \"Ablations 2.1.1\" refers to a section number that the paper doesn\\'t use, but the mention of the \"picking\" step\\'s claim should still be enough for grounding. Since the reviewer structured it with section numbers, it\\'s even more precise. \\n\\nTherefore, the score should be 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review point is divided into specific sections of the paper (e.g., \"Ablations 2.1.1,\" \"Experiments on CIFAR 2.2,\" and subsections like \"2.2.1\" and \"2.2.2\"), explicitly referencing the structure of the paper. It directly cites the paper\\'s claim about the \"picking\" step and points out the lack of ablation for this specific component. For the CIFAR experiments, it identifies the limited comparison to only one method (DEN) and questions the validity of its evaluation, suggesting alignment with the original DEN setup. The issues are clearly articulated, and the reviewer provides actionable suggestions (e.g., \"use the same setup as in the DEN paper\").

The specificity is okay because it says they\\'re small and unreadable. So maybe category 3 (weakly grounded and specific) or 4 (fully grounded but under-specific)? Hmm, since it\\'s about figures in general, not a specific one, it\\'s weakly grounded. So category 3?\\n\\nSecond bullet: \"It doesn\\'t clearly state how equation 5 follows from equation 4.\" Here, the reviewer is pointing to equations 4 and 5. That\\'s explicit—equation numbers are specific. So this is fully grounded. The issue is about the derivation between the two equations. The specificity is good because it\\'s about the logical connection. So this should be category 5 (fully grounded and specific).\\n\\nThird bullet: \"It is not clear how θ^{t+1/2} come into the picture. Explain.\" The symbol θ^{t+1/2} is specific. The reviewer is asking for clarification on its introduction. Since the symbol is mentioned, the authors can find where it\\'s used. So grounding is full. The specificity is clear—they need to explain its role. So category 5 again.\\n\\nFourth bullet: \"S^{*} and S^{~} are very important parameters in the paper, yet they were not properly defined. In line 163 it is claimed that S^{~} is defined in Assumption 1, but one can see the definition is not proper, it is rather cyclic.\" This is very specific. The symbols are named, line 163 is cited, and Assumption 1 is mentioned. So the grounding is full because of the line number and symbols. The specificity is high as it points out the cyclic definition in Assumption 1. Definitely category 5 here.\\n\\nNow, each bullet has its own score. But the question is, how to evaluate the entire review point as a whole? Wait, the user might expect each bullet to be considered individually, but the instruction says \"evaluate the review point based on the aspect\". Since it\\'s a single review point with multiple comments, perhaps we need to evaluate each part and then decide the overall score. Alternatively, the entire point is considered as a single comment. Let me check the examples given in the problem statement. For instance, in the first example, the review point had multiple issues but was scored as 3. But in the problem, each bullet is part of the same review point. \\n\\nWait, looking back at the examples provided by the user, sometimes a review point has multiple sentences but is evaluated as a single score. For instance, the first example review point had three issues but was given a 3. So here, the four bullets are part of one review point. The score is determined by the overall grounding and specificity of the entire point. \\n\\nSo I need to assess each bullet\\'s grounding and specificity, then see the overall score. The highest score among the bullets would pull the overall up, but maybe the weakest part affects it. Alternatively, if all parts are high, the overall is high. Let\\'s see:\\n\\nFirst bullet: Weakly grounded (3) but specific. \\n\\nSecond, third, fourth: All are 5 (fully grounded and specific). \\n\\nThe first bullet is the only weak one. Since the Grounding Specificity score requires that the comment as a whole is evaluated, but the aspect is about maximizing the help to authors. The presence of some high-specificity parts might still make the overall score high. However, the first bullet\\'s grounding is weak, but the others are fully grounded. Since the reviewer is pointing out multiple issues, each with their own grounding and specificity, the overall score might be the highest among the parts. However, the scale requires evaluating the review point as a whole. \\n\\nWait, but the scoring is for the entire review point. Let me think again. The first bullet is about figures in general. The rest are very specific. Since the first bullet is part of the same review point, does it lower the overall score? \\n\\nThe Grounding Specificity scale says that the score is for the entire comment. For example, in the first example given in the problem, the review point had three issues and was scored as 3. So if any part of the review point is weakly grounded, but other parts are fully grounded, how to aggregate? \\n\\nAlternatively, each bullet is a separate comment? But the user presented them as one review point with four bullets. The instruction says \"evaluate the review point based on the aspect\", so the entire point is considered. \\n\\nIn this case, the first bullet is weakly grounded (category 3) but the other three are 5. The overall grounding is mixed. However, the Grounding Specificity scale is based on the comment\\'s grounding and specificity. Since part of the review point is fully grounded and specific (the equations and symbols), but another part (figures) is weakly grounded, how does that affect the total?\\n\\nThe problem says \"the review point\" is the entire thing. The score is for the entire review point. So, since part of the review point is weakly grounded (the figures part), but other parts are fully grounded and specific, the overall grounding is not fully grounded because one part is weak. However, the specificity of the entire point is high because most parts are specific. \\n\\nWait,']\n",

The first part about legends and axis labels is a bit more general, but the rest is explicit. Since the majority of the comment refers to exact sections (page 6, Fig 2 and 3), the grounding is strong. The authors can pinpoint exactly where the issues are.\\n\\nNow, **Specificity**: The comment details exactly what\\'s wrong. For the proposition, it\\'s about the formatting of the number (using (1) instead of 1, causing confusion with an equation). For the figures, it specifies that the font size in captions and legends should be larger, similar to the text size. These are clear issues with actionable fixes. The first part about legends and axis labels is a bit vague, but the rest provides clear instructions.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the comment is fully grounded because it references specific parts (page 6, Proposition 1, Figures 2 and 3).

Formatting of \"Proposition (1)\" to avoid confusion with Equation 1.  \\n2. Increasing font size in legends, axis labels, and captions in Figures 2 and 3 to match text size.  \\n\\nWhile the initial mention of \"legends and axis labels\" is slightly general, the remainder of the comment is fully grounded and highly specific.

It also cites a particular figure (Figure 2) from a reference [1], but that\\'s about the related work. The key here is whether the comment points to a specific section in the reviewed paper. The phrase \"counterfactual experiments\" might be a section or part of the experiments section. The authors should be able to locate where their counterfactual experiments are discussed, so that\\'s a strong indicator of grounding. The mention of Journey TRAK and comparing it to their own method\\'s CLIP cosine similarity suggests they are pointing to a specific part of the experiments where such comparisons are made or should be made. \\n\\nSpecificity: The reviewer is asking for a specific comparison against Journey TRAK at a particular step in the sampling trajectory. They reference Figure 2 from [1] to highlight that Journey TRAK shows a larger effect when removing high-scoring images compared to CLIP. The reviewer is pointing out that the current paper\\'s experiments don\\'t include this specific comparison, which they think is important. The comment specifies what\\'s missing (the comparison at a particular step) and provides an example from another work to illustrate the expected result. This gives the authors clear direction on what to add or adjust in their experiments.\\n\\nNow, considering the scale:\\n\\n- **Fully Grounded**: The comment refers to \"counterfactual experiments,\" which should be a specific section in the paper. The mention of comparing against Journey TRAK at a specific step in the sampling trajectory further narrows it down. Even without a section number, the term \"counterfactual experiments\" is likely a subsection in the experiments or results section. The authors can pinpoint that part.\\n\\n- **Specific**: The reviewer is not just saying \"compare more,\" but specifically wants a comparison against Journey TRAK at a particular step, referencing a figure from another work to show the expected outcome.

In Table-3, ACNN-v3 (all adaptive convolutions) performed worse that ACNN-v2 (adaptive convolutions only in the last layer).

The comment explicitly mentions \"Table-3\" and refers to specific models: ACNN-v3 and ACNN-v2. That\\'s a clear reference to a specific part of the paper (the table and the experimental results section discussing those models). So the authors can easily find which part is being addressed. That\\'s full grounding.\\n\\nNow for specificity. The reviewer points out that the placement of adaptive convolutions affects performance, based on the results in Table-3. They note that ACNN-v3 (all adaptive) did worse than ACNN-v2 (only last layer). The issue is the lack of analysis or comments on why placement matters. The comment specifies exactly what\\'s missing: an analysis of the placement\\'s impact.

The reviewer specifies that the authors should address why the placement matters (e.g., why ACNN-v3 performed worse than ACNN-v2) and adds that this analysis is missing.

The key points are Grounding (how specific the part of the paper is mentioned) and Specificity (how clear the issue is explained). The scale ranges from 1 (Not Grounded) to 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific). \\n\\nThe review point says: \"The proposed method reduces the computation time drastically compared to [10] but this is achieved by reducing the search space to the ancestral graphs.

How much information of a DAG is encoded in its corresponding ancestral graph?\"\\n\\nStarting with Grounding: The comment refers to the \"proposed method\" and mentions comparison with [10], which is a citation. It discusses the method\\'s approach of using ancestral graphs instead of DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) as in [10]. The authors can likely identify which sections discuss the proposed method\\'s computation time, search space reduction, and comparison with [10]. However, the comment doesn\\'t explicitly mention a specific section, figure, or table in the paper. The grounding here is weak because it\\'s referring to the method in general terms but not pointing to a specific part like a section number or figure. \\n\\nNow Specificity: The reviewer points out that reducing the search space to ancestral graphs leads to less information in the output compared to [10], which uses DAGs. They ask how much information of a DAG is encoded in the ancestral graph. This is specific because it clearly identifies the trade-off (computation time vs. information loss) and questions the extent of information retained. The reviewer is asking for an analysis or quantification of this trade-off. \\n\\nPutting it together: The comment is grounded because it refers to the proposed method and its comparison with a specific prior work [10], which should let the authors know where to look (the method section and comparison parts). But since it doesn\\'t point to a specific section or part of the paper (like \"Section 3.2\" or \"Figure 5\"), the grounding is weak. However, the specificity is there because the issue is clearly explained. \\n\\nLooking at the scale, Weakly Grounded and Specific is a 3. The example given in the 3 category includes comments like \"The notation used for the equations is not the same...\" which is similar here in that it\\'s pointing out a specific issue without exact location. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the mention of \"ACI\" (the method\\'s name) and the comparison with [10] could be considered as unique elements of the paper, which according to the definition under Full Grounding, can count. If \"ACI\" is the name of their method as presented in the paper, then mentioning it by name might be enough for full grounding. However, if the method\\'s details are spread across sections without a specific location given, maybe it\\'s still weak. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the paper\\'s method section clearly describes the use of ancestral graphs versus DAGs in comparison to [10], then the authors can pinpoint that section. Since the reviewer is referencing the method\\'s approach directly, maybe that\\'s enough for full grounding. \\n\\nHmm, the line is a bit blurry here. The comment does not mention a section number, table, or figure, but it does refer to a specific aspect of the method (search space reduction to ancestral graphs).

The reviewer is pointing out that this term isn\\'t clear. Since \"upper faces\" is a specific concept, the authors can probably find where it was introduced, maybe in the methodology or definitions section. The mention of \"dual subdivision and projection π\" also refers to specific terms that need better explanation.

The authors can identify where these terms are introduced or used. The mention of \"decision boundaries of neural networks\" gives a context (a section title perhaps) which helps locate the problem. So this is fully grounded because the reviewer points to exact terms and sections (even if not explicitly numbered, the terms are unique to the paper).\\n\\nSpecificity: The reviewer clearly states the issues: terms need better explanation and a variable is undefined. For \"upper faces\", they want clarification on the definition. For \"dual subdivision\" and \"projection π\", they need better explanations. For \\'p\\', it\\'s undefined and should be defined where it\\'s first used. These are all specific problems.

The issue here is that the reviewer is pointing out the lack of clarity in determining which component (shape model vs parsing model) is responsible for performance gains.

That's strong because the authors can directly go to that line. So grounding is likely full.\\n\\nNow, Specificity: The reviewer points out that the claim in line 104 is incorrect because RBF kernels have an infinite-dimensional RKHS, so neural networks can only represent finite-dimensional ones.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the Grounding Specificity of this comment. Let me start by recalling the criteria. Grounding Specificity has two parts: Grounding and Specificity. \\n\\nFirst, Grounding: How well does the comment point to a specific part of the paper? The comment mentions \"Fig. 4\" right away. That\\'s a strong indicator of grounding because it\\'s explicitly referencing a figure. The authors can go straight to Figure 4 to see what\\'s being discussed. So that\\'s full grounding. \\n\\nNow, Specificity: Does the comment clearly state what\\'s wrong or missing? The reviewer is asking two things here. First, they\\'re questioning whether adding noise to GPI could reproduce data as well, and if there are other measures (like behavioral trajectories or time to goal) to show that GPI can\\'t fit the behavioral data as well. Second, they suggest discussing the suitability of the approach for pattern separation tasks, especially since there\\'s behavioral data available. \\n\\nBreaking it down, the first part is asking for an analysis or additional experiments related to the current Figure 4. The second part is a suggestion to include a discussion on applying the model to another task. Both parts are specific in what they\\'re asking for. The reviewer isn\\'t just saying \"add more analysis\" but pointing to specific aspects like behavioral trajectories and time to goal. They also mention pattern separation tasks and existing behavioral data, which gives clear directions. \\n\\nWait, but let me check if there\\'s any ambiguity. The comment does ask a question: \"is it possible that GPI with noise added could reproduce the data similarly well...\" which is a bit open-ended, but the reviewer then provides examples of measures (behavioral trajectories, time to goal) that could address this. So the specificity is there because they\\'re suggesting specific measures to include. \\n\\nAlso, the second part about pattern separation tasks is a clear suggestion to add a discussion on that application. The authors know exactly where to look (Fig.4) and what to address (the limitations of GPI with noise and the potential application to pattern separation with existing data). \\n\\nSo putting it together, the grounding is full because of the figure reference. The specificity is there because the reviewer specifies the exact aspects to consider. Therefore, this should be a 5 (Fully Grounded and Specific). \\n\\nWait, but let me cross-verify with the scale examples. For a 5, the examples given are things like mentioning a specific section and explaining exactly what\\'s needed. Here, the figure is mentioned, and the reviewer points out specific measures and a discussion point.

It then raises two specific points:  \\n1. It questions whether adding noise to GPI could achieve similar data reproduction and asks for additional measures (e.g., behavioral trajectories, time to goal) to demonstrate GPI’s limitations.  \\n2. It suggests discussing the suitability of the approach for pattern separation tasks, given available behavioral data.  \\n\\nBoth points clearly specify what needs to be addressed (e.g., analyzing alternative measures, expanding the discussion on applications).

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The comment says, \"The performance gains are not very high, for most of the metrics the difference between the baseline (w/o caption + w/o warmup) and best approach (with caption + warmup) is less than 1%.\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the grounding and specificity here. Grounding refers to whether the reviewer clearly points to a specific part of the paper. The comment mentions \"most of the metrics\" and refers to specific baselines and approaches: the baseline is \"w/o caption + w/o warmup\" and the best approach is \"with caption + warmup.\" These terms are likely specific to the paper\\'s methodology or results sections. The author should be able to find where these baselines and approaches are discussed, probably in tables or figures comparing results. So the grounding here is probably full because the reviewer is referencing specific experimental setups mentioned in the paper.\\n\\nNow for specificity: the reviewer is pointing out that the performance gains are small (less than 1%) across most metrics. They\\'re indicating that the improvements aren\\'t significant. The comment is specific about what\\'s wrong—the small margin between the baseline and the best method. The authors know they need to address why the gains are minimal and perhaps discuss the implications or consider other metrics where the difference is more substantial. The reviewer isn\\'t just saying \"improve results\" but is highlighting a specific issue with the current results\\' margins. \\n\\nWait, but does the comment tell the authors exactly where in the paper to look? The mention of \"most of the metrics\" and the specific baseline vs. best approach names should point them to the results section where those comparisons are made, likely in a table. Since the terms are unique to the paper\\'s experimental setup, that\\'s full grounding. The specificity is there because the problem is clearly the small performance difference. The authors need to explain or address this in their analysis. \\n\\nSo putting it together: Full grounding because of the specific terms and the context of the experiments. Specificity is present because the issue is clearly the minimal gains. Therefore, this should be a 5? Wait, but let me check the scale again. \\n\\nLooking back at the scale, a 5 is \"Fully Grounded and Specific.\" The examples given for 5 include comments that both point to a specific part and detail the issue. Here, the reviewer is pointing to the results comparing those specific baselines and stating the problem is the small difference. That\\'s specific enough. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the specificity is under-specific? Wait, the comment says the difference is less than 1% but doesn\\'t say what should be done about it. Wait, the reviewer is pointing out an issue but not necessarily prescribing a solution. However, the aspect\\'s importance says grounding is more important than specificity. The question is, does the comment specify what\\'s wrong? The problem is that the gains are too small. That\\'s a clear issue. The authors know they need to address why the gains are minimal, perhaps by discussing limitations, suggesting further experiments, or contextualizing the results better. \\n\\nYes, so the specificity is there because the issue is clearly the small margin. So the score should be 5. Wait, but let me check the examples again. For instance, the example for 5 says something like \"In Table 2, the differences are very small, making interpretation difficult.\" That\\'s similar to this case. The reviewer here is pointing to the comparison between specific methods (baseline vs best) and states the problem with the metrics\\' differences. \\n\\nTherefore, I think this is a 5. But wait, maybe the reviewer didn\\'t mention a specific table or figure? They just refer to \"most of the metrics.\" If the paper has a table comparing these baselines, then the mention of \"baseline (w/o caption + w/o warmup)\" and \"best approach (with caption + warmup)\" would directly correspond to entries in that table, so the authors can find it. Since those terms are unique to the paper\\'s experiments, that\\'s full grounding. The specificity is present because they identify the issue as the small difference. \\n\\nSo the rationale would be: The comment is fully grounded as it explicitly refers to specific experimental setups (baseline and best approach) mentioned in the paper, allowing authors to identify the relevant results section or table. It specifies the issue by pointing out the minimal performance gains (less than 1%) across most metrics, indicating that the authors need to address the significance or implications of these results. Therefore, it\\'s fully grounded and specific, score 5.\\n</think>\\n\\nrationale: The comment explicitly refers to specific experimental setups (\"baseline (w/o caption + w/o warmup)\" and \"best approach (with caption + warmup)\"), which are likely detailed in a results table or section of the paper. This provides full grounding as authors can identify the exact comparison being discussed. The specificity is clear']\n",

The reviewer specifies exactly what changes to make (averaging over multiple runs) and names specific metrics (COMET/BLEURT) to add. The authors can directly implement these steps without ambiguity.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reason:** The comment is **explicit** (directly states the required actions) and **concrete** (provides specific metrics and methodology adjustments).

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The comment says: \"1) The paper does not dig into the theory profs and show the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm.\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate its actionability based on the criteria given. The aspect is about how helpful the comment is for authors to improve their draft. The two main criteria are explicit vs. implicit and concrete vs. vague.\\n\\nStarting with explicit vs. implicit. The reviewer is pointing out that the paper lacks theoretical proofs and convergence analysis. The action here is implicit because the reviewer isn\\'t directly telling the authors to add those sections. Instead, they\\'re stating a missing component. The authors would need to infer that they should include the theory and convergence proofs. \\n\\nNext, concrete vs. vague. The comment specifies that the paper doesn\\'t have \"theory profs\" (probably a typo for \"proofs\") and convergence properties. The action is to add these elements. However, the reviewer doesn\\'t explain how to present the proofs, which specific convergence properties to address, or any particular method to use for the analysis. So while the action is clear in terms of what\\'s missing, the \"how\" is not provided. The authors know they need to include theory and convergence but might not know exactly which aspects to focus on or how to structure it. \\n\\nConsidering the scale: Since the action is implicit but the need is clear (add theoretical proofs and convergence analysis), it\\'s somewhat actionable. The authors know what to do but might need to figure out the details themselves. It\\'s not vague in the sense that they know the general direction but lacks specifics on implementation. Comparing to the examples given for score 3 (somewhat actionable), which includes explicit actions but vague execution, this might be similar. However, since the action here is implicit, maybe it\\'s a 2? Wait, the examples for score 2 are things like \"I wonder what would happen if you used another dataset.\" The current comment is more direct in pointing out a missing component, so maybe it\\'s a 3? \\n\\nWait, the examples for score 3 are explicit actions but vague. For instance, \"You should address the lack of technical novelty...\" which is explicit but vague on how. In this case, the comment is implicit (since it\\'s pointing out a missing part without telling to add it directly), so perhaps it\\'s a 2? Because the action is inferred (add the theory and convergence), but the how is vague. The authors have to figure out what exactly to add. \\n\\nHmm, the definition for score 2 is borderline actionable: implicit action that can be inferred but the action itself is vague. Here, the action is to include the theory and convergence properties, which is a clear action (not vague), but the how is vague. Wait, maybe the action is explicit because the reviewer is saying \"the paper does not dig into...\" so the action is to do that. So maybe it\\'s explicit. Wait, the explicit vs implicit criteria: explicit is when the action is direct. The comment here is stating a deficiency, so the action is implied (you should add theory and convergence proofs). So it\\'s implicit. \\n\\nSo, implicit action (since it\\'s not a direct suggestion but pointing out a missing part) and the action (adding theory and convergence) is concrete in what needs to be done, but the how is vague. Wait, the concrete vs vague is about once the action is identified, do they know how to do it? If the action is \"add convergence proofs\", then the authors might know how to do that (they need to analyze their algorithm\\'s convergence), but the reviewer didn\\'t specify which aspects or methods. So the action is concrete in the sense of knowing what to do (add proofs), but the specifics (like which theorems, methods) are up to the authors. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the reviewer\\'s comment is too vague because they don\\'t specify what kind of theory or which convergence properties are needed. The authors might not know exactly which parts of the theory to include or how to structure the proofs. So the action is concrete in the sense of knowing to add theory, but the execution (how to do it) is vague. \\n\\nLooking at the scale: \\n\\nScore 3 is explicit action but vague execution. \\n\\nScore 4 is implicit but concrete. \\n\\nWait, the definition for 4 says: \"implicitly states an action but concretely states how to implement the inferred action.\" \\n\\nIn this case, the comment doesn\\'t give concrete steps on how to implement the action (e.g., \"include a proof of Theorem X using method Y\"), so it\\'s not concrete in the how. \\n\\nTherefore, the action is implicit and the execution is vague. That would be score 2 (borderline actionable). \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the action is explicit because the reviewer is directly pointing out that the paper lacks theory, so the action is explicit (you should include it). In that case, it\\'s explicit but vague on how. So that would be score 3. \\n\\nThe line between explicit and implicit here is a bit fuzzy. The original examples for explicit include things like \"You should address the lack of technical novelty.\" So in this case, the reviewer\\'s comment is similar: \"The paper does not dig into the theory...\" which is pointing out a missing component, so the action is to address that. So maybe that\\'s explicit? Because it\\'s telling the authors what is missing, so they can take action. \\n\\nIf it\\'s explicit but vague on how, then score 3. \\n\\nBut the examples for score 3 are like \"You should address the lack of technical novelty in this paper.\" Which is exactly like this case. The reviewer is pointing out a deficiency (lack of theory and convergence) and the action is to address that. So that\\'s explicit but vague on how. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 3. \\n\\nWait, but the reviewer here is more specific: they mention \"theory profs\" and \"convergence properties\". So the action is to include those specific things, which is more concrete. \\n\\nWait, \"theory proofs\" and \"convergence properties\" are specific elements. So the action is explicit (add proofs and convergence analysis) and the how is still vague, but the what is clear. \\n\\nSo according to the scale, explicit (since it\\'s a direct suggestion of what to add) but vague in execution (how to do it). So that\\'s score 3. \\n\\nYes, so the score would be 3. \\n\\nThe rationale would be that the reviewer explicitly points out the missing components (theory proofs and convergence properties), giving a clear direction for the authors to add those sections. However, the comment does not provide specific guidance on what kind of proofs to include, which theoretical aspects to focus on, or how to demonstrate convergence. The']\n",

The actionability criteria are about whether the comment gives explicit or implicit actions and if those are concrete or vague. \\n\\nThe reviewer is asking for the reason behind not considering certain operators. This is framed as a question, which according to the aspect description, if it gives a direct action, it\\'s explicit. But here, the question is more about understanding the authors\\' choices rather than a direct instruction. However, the implication is that the authors should address this in their draft, possibly by explaining their choice or considering those operators. \\n\\nThe action here would be for the authors to either justify their selection of operators or to include the \"and\" operator and element-wise max in their experiments and discuss the results. The reviewer is pointing out a gap in the current analysis by not considering these operators, so the implicit action is to address why those weren\\'t used or to add that analysis. \\n\\nNow, is the action explicit or implicit? Since the reviewer is asking a question, it\\'s more implicit. They are suggesting that the authors should consider these operators, but it\\'s not a direct command. The authors need to infer that they should either explain their choice or include those methods. \\n\\nNext, is the action concrete or vague? The specific operators are named (\"and\" operator, element-wise max), so the action is concrete. The authors know exactly which operators the reviewer is referring to and could test them or explain why they weren\\'t chosen. \\n\\nAccording to the scale, if the action is implicit but concrete, that would be a 4 (mostly actionable). However, if the action is explicit but vague, it\\'s a 3. Since the question is implicit but the required action (explain or test) is concrete, it should be a 4. \\n\\nWait, let me check the examples again. For instance, the example under 4 says \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y...\" which is implicit but concrete. Similarly, here, the reviewer is pointing out specific operators (like X and Y), so the action is to address their consideration. Hence, this aligns with a 4. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had said \"You should test the and operator...\", that would be explicit, but since it\\'s a question, it\\'s implicit.

They seem to correspond to the ideas of union and intersection from the or operator and element-wise min, and it wasn’t clear to me why the ones you chose were better options.  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer’s comment highlights a specific gap in the manuscript by questioning the omission of the \"and\" operator and element-wise max in lines 261 and 272. While phrased as a question, the implication is clear: the authors should either justify their choice of operators or address why the alternative operators (and, element-wise max) were not considered. The reviewer provides concrete examples of the operators in question and connects them to logical concepts (union/intersection), making the required action explicit in intent. The authors can infer that they need to either add experiments using these operators or explicitly explain their rationale for excluding them. The specificity of the operators and their potential relevance makes the action concrete, even though the suggestion is implicit.  \\n\\n**Score:** 4  \\n**Reasoning:**  \\n- **Implicit Action:** The reviewer does not explicitly state \"you should test these operators,\" but the question directly implies that the authors should address this gap.  \\n- **Concrete:** The specific operators (\"and,\" element-wise max) and their conceptual connections (union/intersection) provide clear guidance on how to proceed.  \\n- This aligns with the **Mostly Actionable (4)** category, as the action is inferred but the required steps (e.g., experimentation or explanation) are unambiguous.']\n",

So 4. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s a 3 because the action is explicit (the question implies they need to address it, so explicit?), but the how is vague. Wait, the question is phrased as a question, so it\\'s implicit. \\n\\nWait, the explicit vs implicit part: \"Explicit: Actions or suggestions that are direct or apparent.\" The question is a suggestion in the form of a question. The reviewer is suggesting that the authors need to clarify this scenario. So maybe it\\'s explicit because it\\'s a direct question prompting an action. \\n\\nIf it\\'s explicit, then looking at concrete vs vague. The action is to clarify how they handle non-pronoun heads. The reviewer hasn\\'t specified how, so the action is explicit but the implementation is vague. That would be a 3. \\n\\nBut the question is clear about what\\'s missing. The authors know exactly what to address. The vagueness is in how they should do it, but the problem is concrete. \\n\\nSo maybe 3. \\n\\nAlternatively, the example in the scale for 4 includes \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y...\" which is implicit but gives concrete examples. Here, the problem is concrete (specific case), so maybe 4. \\n\\nHmm, this is tricky. The key difference between 3 and 4 is whether the action is explicit or implicit. The question is a suggestion phrased as a question, so it\\'s implicit. The action is to address that scenario, which is concrete. So according to the scale\\'s 4 definition: \"implicitly states an action but concretely states how to implement the inferred action.\" Wait, but the reviewer isn\\'t stating how to implement. They are just pointing out the problem. \\n\\nWait, maybe the \"concrete\" part is about the problem being clear, not the solution. The action is to address the problem, which is clear. So the action is implicit but the problem is concrete. So perhaps 4. \\n\\nAlternatively, the \"concrete\" in the criteria refers to the action\\'s execution. Since the reviewer doesn\\'t say how, it\\'s vague. \\n\\nHmm, perhaps it\\'s a 4 because the problem is clearly stated (concrete), even though the solution isn\\'t. The authors can take action (they know what to address), even if the exact method isn\\'t given. \\n\\nAlternatively, the example for 2 is \"It is not clear if this trend holds across different model architectures.\" which is implicit and vague. Here, the problem is more specific. \\n\\nComparing to the example for 2: \"I wonder what would happen if you used another dataset.\" That\\'s similar to a question but more vague. \\n\\nThe current review point is more specific: it\\'s about a specific case in their method. So maybe higher than 2. \\n\\nThe example for 3 is \"You should address the lack of technical novelty...\" which is explicit but vague. Here, the question is implicit but the problem is concrete. \\n\\nHmm, I think I\\'m leaning towards 4. The problem is clearly identified (concrete), even though the solution isn\\'t given. The authors know exactly what part to address, so the action is concrete. The implicitness is in the suggestion, but the problem\\'s specificity makes it actionable. \\n\\nSo the score would be 4. \\n\\nWait, but let me check another example. The example for 4 includes \"some items in Table 2 and 3 have spaces...\" which is a specific formatting issue. The reviewer here is pointing out a specific gap in the method, which is similar.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is saying that it\\'s unclear how the proposed models compare to models that only consider different senses but not sememes. They mention the MST baseline as a possible example but note that it\\'s not well described, especially since the paper focuses more on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation. The reviewer suggests adding more baselines from related work to strengthen the paper.\\n\\nFirst, I need to assess the actionability here. The main action the reviewer is implying is that the authors should include comparisons with models that use senses without sememes, like the MST baseline. They also want better description of how MST fits into this. The reviewer is pointing out a gap in the current baseline comparisons and is suggesting specific actions: include more baselines (like MST properly described) and compare against them.\\n\\nLooking at the criteria: explicit vs implicit. The reviewer isn\\'t explicitly stating \"You must add X baselines,\" but they are clearly indicating that such comparisons are missing. The authors can infer they need to add these baselines and describe them better. That makes it implicit. \\n\\nNow, concrete vs vague. The reviewer mentions MST as an example, so there\\'s a specific baseline to look into. They also suggest looking into related work for more baselines, which gives a direction. However, the exact steps (like which other baselines specifically) aren\\'t provided. The action is somewhat concrete because MST is named, but the broader \"more baselines\" is a bit vague. \\n\\nThe key here is whether the authors know what to do. They need to check if MST is indeed such a model, describe it properly, and add other baselines from related work. The MST part is concrete, but the others require them to search related work. Since the main action is clear (include and describe these baselines), even if the exact steps are a bit vague, it\\'s mostly actionable. \\n\\nComparing to the scale, this seems like a 4 (Mostly Actionable) because the action is implicit but the MST example provides concrete guidance. The authors can take the hint and know to investigate MST and other similar models, even if they have to dig into related work to find them. It\\'s not explicit, but the direction is clear enough.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer highlights that the paper does not adequately compare the proposed models to those that consider word senses but not sememes (e.g., the MST baseline). While the MST baseline is mentioned as a potential example, the paper’s focus on soft vs. hard word sense disambiguation obscures this comparison. The reviewer implicitly suggests that the authors should (1) clarify whether the MST baseline fits this category, (2) explicitly describe its role in the comparison, and (3) include additional baselines from related work to strengthen the analysis. The action is clear (improve baseline comparisons), but the reviewer does not explicitly state \"add X baselines\" or specify all required baselines. However, the mention of MST provides a concrete starting point, and the call to \"include more baselines based on related work\" gives a clear direction. The action is inferred but sufficiently concrete for the authors to act on.  \\n\\n**Score:** 4  \\n**Reasoning:**  \\n- **Implicit Action:** The reviewer does not explicitly demand specific actions but implies that the authors need to address the comparison gap.  \\n- **Concrete Execution:** The mention of MST as a potential baseline and the directive to \"include more baselines based on related work\" provide actionable guidance. While the exact baselines may require the authors to explore related work further, the core task (e.g., revisiting MST’s role and adding similar models) is clear.

Let\\'s recall the criteria: actionability depends on whether the action is explicit or implicit and concrete or vague. \\n\\nThe reviewer is explicitly stating that discussions on convergence are required. That sounds like an explicit action. The action here is to add discussions about the convergence of the joint learning process and explain how stable points are obtained. \\n\\nNow, is the action concrete? The reviewer specifies the exact topic (convergence of RNN and CopyRNN joint learning) and the aspect to address (how stable points in the probabilistic metric space are obtained). The authors know exactly what part of their work needs discussion. However, the reviewer doesn\\'t give specifics on how to structure the discussion or what exactly to include beyond the general topic.

Let\\'s see the example for 3: \"You should address the lack of technical novelty\" is explicit but vague. Here, the action is to add a discussion on convergence and explain stable points.

The action is to add a discussion that explains this. The authors know exactly what to discuss (convergence and obtaining stable points). The \"how\" of the discussion (like writing a paragraph, adding equations, etc.) is up to them, but the what is clear. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s explicit but the implementation is somewhat vague. The reviewer doesn\\'t specify whether they need theoretical proofs, empirical analysis, or just a narrative explanation. The authors have to decide the best way to present it, but the core requirement is clear. \\n\\nComparing to the example for 4: \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y that other people have been comparing their results to.\" That\\'s implicit (suggesting to compare to X and Y) but concrete because they name the baselines. \\n\\nWait, in our case, the action is explicit (discuss convergence), but the specifics of how to present that discussion might be up to the authors. The reviewer\\'s request is explicit but the method of implementation (like adding a section, providing analysis) is not detailed. However, the key point is that the authors know exactly what needs to be addressed. \\n\\nHmm, maybe this is a 5 because it\\'s explicit and concrete in terms of the required content. The reviewer is telling them exactly what the discussion should cover. The authors can proceed by adding a section explaining the convergence and the stable points. The \"how\" of writing that section is their job, but the action itself is clear. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had said \"add a section on convergence analysis with proofs\", that would be more concrete. But here, they just say \"discussions are required on the convergence... so that readers can understand...\", which is still explicit and gives the purpose. \\n\\nLooking at another example for 5: \"What will happen if you use the evaluation metric X instead of Y?\" which is explicit and tells exactly what to do (test with X). \\n\\nIn this case, the action is to add a discussion explaining convergence and stable points.

The user wants me to evaluate the actionability of the comment: \"it is always easier to show something (i.e. attention in seq2seq MTL) is not working, but the value would lie in finding out why it fails and changing the attention mechanism so that it works.\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the aspect definition. Actionability is about how clear and concrete the suggestions are for the authors. The scale goes from 1 (unactionable) to 5 (highly actionable). The key criteria are explicit vs implicit and concrete vs vague.\\n\\nStarting with the explicit vs implicit part. The reviewer is pointing out that simply showing a method doesn\\'t work isn\\'t enough. They suggest the authors should instead find out why it fails and modify the attention mechanism. The action here is to investigate the failure and adjust the mechanism. Is this explicit or implicit? The reviewer is directly stating that the authors should do these things, so it\\'s explicit. They don\\'t leave it as a question but give a direction.\\n\\nNext, concrete vs vague. The reviewer says to \"find out why it fails\" and \"change the attention mechanism so that it works.\" The first part, \"find out why it fails,\" is a bit vague. How exactly should the authors do that? They might need to analyze the model\\'s behavior, look at attention weights, or experiment with different parts. The second part, changing the attention mechanism, is also vague. What specific changes should be made? The reviewer doesn\\'t suggest any particular modification or methodology. \\n\\nSo, even though the actions are stated explicitly, the \"how\" is missing.

They know the goal but not the exact process.\\n\\nLooking at the scale examples, a score of 3 (somewhat actionable) is when the action is explicit but vague. A score of 4 is when it\\'s implicit but concrete. Here, the action is explicit but the execution is vague, so that leans towards 3. However, the reviewer does give a direction (find why it fails and change the mechanism). Maybe it\\'s borderline between 2 and 3? \\n\\nWait, the examples for 2 (borderline) are when the action is implicit and vague. But here the action is explicit, just not concrete. The examples for 3 include \"You should address the lack of technical novelty...\" which is explicit but vague. So this seems like a 3. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s a 2 because the \"find out why\" is an implicit action? No, the reviewer is directly telling them to do that. So the explicitness is there. So 3 is correct. The authors know they need to find the reason and modify the mechanism, but the how is missing. They might need to do more experiments, analyze attention patterns, etc., but the reviewer doesn\\'t specify. Hence, somewhat actionable.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Review Point:**  \\n- It is always easier to show something (i.e., attention in seq2seq MTL) is not working, but the value would lie in finding out why it fails and changing the attention mechanism so that it works.  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment explicitly states that the authors should investigate *why* the attention mechanism in their seq2seq MTL model fails and modify it to improve performance. While the actions (\"find out why it fails\" and \"change the attention mechanism\") are directly stated, the *how* remains vague. The reviewer does not specify which aspects of the attention mechanism need adjustment, what experimental methods should be used to diagnose the failure, or what specific changes (e.g., architecture modifications, hyperparameter tuning) would address the issue. The authors know the goal but lack concrete steps to achieve it, leaving room for ambiguity.  \\n\\n**Score:** 3  \\n**Reasoning:**  \\n- **Explicit Action:** The reviewer directly instructs the authors to investigate and modify the attention mechanism.  \\n- **Vague Execution:** The comment lacks specificity about *how* to diagnose the failure or implement changes.  \\n- **Somewhat Actionable:** The actions are clear but lack concrete details, requiring the authors to infer or experiment further without guidance.']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the actionability of the comment: \"- Relies on supplemental space to contain the paper. The paper is not truly independent given this problem (esp. S3.1 reference to Sup. Fig. 6) and again later as noted with the model comparison and other details of the span vs. sentence investigation.\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the actionability criteria. The key points are whether the comment is explicit or implicit, and concrete or vague. The goal is to see if the authors can take clear steps to address the issue.\\n\\nLooking at the review point, the reviewer is pointing out that the main paper is too dependent on supplementary material. Specifically, they mention S3.1 referencing Sup. Fig. 6 and model comparisons in the span vs. sentence investigation. The reviewer is saying the main paper isn\\'t self-contained because it relies on the supplement.\\n\\nNow, the action here is implicit. The reviewer doesn\\'t explicitly say, \"Move all figures and details to the main paper,\" but they are indicating that the main paper needs to be more independent. The authors need to infer that they should reduce reliance on supplementary materials. \\n\\nIs the action concrete? The reviewer gives examples (like S3.1 and Sup. Fig.6), which helps. The authors can identify specific sections (S3.1, model comparison parts) where they need to integrate more content into the main paper. The suggestion is to make sure that key results and details aren\\'t buried in the supplement. \\n\\nHowever, the comment doesn\\'t specify exactly how much content to move or which parts are critical. The authors might need to decide what\\'s essential for the main paper versus supplementary. But the examples given do provide a starting point. \\n\\nComparing to the scale: \\n\\n- Explicit vs. Implicit: It\\'s implicit because the reviewer doesn\\'t state the action directly but points out the problem. \\n\\n- Concrete vs. Vague: The examples make it somewhat concrete, but the exact steps (like which figures to include, how much detail to add) are still up to the authors. \\n\\nSo, the action is implicit but the problem areas are specified. The authors know where the issues are but might need to figure out the best way to restructure. \\n\\nLooking at the scale, a 4 is \"Mostly Actionable\" because the action is implicit but the how is concrete enough. Wait, no—4 is when the action is implicit but the implementation is concrete. Wait, let me check the definitions again.\\n\\nThe scale says:\\n\\n4: Mostly Actionable - Implicit action but concrete on how to implement. \\n\\nWait, the definition says: \"The comment implicitly states an action but concretely states how to implement the inferred action.\" \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer points out specific references (S3.1, Sup. Fig.6, model comparison sections) where the paper relies on supplements. The concrete part is knowing exactly which sections need fixing. The action is to make those sections self-contained by moving necessary info from the supplement into the main paper. \\n\\nSo the authors can infer the action (move some content from supplement to main) and the examples give them concrete locations to address. Therefore, this might be a 4. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had said \"Move the details of S3.1 and the figure into the main paper,\" it would be explicit and concrete (5). But since it\\'s pointing out the problem and giving examples, it\\'s implicit but the how is concrete enough. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s a 3? Because the action (to make the paper independent) is explicit but vague on how? Wait, no. The action is \"make the paper independent by not relying on supplements,\" which is explicit in the problem but the how is inferred. Wait, the reviewer says \"The paper is not truly independent given this problem\" so the action is to make it independent. The examples show where the problem occurs. \\n\\nHmm. The reviewer is saying that the paper is not independent because of these references. So the action is to fix those specific instances. The authors can go to S3.1 and the model comparison sections, check where they reference the supplement, and ensure that those parts have enough info in the main text. So the action is to correct those specific references by moving necessary content. \\n\\nTherefore, the action is somewhat explicit because the problem is stated and the locations are given. The \"how\" is to include the necessary details from the supplement into the main paper in those sections. So maybe this is explicit? Because the reviewer is telling them the paper is not independent, so the action is to make it independent. The examples show where, so they can do that. \\n\\nWait, the first part of the review point says \"Relies on supplemental space to contain the paper. The paper is not truly independent...\" So the reviewer is directly pointing out the problem, but the solution is inferred. The explicitness is about the action. The action here is \"make the paper independent by not relying on supplements in those sections.\" The reviewer didn\\'t say \"you should move Sup. Fig.6 to the main paper,\" but they did point out that S3.1 references it. So the authors can take that as needing to include that figure or its key points in the main text. \\n\\nIn terms of explicit vs implicit: The reviewer is stating the problem, but the action to fix it is inferred. So implicit. \\n\\nConcrete: The examples give specific places to address. So the how is concrete (fix S3.1 and model comparison parts). \\n\\nTherefore, this is a 4: Implicit action but concrete in how to implement (they know exactly where to look and what to do—include those elements in the main paper). \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had said \"Move Sup. Fig.6 to the main paper and include the details from the supplement in sections S3.1 and model comparisons,\" that would be explicit and concrete (5). But since they didn\\'t, but provided examples, it\\'s a 4. \\n\\nI think that\\'s the right call. So the score should be 4.\\n</think>\\n\\n    rationale: The comment points out that the main paper is overly reliant on supplementary material, specifically referencing S3.1 and its connection to Sup. Fig. 6, as well as model comparisons and span vs. sentence details. While the reviewer does not explicitly state that the authors should move specific content into the main paper, the problem is clearly identified, and the examples provide concrete locations where dependencies on the supplement exist. Authors can infer the need to integrate key details (e.g., figures, explanations) from the supplementary material into the main']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate its actionability based on the given criteria. The review point is about the experiments in a paper being a weakness because they\\'re only in a low-resource setting and focus on sentence classification, which is easier. The reviewer suggests the method could be applied to more NLP tasks but that wasn\\'t shown.\\n\\nFirst, I need to break down the components. The reviewer points out two main issues: the experiments are limited to low-resource scenarios and an easier task. They also mention the potential for the method on other tasks but note it wasn\\'t demonstrated. \\n\\nLooking at the actionability criteria, I need to check if the comment provides explicit or implicit actions and whether those are concrete or vague. The reviewer doesn\\'t explicitly tell the authors to do something like \"add experiments on more tasks\" but implies that they should. The suggestion to consider other tasks and settings is there, but it\\'s not specific. \\n\\nThe action here is to expand the experiments beyond the current setup. However, the reviewer doesn\\'t specify which tasks or what other resource regimes to include. The authors know they need to do more experiments but might not know exactly which ones. That makes the action implicit and somewhat vague. \\n\\nComparing to the scale: since the action is implied but not concrete on how to proceed, it might be a 2 or 3. The reviewer does state the problem clearly, so it\\'s not unactionable. Since they mention potential tasks but not specifics, it\\'s vague. So maybe a 2? Wait, but the comment does suggest that the method has potential for more tasks, so the action is to explore those. But without specifics, it\\'s still vague. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had said \"test on task X and Y in medium/high-resource settings,\" that would be concrete. Since they didn\\'t, it\\'s a 2. But maybe it\\'s a 3 because the action is somewhat explicit? Hmm. The reviewer says \"I feel like the proposed augmentation method has potential to be used on more NLP tasks, which was unfortunately not shown.\" So they are explicitly saying that they expected to see more tasks. The authors can take that as a suggestion to include more tasks and settings. So the action is explicit (they should include more tasks and settings) but the how is vague. \\n\\nLooking at the scale\\'s 3: \"explicitly states an action but is vague on how to execute it.\" The examples given for 3 include \"You should address the lack of technical novelty\" which is explicit but vague. Similarly, \"comparing your method to other previous related work is highly suggested.\" So in this case, the reviewer is suggesting to show the method on more tasks and settings, which is explicit but the specifics are vague. So that would be a 3. \\n\\nWait, but the first part about the low-resource regime being the only case: the reviewer is saying they should test in other resource settings. So the actions are: 1) expand to other resource regimes, 2) test on harder or different NLP tasks. The reviewer is explicitly pointing out these omissions and suggesting that the experiments should be stronger. The authors can infer they need to do these, but the exact tasks and settings are not specified. \\n\\nSo the action is explicit (you should do more experiments on other tasks and settings) but vague in how (which tasks, which settings). Therefore, this would be a 3. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had said \"include experiments on NER and machine translation in medium-resource settings,\" that would be concrete (score 5). Since they didn\\'t, it\\'s explicit but vague, so 3.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer explicitly points out that the experiments are limited to low-resource regimes and sentence classification (an easier task), and suggests expanding to more NLP tasks and settings. While the action (e.g., \"include experiments on additional tasks and resource regimes\") is clear and explicit, the reviewer does not specify *which* tasks, *what* resource regimes, or *how* to design these experiments. The authors know they need to broaden their experimental scope but lack concrete guidance on implementation.  \\n\\n**Score:** 3  \\n**Explanation:**  \\nThe comment is **explicit** (the reviewer directly states the need for stronger experiments and broader applicability) but **vague** (no specifics on tasks, resource levels, or methodology).

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is asking if treating concept map extraction as a separate task is necessary. They mention that generic summarization systems often build a knowledge graph and then generate summaries. Also, they note that as the number of nodes increases, the concept map becomes harder to distinguish, suggesting that general summaries might be more readable.\\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actionability based on the criteria given. Actionability is about whether the authors can take clear, concrete steps from this feedback. The comment starts with a question, which is a clarification request. The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with the approach but doesn\\'t explicitly state what the authors should do. \\n\\nThe reviewer presents two points: comparing to existing systems that handle summarization with knowledge graphs and the problem of node number affecting readability. The question implies that maybe the authors don\\'t need to separate concept map extraction. But the action isn\\'t explicit. The authors might need to infer that they should either justify the necessity of the separate task or consider integrating it into summarization. However, the reviewer doesn\\'t give specific steps like \"add a comparison\" or \"modify the method to combine tasks.\"\\n\\nLooking at the scale, explicit vs. implicit: the action here is implicit because the reviewer is posing a question rather than giving a direct suggestion. The authors have to figure out the action themselves. Then, concrete vs. vague: even if they infer the action (like rethinking the task separation), there\\'s no guidance on how to do it. They might not know whether to provide more justification, redesign the method, or compare with other systems. \\n\\nSince the action is implicit and vague, it might fall into borderline actionable (score 2). But wait, the reviewer does mention that other systems do it differently, so maybe the action is to compare or adjust the approach. However, without explicit instructions, it\\'s still vague. The authors could interpret this as needing to discuss why their approach is necessary or revise the method. But the lack of concrete steps makes it hard to know exactly what to do. \\n\\nComparing to examples in the scale: the \"I wonder what would happen...\" examples are score 2. This is similar because it\\'s a question prompting the authors to consider an alternative approach without clear direction. So, probably a 2. But wait, the reviewer also mentions the node number issue leading to readability problems. That\\'s another point. Maybe the authors should address how their method handles node numbers, but again, it\\'s not explicit. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer\\'s question leads the authors to either justify the task separation or modify their approach, but since there\\'s no explicit suggestion, it\\'s still implicit and vague. So I think the score here is 2.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review point raises a question about the necessity of treating concept map extraction as a separate task, contrasting it with generic summarization systems that build knowledge graphs and generate summaries. The reviewer also highlights that increasing node numbers in concept maps may reduce readability, suggesting general summaries might be preferable. However, the comment does not explicitly state what action the authors should take (e.g., rethinking the task separation, providing justification, or modifying the method). While the implications suggest possible adjustments, the lack of concrete steps or direct instructions leaves the authors to infer the required changes. The action is implicit (needing to be inferred) and vague (no clear guidance on how to address the concerns).  \\n\\n**Score:** 2 (Borderline Actionable)  \\n\\n**Rationale Details:**  \\n- **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The comment is framed as a question and critique, requiring the authors to infer the desired action (e.g., justifying the task separation or redesigning the approach).  \\n- **Concrete vs. Vague:** Even if the authors infer the need to address the critique, the reviewer does not specify *how* to do so (e.g., compare with existing systems, reduce node numbers, or integrate tasks).

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The comment says, \"3. It will be nice to see some examples of the system on actual texts (vs. other components & models).\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out where this falls on the actionability scale. The aspect we\\'re evaluating is how actionable the comment is for the authors. The key points from the aspect description are whether the action is explicit or implicit, and concrete or vague.\\n\\nStarting with explicit vs. implicit: The reviewer is suggesting that examples of the system applied to actual texts would be nice. The wording here is a bit indirect. They don\\'t explicitly say \"you should add examples of the system on actual texts,\" but it\\'s implied. So this is more of an implicit suggestion. \\n\\nNext, concrete vs. vague: The comment mentions wanting to see examples, but it doesn\\'t specify what kind of examples, how many, or in which sections of the paper they should be included. The authors might know they need to add examples but aren\\'t told exactly where or how to present them. The part \"vs. other components & models\" might mean comparing their system\\'s examples with others, but without more details, it\\'s still vague. \\n\\nThe importance here is that even though the action is implicit, the core idea is to include examples. However, without specifics on how to execute this (like which parts of the text, what format, or what aspects to highlight), the authors might struggle to implement the suggestion effectively. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scale: The borderline actionable (score 2) examples include things like \"I wonder what would happen if you used another dataset,\" which is similar in that it\\'s a suggestion without concrete steps. The somewhat actionable (score 3) examples have explicit actions but vague execution, like \"You should address the lack of technical novelty.\" \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer is suggesting adding examples, which is an explicit action (since \"it will be nice to see\" is a direct request), but the execution is vague. Wait, hold on. Wait, the explicit vs. implicit part: the comment says \"it will be nice to see some examples...\" which is a suggestion, but is it explicit? The action here is to add examples, so maybe it\\'s explicit. But the how is vague. \\n\\nLooking at the scale\\'s criteria for explicit: \"direct or apparent actions\". The comment is a suggestion, but it\\'s a direct request. The action is explicit (add examples), but the concrete part is missing. So according to the scale, if the action is explicit but the execution is vague, that\\'s a 3. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the action is explicit (you should add examples) but the how is not specified, then it\\'s explicit but vague. The scale says: \"3: Somewhat Actionable\" is when the action is explicit but vague on how to execute. \\n\\nYes, so this would be a 3. The reviewer is explicitly saying to include examples of the system on actual texts, which is a clear action, but the specifics (which examples, how to present, where to put them) are missing. The authors know they need to add examples but might not know exactly how to do so effectively. \\n\\nWait, but the original examples for score 3 include \"Comparing your method to other previous related work is highly suggested.\" That\\'s similar to this, where the action is explicit (add comparisons/examples) but vague on how. So yes, this should be a 3. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the action is implicit, like \"it would be nice to see...\", maybe that\\'s more implicit. Hmm. The definition says explicit includes clarification questions that give direct action. Here, the suggestion is phrased as a desire, but it\\'s a direct suggestion. \\n\\nThe key is whether the action is direct. \"It will be nice to see X\" is a suggestion, but it\\'s a direct way of telling the authors to include X. So explicit. Then the concrete part is missing. Therefore, it\\'s explicit but vague, so score 3. \\n\\nTherefore, the rationale would be that the comment explicitly suggests adding examples of the system on actual texts, but doesn\\'t specify which examples, how to present them, or where to include them. The action is clear but lacks concrete details on implementation, making it somewhat actionable.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review comment explicitly suggests that the authors should include examples of their system applied to actual texts, contrasting them with other components and models. While the action (adding examples) is directly stated, the comment lacks specificity regarding *what* examples to include, *how* to present them (e.g., in figures, tables, or text), and *where* to place them in the paper. The authors know they need to incorporate such examples but may struggle to determine the precise scope, format, or context for these additions. The vagueness in execution details places this comment in the \"somewhat actionable\" category.  \\n\\n**Score:** 3']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate its actionability based on the given criteria. First, I need to recall the actionability scale and the definitions. \\n\\nThe review point is: \\n- Two things must be improved in the presentation of the model: (1) What is the pooling method used for embedding features (line 397)? and (2) Equation (7) in line 472 is not clear enough: is E_i the random variable representing the *type* of AC i, or its *identity*? Both are supposedly modeled (the latter by feature representation), and need to be defined. Furthermore, it seems like the LHS of equation (7) should be a conditional probability.\\n\\nStarting with the first part (1): The reviewer is asking a question about the pooling method used at line 397. According to the aspect description, clarification questions that give a direct action are considered explicit. The action here is to clarify the pooling method. The authors can directly address this by specifying which pooling method was used in that line. That seems explicit and concrete because they just need to state the method there.\\n\\nMoving to part (2): The reviewer is pointing out ambiguity in Equation (7). They specifically ask whether E_i refers to the type or identity of AC i. They also mention that both aspects are modeled and need to be defined. Additionally, they note that the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation should be a conditional probability. \\n\\nBreaking this down, the reviewer is asking for two things here: \\n- Clarification on the definition of E_i in the equation, specifying whether it\\'s type or identity. \\n- Correcting the LHS to be a conditional probability if that\\'s the case. \\n\\nThese are specific points. The authors can address each part by redefining E_i in the equation and adjusting the LHS accordingly. The reviewer provides enough detail (specific line numbers, equation number, and the nature of the problem) so the authors know exactly where to look and what needs fixing. \\n\\nNow, considering the actionability criteria: \\n\\n1. **Explicit vs. Implicit**: Both points (1) and (2) are explicit. The first is a direct question requiring a clarification. The second has specific issues (definition of variables and equation structure) that the authors can address directly. \\n\\n2. **Concrete vs. Vague**: The actions here are concrete. For (1), the author must specify the pooling method used. For (2), they need to define E_i clearly and adjust the equation\\'s LHS. The reviewer even suggests that the LHS should be a conditional probability, which gives a clear direction on how to fix it. There\\'s no ambiguity in what needs to be done. \\n\\nLooking at the scale:\\n- **Score 5 (Highly Actionable)** requires explicit actions with concrete details. \\n- The review points here are explicit and the required actions are very specific. The authors can implement the changes without guessing. \\n\\nThe only possible hesitation might be if part (2) requires deeper understanding, but the reviewer\\'s explanation is clear enough. They specify the ambiguity in E_i\\'s definition and suggest the equation\\'s LHS should be a conditional probability. That\\'s actionable. \\n\\nSo, both parts are explicit and concrete. Therefore, the score should be 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review point explicitly identifies two specific issues in the model presentation:  \\n1. **Clarifying the pooling method** used for embedding features at line 397. This is a direct request for the authors to specify the method, making the action explicit and concrete.  \\n2. **Addressing ambiguities in Equation (7)** (line 472):  \\n   - The reviewer asks whether \\\\( E_i \\\\) refers to the *type* or *identity* of AC \\\\( i \\\\), requiring the authors to define the variable clearly.  \\n   - They also note that the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation should likely be a conditional probability, providing a concrete suggestion for correction.  \\n\\nBoth actions are explicit, specific, and provide clear instructions for the authors (e.g., \"define \\\\( E_i \\\\)\", \"adjust the LHS\"). The reviewer’s feedback leaves no ambiguity about what needs to be done or where.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reasoning:** The review is **highly actionable** because it explicitly states two distinct actions with concrete details (line numbers, equation references, and specific corrections).

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is commenting on the paper\\'s claim that the model generalizes to different types of knowledge. The specific points they raise are:\\n\\n1. The model requires substructures to be represented as a sequence of words. For example, using a constituent parse tree as knowledge doesn\\'t seem straightforward.\\n2. The term \"knowledge\" might be misleading here because it\\'s typically associated with external knowledge like a knowledge base of entities, whereas the paper is using syntax (or possibly semantics via AMR parsing) instead.\\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actionability of this comment based on the criteria given. Let\\'s break it down according to the Actionability Scale.\\n\\nStarting with the two criteria: Explicit vs. Implicit and Concrete vs. Vague.\\n\\n**Explicit vs. Implicit**: The reviewer is pointing out a potential misnomer in the paper\\'s terminology (\"knowledge\" vs. syntax/AMR) and a limitation in the model\\'s handling of non-word-sequence structures (like constituent parses). The actions implied here are:\\n\\n- Clarify or redefine what is meant by \"knowledge\" in the context of the paper.\\n- Address whether the model can handle substructures that aren\\'t sequences of words (like parse trees) and explain why it might not be straightforward.\\n\\nThese points are not explicitly stated as direct actions, but they can be inferred. The reviewer is suggesting that the authors need to revise their terminology and possibly their methodology or explanations regarding the model\\'s capabilities with different knowledge types. So this is more implicit than explicit.\\n\\n**Concrete vs. Vague**: The reviewer provides specific examples (constituent parse vs. word sequences) and contrasts the use of \"knowledge\" in the paper versus the conventional understanding. However, the suggested actions aren\\'t spelled out. The authors know they need to address the terminology issue and the model\\'s limitations with non-sequence structures, but the exact steps (like redefining terms, adding experiments with parse trees, or discussing limitations) aren\\'t specified. \\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s points are concrete in identifying the problem areas but vague in terms of how to fix them. For instance, they mention that constituent parses aren\\'t straightforward to use, but they don\\'t say whether the authors should modify the model to handle them, provide a justification, or acknowledge this as a limitation.\\n\\n**Importance of Concreteness**: The scale emphasizes that concreteness is crucial. While the reviewer gives clear examples, the actionable steps aren\\'t explicit. The authors know where the issue is but might need to infer how to resolve it. \\n\\nComparing to the examples in the Actionability Scale:\\n\\n- **Score 4 (Mostly Actionable)**: The action is implicit but the how is concrete. For instance, the reviewer might have said, \"Clarify the definition of \\'knowledge\\' to distinguish it from external KBs and explain why parse trees aren\\'t easily integrated.\" But here, the reviewer\\'s points are more about identifying the problem rather than the solution steps.\\n\\n- **Score 3 (Somewhat Actionable)**: The action is explicit but vague. The reviewer isn\\'t explicitly telling the authors to do something, just pointing out issues. The authors need to infer the necessary actions (e.g., redefine terms, add experiments, discuss limitations).\\n\\nWait, the criteria for 3 is explicit action but vague on how. Here, the actions are implicit (since they\\'re inferred), so maybe 2 or 3? Let me check again.\\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s comment is pointing out that the term \"knowledge\" is misleading and that the model\\'s approach to substructures is limited. The implied actions are to redefine terminology and address the limitation. Since the reviewer is asking the authors to consider these points, the actions are implicit. The \"how\" is not specified (e.g., should they modify the model, add a discussion, or both?). \\n\\nLooking at the borderline between 2 and 3. The Scale says:\\n\\n- **2 (Borderline)**: Implicit action that\\'s vague. The reviewer\\'s comment is implying actions but not giving concrete steps. The authors know the problem but not exactly how to fix it.\\n\\n- **3 (Somewhat Actionable)**: Explicit action but vague execution. Here, the actions are implicit, so maybe 2?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the reviewer\\'s mention of constituent parses and the terminology issue gives enough concrete points to act on. The authors can:\\n\\n- Redefine \"knowledge\" in their work to clarify it\\'s about syntax/AMR, not external KBs.\\n\\n- Discuss the limitation regarding non-word-sequence structures (like parse trees) and perhaps suggest future work or acknowledge it as a current constraint.\\n\\nThese are concrete enough actions even if not explicitly stated. So maybe it\\'s a 3?\\n\\nWait, the Scale\\'s example for 3 is \"You should address the lack of technical novelty...\" which is explicit but vague on how. Here, the reviewer isn\\'t using \"you should\" but is pointing out issues that require action. The action is explicit in the sense that the problem is clear, but the solution steps are vague. \\n\\nHmm. The key is whether the action is explicit or implicit. The reviewer isn\\'t giving a direct suggestion like \"You should redefine \\'knowledge\\'...\" so it\\'s implicit. Since the action is implicit but the problem is clear (so the action is concrete in the problem area but not in the solution), maybe it\\'s a 3?\\n\\nWait, the Scale\\'s 4 is for implicit actions but with concrete implementation. The example given for 4 is \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y...\" which implies the action (add those baselines) and the how (specific baselines). In this case, the reviewer\\'s points are pointing out that the terminology is misleading and the model can\\'t handle certain structures. The \"how\" to fix terminology is concrete (redefine it), but the \"how\" to handle the structures might require more thought. The reviewer doesn\\'t specify experiments or modifications, so the \"how\" is vague for that part.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the reviewer\\'s comment is somewhat actionable because the problem areas are clear, so the authors know what needs to be addressed, even if the exact steps aren\\'t given.

The reviewer is pointing out that when \"multigraph\" is first mentioned, some readers might need a brief explanation. They also mention it was noted before in many previous instances.

The reviewer doesn\\'t specify which part exactly, but the context is the mention of \"many previous\". The action here would be to rephrase that phrase to make it less awkward. However, since the exact location or wording isn\\'t given, it\\'s a bit vague. The authors need to find where \"many previous\" is used and fix it, but without more detail, it\\'s implicit and a bit vague. They might need to search the text for instances of that phrasing and adjust accordingly.\\n\\nThird part: \"Solving this task: which one?\" This seems to refer to a sentence where \"this task\" is unclear. The reviewer is pointing out that the antecedent for \"this task\" isn\\'t clear, so the authors need to clarify which task they\\'re referring to. The action is explicit: specify which task is being solved. However, the exact location isn\\'t mentioned, so the authors have to find instances of \"Solving this task\" and ensure the task is clearly defined earlier or restated.\\n\\nPutting it all together. Each part has some explicit actions but some vagueness. The first part is explicit and concrete (add a definition for multigraph). The second is implicit and vague (rephrase \"many previous\" but where?), and the third is explicit but requires the authors to locate the ambiguous reference. \\n\\nThe first point is definitely actionable. The second and third points are somewhat actionable because they tell the authors what\\'s wrong but lack specifics on where exactly to fix. Since the reviewer didn\\'t point to specific lines, the authors might have to search for instances. The first part is a 3 or 4, maybe. The second and third parts might bring it down. \\n\\nLooking at the scale: \\n\\n- For the multigraph part: explicit and concrete (score 5?), but the other parts are lower. Since the overall review point combines all three, the lowest common denominator might be 3. Wait, but each part is separate. The first is explicit and concrete (5), but the others are more vague. \\n\\nAlternatively, the overall comment\\'s actionability is the average. Let\\'s see:\\n\\nFirst part: explicit and concrete (score 5). Second part: implicit and vague (score 2). Third part: explicit but requires the author to find the instance (maybe score 3). \\n\\nBut the review point as a whole has a mix. The first part is highly actionable, but the others are lower. Since the scale is about the entire comment, maybe the overall score is 3. But maybe the first part\\'s high score can push it up. Alternatively, the reviewer\\'s mention of \"previously noted by...\" might be confusing, making the first part less clear. Wait, the first part says \"previously noted by ... many previous\" which might be a typo or incomplete thought. Maybe the reviewer meant to reference prior comments but didn\\'t finish. That could make the first part less clear. \\n\\nAlternatively, the first part is still actionable even if the \"previously noted\" part is unclear. The main action is to add a description of multigraph. The rest of the comment\\'s parts are less clear. \\n\\nOverall, the first part is explicit and concrete (5), but the other two parts are vague (2 and 3). Since the review point combines all three, the score might be 3 because two parts are somewhat actionable and one is higher. But maybe the majority is in the middle. \\n\\nAlternatively, the reviewer\\'s main points are each actionable to some extent. The first is 5, the second 2, third 3. The average would be around 3.3, so rounded to 3. \\n\\nAlternatively, the worst part drags it down. Since two parts are lower, the overall score is 3. \\n\\nI think the score here is 3. The first part is concrete, but the others are vague. The reviewer could have been more specific on where \"many previous\" is and which task is unclear. So the comment is somewhat actionable but not highly.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Review Point:**  \\n- first mention of multigraph: some readers may benefit if the notion of a multigraph would get a short description - previously noted by ... many previous: sounds a little odd - Solving this task: which one?  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review comment includes three distinct points:  \\n1. **Multigraph description:** The reviewer explicitly suggests adding a short description of \"multigraph\" upon its first mention, which is a clear and concrete action.  \\n2. **Awkward phrasing (\"many previous\"):** The reviewer flags the phrase \"many previous\" as awkward but does not specify its location or provide guidance on how to rephrase it. This action is implicit and vague.  \\n3. **Ambiguous task reference (\"Solving this task\"):** The reviewer points out that the task being referred to is unclear, requiring the authors to clarify the antecedent of \"this task.\" While the action is explicit, the exact location of the ambiguity is unspecified, leaving it somewhat vague.  \\n\\nThe first point is highly actionable (explicit and concrete), but the second and third points lack specificity, making them implicit or vague. The overall comment’s actionability is dragged down by the vagueness of the latter two points.  \\n\\n**Score:** 3  \\n**Reasoning:** While one part of the comment is concrete, the others require the authors to infer or locate the issues themselves, resulting in a \"somewhat actionable\" rating.']\n",

The reviewer is giving a direct suggestion here. They're telling the authors to add a particular baseline, which is a clear action. So that leans towards explicit. \\n\\nNext, Concrete vs. Vague. The details provided are quite specific. They mention the exact matrices (H, I, J, K, L) and their dimensions (like R^{r x r}, R^{r x o}, etc.). They also explain the rationale that parsing F1 might not be directly comparable but perplexity can be. This gives the authors clear instructions on what to do and how to set up the baseline. The reviewer even points out what metrics can be compared, which helps the authors understand the expected outcome. \\n\\nSo putting it together, the action is explicit because it directly tells the authors to add a baseline with specific parameters.

The two main aspects are whether the action is explicit or implicit, and concrete or vague.\\n\\nStarting with the explicit vs. implicit part. The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with scalability of the robust training scheme in high-dimensional domains. They mention that accuracy might not scale well unless the size of V (probably a parameter or variable) grows exponentially with the dimension. The comment is stating a problem but isn\\'t directly telling the authors what to do. Instead, it\\'s implying that they need to address this scalability issue. So the action here is implicit because the authors have to infer that they should find a way to make the training scheme scalable or validate its applicability in high dimensions.\\n\\nNext, looking at concrete vs. vague. The reviewer provides some specifics: the problem is with scalability in high-dimensional datasets and the exponential scaling of V. However, they don\\'t give concrete steps on how to fix this. They don\\'t suggest specific methods, experiments, or changes to the training scheme. The authors know the issue but aren\\'t told exactly how to resolve it.

The authors might need to explore ways to adjust V or find a different approach, but without guidance, it\\'s still vague.\\n\\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, similar comments about scalability without specific actions got scores like 2 or 3. The comment here is pointing out a problem but not giving a direct solution. It\\'s more implicit and vague. Comparing to the example where a comment about baseline comparisons not being done (scored 4), this might be similar but less specific.

The comment \"You should address the lack of technical novelty\" is 3 (explicit but vague). \\n\\nIn our case, the reviewer is saying \"the applicability seems unlikely to scale... accuracy would scale unfavorably unless V scales exponentially\". The action here is to address the scalability issue. The reviewer isn\\'t directly telling the authors to do something, so it\\'s implicit. The action is to fix the scalability problem, but how? The reviewer doesn\\'t say. So it\\'s an implicit action that\\'s vague. Hence, it should be a 2 (borderline actionable). \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer\\'s comment is pointing out a flaw that the authors need to address (so the action is implicit), but the problem is clearly stated, maybe it\\'s a 3? Hmm. Let me think again.\\n\\nThe explicit vs. implicit part: If the reviewer says \"you should do X\", that\\'s explicit. If they say \"the problem is Y, so you need to fix it\", that\\'s explicit. But here, the reviewer just states the problem without suggesting an action. So the action is implicit. The action is \"you need to make the training scheme scalable or validate its scalability\". Since that\\'s inferred, it\\'s implicit. \\n\\nThe concrete vs. vague part: The problem is specific (scaling with V and dimension), but the solution isn\\'t.

However, the problem is technical, so the authors might have to think of ways to adjust their method. But since there\\'s no suggestion, it\\'s like \"the method has this problem\" without guidance.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. First, I need to figure out the actionability based on the criteria given. The review point here is a bit of a mix. Let me break it down.\\n\\nThe first part seems to be about correcting some typos or formatting issues in the text. For example, \"s/expensive approaches2) allows/expensive approaches,2) allows/\" – this looks like a typo correction where they want a comma added. Similarly, \"p.8: s/estimates3) is/estimates, and3) is/\" – again, adding commas. These are very specific and direct instructions. The authors can go to the exact pages and make those changes. That part is explicit and concrete.\\n\\nThen there\\'s the references section. The reviewer points out capitalization issues in several references. They mention specific examples like \"ai\" in Amodei et al. (2016) should be capitalized, \"bayesian\" needs capitalization, and the title \"Advances in neural information processing systems\" should be properly capitalized. Also, they note that some references have incorrect conference details: Dusenberry et al. (2020) was published in ICML 2020, Osawa et al. (2019) in NeurIPS 2019, and Swiatkowski et al. (2020) in ICML 2020. These are all very specific corrections. The authors can directly go to each reference and fix the capitalization and conference details as specified. \\n\\nThe last part mentions \"p. 13, supplement, Fig.\" but it\\'s cut off. However, even without the full sentence, the previous parts are clear. \\n\\nNow, applying the actionability criteria: \\n\\n1. **Explicit vs. Implicit**: The corrections here are explicit. The reviewer is directly telling the authors to make specific changes (like adding commas, correcting capitalization, updating conference details). No need to infer what needs to be done.\\n\\n2. **Concrete vs. Vague**: The actions are concrete. Each correction is specific. The authors know exactly where to look (page numbers, specific references) and how to fix them. They don\\'t need to guess how to implement the changes.\\n\\nThere\\'s no ambiguity here. The reviewer is giving precise instructions. Even the part about the figure on page 13 of the supplement, though incomplete, is likely a specific request that the authors can address once they see the figure. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scale, this is similar to the score 5 examples where explicit and concrete actions are provided.

It identifies exact page numbers (e.g., page 8), specific corrections (e.g., adding commas in \"expensive approaches,2) allows\"), and precise references (e.g., Amodei et al. (2016), Osawa et al. (2019)) that require capitalization fixes or conference details adjustments. Each action is direct and unambiguous, leaving no room for interpretation. The authors can implement these changes without ambiguity, as the reviewer specifies exactly what to modify and where. The only incomplete part (\"p. 13, supplement, Fig.\") is likely a minor oversight but still points to a specific location in the supplement for the authors to address.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reason:** The comment contains explicit actions with concrete details, allowing the authors to execute the changes precisely.']\n",

The two main criteria are Explicit vs. Implicit and Concrete vs. Vague. \\n\\nStarting with Explicit vs. Implicit: The reviewer is directly asking questions here. They want specific information: the model parameters for task 1, the lambda value, and the method of choosing parameters. These are explicit requests because they\\'re clearly stated actions the authors should take. The reviewer isn\\'t leaving it to the authors to infer; they\\'re pointing out missing details and asking for them to be included.\\n\\nNext, Concrete vs. Vague: The questions are very specific. The reviewer mentions \"model parameters for task 1,\" \"lambda for the Boltzmann policy,\" and the selection method (like maximum likelihood). These are all concrete details. The authors know exactly what parameters to report and what explanations to add. The reviewer isn\\'t just saying \"explain parameters\" in a vague way but is pointing out exact missing pieces. \\n\\nNow, considering the Actionability Scale.

These are direct requests that require the authors to provide concrete details. The reviewer leaves no ambiguity about what needs to be addressed—authors must specify the parameters, report the lambda value, and clarify the parameter selection process. The actions are explicit and concrete, as the reviewer identifies exact elements to include and how to address them.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reasoning:**  \\n- **Explicit:** The reviewer directly asks for specific parameter values and selection methods.  \\n- **Concrete:** The actions (reporting parameters, lambda, and methodology) are clearly defined, leaving no ambiguity about what the authors must do.  \\nThis aligns with the **Highly Actionable** category (score 5), as the feedback provides explicit, concrete instructions for improvement.']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point: \"the required implicit call to the Witness oracle is confusing.\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out where this falls on the actionability scale. The aspect is about how helpful the comment is for authors to improve their draft. The key here is to see if the comment gives clear, concrete actions or if it\\'s vague.\\n\\nStarting with the definition of actionability. The two criteria are explicit vs. implicit and concrete vs. vague. The comment says the \"implicit call to the Witness oracle is confusing.\" \\n\\nHmm, so the reviewer is pointing out that there\\'s a part where the Witness oracle is called implicitly, and that\\'s causing confusion. Let me break it down. \\n\\nFirst, is the action explicit or implicit? The reviewer is telling the authors that the implicit call is confusing. The suggested action here might be to make the call to the Witness oracle more explicit. But does the comment actually state that? The reviewer doesn\\'t say \"you should make the call explicit\" directly. Instead, they point out the confusion arising from the implicit call. So the action is implied. The authors need to infer that they should clarify how the Witness oracle is called, perhaps make it explicit instead of implicit. So that\\'s implicit in terms of the action.\\n\\nNow, is the action concrete or vague? If the authors know they need to clarify the call to the Witness oracle, but how exactly? The reviewer doesn\\'t specify what needs to be done. They don\\'t explain how the call should be made explicit, or what part of the explanation is unclear. The authors might need to figure out where the implicit call is, why it\\'s confusing, and how to rephrase or add details to make it clearer. Since the comment doesn\\'t give specifics on how to fix it, the action is vague. \\n\\nSo according to the scale, if the action is implicit and vague, that would fall into a score of 2 (borderline actionable). But wait, let me check the examples again. \\n\\nLooking at the examples for score 2: \"I wonder what would happen if you used another dataset.\" That\\'s a borderline because it\\'s a question implying an action but vague. The current comment here is similar in that it points out confusion but doesn\\'t suggest a specific fix. \\n\\nAlternatively, could it be a 3? If the action is explicit but vague. Wait, the action here is implicit (since the reviewer doesn\\'t say \"make it explicit\"), so it\\'s more like a 2. \\n\\nAnother angle: The reviewer is indicating that the current way the Witness oracle is called (implicitly) is causing confusion. The authors could take action by making the call explicit, but since the reviewer doesn\\'t explicitly tell them to do that, it\\'s an implicit action. The how is still vague because the reviewer doesn\\'t say, for example, \"add a step explaining the call\" or \"refer to section X for details.\" \\n\\nTherefore, the action is implicit (needs to be inferred) and vague (no concrete steps). So that\\'s a 2. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the action is somewhat explicit? The reviewer says \"implicit call is confusing,\" so the suggestion is to make it explicit? Maybe that\\'s an explicit action? Let me think again. \\n\\nThe comment is pointing out that the current approach (implicit call) is confusing, so the action would be to make it explicit. The reviewer is implying that they need to make the call explicit. So the action is \"make the call explicit,\" which is an explicit action? Or is the action still inferred?\\n\\nHmm, the wording is \"the required implicit call... is confusing.\" The reviewer is saying that the implicit call is required but is confusing. So maybe the problem is that it\\'s required to be implicit, but that\\'s causing confusion, so perhaps the authors need to explain it better even if it\\'s implicit, or make it explicit. \\n\\nThe reviewer might be suggesting that the call should not be implicit, hence the confusion. So the action is to make it explicit. Since the reviewer didn\\'t say \"you should make it explicit,\" but the implication is clear, that might be explicit. \\n\\nWait, in the scale, explicit actions are direct. If the comment says \"you should make the call explicit,\" that\\'s explicit. But here, the reviewer is pointing out the problem (implicit call is confusing), so the action is inferred. So the action is implicit. \\n\\nTherefore, the action is implicit (needs to be inferred) and vague (no details on how to fix it beyond making it explicit). \\n\\nSo that would be a score of 2 (borderline actionable). \\n\\nAlternatively, if the action is to clarify the explanation of the Witness oracle\\'s call, that\\'s somewhat explicit. Wait, the reviewer says \"implicit call is confusing,\" so the action is to clarify how the call is made. The authors can infer that they need to explain the call more clearly, perhaps making it explicit. \\n\\nIn that case, the action is somewhat explicit (the problem is the implicitness leading to confusion, so the solution is to make it explicit), but the how is still vague. Since making it explicit is a concrete action (they can go and rewrite that part to be explicit), maybe it\\'s concrete?\\n\\nWait, concrete means once you know the action, you know how to do it. If the action is \"make the call explicit,\" then knowing that, the authors can do it. So the action is implicit (the reviewer didn\\'t say \"make it explicit\" directly) but once inferred, the action is concrete. \\n\\nWait, the criteria for actionability: \\n\\n- Explicit: direct action. \\n\\n- Implicit: inferred. \\n\\nConcrete: once action is identified, authors know exactly what to do. \\n\\nVague: even after knowing the action, they don\\'t know how. \\n\\nIn this case, if the action is \"make the call explicit,\" then once the authors realize that, they can do it. So the action is concrete. \\n\\nBut the action is inferred (implicit), so the score would be 4: implicit but concrete. \\n\\nWait, the scale says:\\n\\n4: Mostly Actionable - Implicit action but concrete on how to implement. \\n\\nSo if the action is implicit (the reviewer didn\\'t say \"make it explicit\" but implied it), but once you figure out the action (make it explicit), then it\\'s concrete. \\n\\nTherefore, this would be a 4. \\n\\nHmm, now I\\'m confused between 2 and 4. \\n\\nLet me re-examine the examples. \\n\\nFor example, in the given examples, \"The idea of using positional encodings (PEs) for GNNs on molecular graph regression is not new.\" is a 1. \\n\\nAnother example for 4: \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y that other people have been comparing their results to.\" \\n\\nIn that case, the action is to include those baselines, which is implicit (they have to infer to add them), but the how is concrete because the reviewer suggests specific baselines. \\n\\nIn our case, the reviewer says \"implicit call to the Witness oracle is confusing.\" The action is to make the call explicit. The reviewer didn\\'t say \"you should explain how the Witness oracle is called\" but the problem is that the current implicit call is confusing. So the action is to make it explicit, which is a concrete action (they can rewrite the section to explain the call explicitly). \\n\\nTherefore, the action is implicit (they have to infer that making it explicit is needed) but the implementation is concrete. Hence, this is a 4. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the reviewer didn\\'t specify what part is confusing. The authors might need to figure out which part of the implicit call is causing confusion. But the reviewer didn\\'t give specifics. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the confusion is due to the implicitness itself. So the solution is to make it explicit. \\n\\nTherefore, the action is concrete once inferred. \\n\\nHence, this would be a 4. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had said \"you should explain the call to the Witness oracle in more detail,\" that would be explicit and concrete (5). \\n\\nBut here, the reviewer\\'s comment is pointing out the problem (implicit call is confusing), so the action is inferred (make it explicit) and the how is clear (explain it explicitly). \\n\\nTherefore, it\\'s a 4. \\n\\nWait, but the original examples for 4 include \"Some items in Table 2 and Table 3 have spaces between accuracy and standard deviation, and some items don\\'t, which affects beauty.\" Here the action is to fix the formatting, which is concrete once you infer the action. \\n\\nIn our case, the action is to make the call explicit, which is concrete. \\n\\nSo yes, the score should be 4. \\n\\nBut let me check']\n",

The reviewer points out that the spurious features in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are similar to backdoor triggers described in Chen et al. (2017) and Gu et al. (2019). They mention that these triggers are artificial patterns appearing rarely in training data and note that such patterns can significantly impact models. \\n\\nNow, applying the actionability criteria.

That makes the action implicit.\\n\\nNext, the concrete vs. vague aspect. If the action is to address the similarity, the reviewer hasn\\'t specified how. They might need to suggest a comparison, mention limitations, or adjust their experiments. But without explicit instructions on how to do this, the action is vague.

They both are some artificial patterns that only appear a few times in the training set. For example, Chen et al. (2017) use random noise patterns. Gu et al.

It is well-known that a few training examples with such triggers (rare spurious examples in this paper) would have a large impact on the trained model.  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer highlights a similarity between the paper’s spurious features and backdoor triggers described in prior work (Chen et al., Gu et al.). While this observation implies that the authors should address or clarify this connection (e.g., by discussing the implications, comparing methodologies, or justifying distinctions), the comment does not explicitly state what action the authors should take. The action (e.g., revising the methodology, adding a comparison, or acknowledging limitations) must be inferred. Additionally, the reviewer does not specify *how* the authors should address this similarity (e.g., through experiments, literature review, or theoretical analysis). The mention of existing studies provides context but lacks concrete guidance on implementation.  \\n\\n**Score:** 2  \\n**Reasoning:**  \\n- **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The action is implicit. The reviewer points out a similarity but does not explicitly instruct the authors to modify their work.  \\n- **Concrete vs. Vague:** The action is vague. While the reviewer references prior work, they do not specify the exact steps or changes needed to address the similarity. The authors must deduce the required action (e.g., comparing their spurious features to backdoor triggers in the discussion, revising experiments, or citing relevant literature), but the \"how\" remains unclear.  \\n\\nThis comment is borderline actionable because it identifies a critical observation but fails to provide actionable steps for improvement.

The authors should make clear the distinction of when the proposed method is trained using only weak supervision and when it is semi-supervised trained. For instance, in Table 1, I think the proposed framework row refers to the semi-supervised version of the method, thus the authors should rename the column to ‘Fully supervised’ from ‘Supervised’. Maybe a better idea is to specify the data used to train ALL the parts of each model and have two big columns ‘Mixture training data’ and ‘Single source data’ which will make it much more prevalent of what is which.  \\n\\n**rationale:**  \\nThe review comment explicitly instructs the authors to clarify the distinction between weak supervision and semi-supervised training in Table 1. It provides concrete steps, such as renaming a column (\"Supervised\" → \"Fully supervised\") and restructuring columns into \"Mixture training data\" and \"Single source data.\" These suggestions are direct and specific, leaving no ambiguity about how to modify the table. The reviewer also emphasizes the need to specify the training data for all model components, ensuring clarity. The actions are both explicit and concrete, enabling the authors to implement the changes precisely.  \\n\\n**', '** 5  \\n\\n**Explanation:**  \\nThis comment is **highly actionable** (', ' 5). The reviewer provides explicit instructions (e.g., renaming columns, restructuring table headers) and concrete details (e.g., specifying \"Mixture training data\" vs. \"Single source data\"). The authors can follow these steps directly to improve the clarity of their table. The suggestions are unambiguous and actionable without requiring further inference.']\n",

The two main aspects are whether the action is explicit or implicit and concrete or vague. \\n\\nLooking at the review point, the reviewer is pointing out that the contributions are incremental and the method doesn\\'t differentiate well from existing ones. But do they provide any specific action for the authors to take? The comment seems more like a critique without suggesting a direct action. The authors might need to enhance their contributions or better highlight differences, but the reviewer doesn\\'t specify how. \\n\\nIs the action explicit? The reviewer is stating an issue but not giving a direct instruction. So it\\'s implicit. Now, is the action concrete? The reviewer says \"it performs very similarly in practice,\" so maybe the authors should improve the method\\'s performance or provide a better analysis. But how? The comment doesn\\'t say. They could suggest adding more experiments, comparing in different scenarios, or emphasizing unique aspects, but the reviewer doesn\\'t mention these steps. \\n\\nSince the action isn\\'t clearly stated and the steps to address it are vague, this might fall into the lower scores. Comparing to examples in the scale, this seems similar to the \"somewhat actionable\" (score 3) where the action is explicit but vague. Wait, no. Wait, the examples for 3 are like \"You should address the lack of technical novelty\" which is explicit but vague. Here, the reviewer is pointing out the issue but not directly telling them to address it. Maybe it\\'s implicit? \\n\\nAlternatively, the reviewer\\'s statement that the contributions are small could imply the authors need to better justify or enhance their contributions. But the exact steps are unclear. So maybe it\\'s implicit and vague, making it a 2 (borderline actionable). \\n\\nWait, the borderline actionable (score 2) is when the action is implicit and vague. The somewhat actionable (3) is explicit but vague. Since the reviewer isn\\'t explicitly telling the authors to do something, like \"you should compare more\" or \"you should highlight differences,\" but just states the problem, it\\'s more implicit. So score 2? \\n\\nAlternatively, the reviewer\\'s mention that it\\'s hard to differentiate might imply the authors should provide a better analysis or experiments to show differences. But without specifics, it\\'s still vague. So yes, I think score 2 is appropriate here. The action is implied but the method to address it isn\\'t clear.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:** The review point critiques the paper\\'s contributions as incremental and difficult to differentiate from prior work (NCNet and Sparse NCNet), suggesting that the improvements are primarily engineering. However, the comment does not provide explicit instructions or concrete steps for the authors to address this issue. While the reviewer implies that the authors need to better highlight or enhance their contributions (e.g., by improving performance or distinguishing their method more clearly), the feedback lacks specificity on *how* to achieve this. The action required is inferred but remains vague, as the reviewer does not suggest adding specific experiments, modifying the methodology, or revising the analysis.

The comment says, \"- \\'semantic\\' segmentation is not low-level since the categories are specified for each pixel so the statements about semantic segmentation being a low-level cue should be removed from the paper.\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out where this fits on the actionability scale. The key here is understanding the two criteria: explicit vs implicit and concrete vs vague. \\n\\nStarting with explicit vs implicit. The reviewer is directly telling the authors to remove specific statements. They\\'re pointing out that the current description of semantic segmentation as a low-level cue is incorrect because semantic segmentation actually involves categorizing each pixel into meaningful categories, which is a higher-level task. The action here is explicit: \"should be removed from the paper.\" There\\'s no ambiguity here; the authors know exactly what they need to do—take out those statements.\\n\\nNow, looking at concrete vs vague. The reviewer specifies exactly what the problem is (calling semantic segmentation low-level) and what needs to be done (remove the statements). They even explain why it\\'s incorrect, which helps the authors understand the reasoning. The authors can go through their paper, find all instances where semantic segmentation is referred to as a low-level cue, and delete or revise those parts.

A 3 would be explicit but vague, but this isn\\'t vague. The reviewer gives a clear reason and exact action. \\n\\nSo, this seems like a 5. The only possible hesitation might be if the reviewer didn\\'t specify where those statements are, but the authors can search their own paper for instances of \"low-level\" in the context of semantic segmentation. Since the instruction is direct and the required action is clear, it\\'s highly actionable.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review comment explicitly states that the term \"semantic segmentation\" should not be described as a \"low-level cue\" and instructs the authors to remove these statements from the paper. The reasoning is clear: semantic segmentation involves pixel-level categorization into meaningful classes, which is inherently a high-level task. The action (removing the incorrect statements) is **explicit**, and the rationale provides sufficient context for the authors to understand why the change is necessary.

There is no ambiguity about what needs to be done or how to do it.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reasoning:** This comment is **highly actionable** because it provides an explicit directive (\"should be removed\") paired with a clear explanation of why the current phrasing is incorrect.

The difference is that in the 5 example, the reviewer provides a specific direction (type-level accuracies, varying frequencies), whereas here it\\'s more general. \\n\\nSo maybe it\\'s a 4? Wait, but the action is explicit. Let me check the scale again. \\n\\nThe scale says:\\n\\n- 5: Explicit and concrete. \\n\\n- 4: Implicit but concrete. \\n\\nWait, the example for 4: \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y that other people have been comparing their results to.\" That\\'s implicit (the action is to add those baselines, which is inferred) but concrete because they specify X and Y. \\n\\nIn our case, the action is explicit (the reviewer says \"lacks description of how the idea was evaluated and what was the outcome\") so it\\'s explicit. The required action is explicit, and the components (evaluation and outcome) are concrete. Therefore, it should be a 5. \\n\\nWait but the example for 3 is \"You should address the lack of technical novelty in this paper.\" which is explicit but vague (so 3). \\n\\nIn our case, the action is explicit and the required elements are clear (add evaluation and outcome). So it\\'s more like the 5 example where the action is explicit and the required steps are clear. \\n\\nTherefore, I think this should be a 5. However, maybe there\\'s a nuance. The reviewer is saying the abstract lacks those parts, so the action is to add them. The how is up to the authors, but the what is clear. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s a 4. Let me see another example. \\n\\nLooking at the example for 4: \"Some items in Table 2 and Table 3 have spaces between accuracy and standard deviation, and some items don\\'t, which affects beauty.\" That\\'s explicit (directly stating the problem) and concrete (they know exactly what to fix). So that was a 5. \\n\\nWait, the example given for 5 is the one about bold entries in the table. \\n\\nWait the example for 5 is \"The number of BARTword + text smoothing and BARTspan + text smoothing on SST-2 in Table 3 should NOT be in bold as they cause degeneration of the performance.\" That\\'s explicit and concrete, so 5. \\n\\nAnother example for 5: \"I suggest the authors have the paper reviewed by a native English speaker.\" \\n\\nIn our case, the comment is telling the authors to add evaluation and outcome. The action is explicit and the required elements are clear. So that\\'s a 5. \\n\\nTherefore, I think the score should be 5. However, maybe the minor language issues part is a bit vague, but that\\'s separate. The main part is about the abstract content. \\n\\nWait the user\\'s example for score 4 was when the action is implicit but concrete. Since this is explicit, it\\'s better. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the reviewer didn\\'t specify exactly how to present the evaluation and outcome.

This may also help with comparative analysis of deterministic and stochastic methods.  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe comment suggests conducting an epoch-wise analysis in finite sum settings to gain insights into optimization algorithms. It explicitly mentions potential areas of investigation, such as the effects of batch size, sampling strategies, and comparisons between deterministic and stochastic methods. While the phrasing is tentative (\"I think,\" \"could help,\" \"may enable\"), the reviewer provides concrete examples of what the analysis could explore. The action is implicit but the suggested directions (e.g., batch size, sampling strategies) are specific enough to guide the authors toward designing experiments. However, the comment does not explicitly state that the authors *must* perform these analyses or specify exact methodologies, leaving some ambiguity about implementation details.  \\n\\n**Score:** 4  \\n**Reasoning:**  \\nThe action is implicit (suggested as a possibility) but the examples provided (e.g., batch size, sampling strategies, deterministic vs. stochastic comparisons) make the implementation concrete. Authors can infer actionable steps (e.g., track epoch-wise performance, vary batch sizes, test sampling strategies, compare methods) even though the instruction is not direct. This aligns with the \"Mostly Actionable\" category, where the inferred action is paired with concrete guidance.']\n",
      "[\"Okay, let's tackle this review point. The reviewer is saying that the paper's contribution is incremental, combining GraphRAG and GraphCare, and missing key baselines like MedRetriever and KGRAG. \\n\\nFirst, I need to check the aspect of Actionability. The two main criteria are Explicit vs. Implicit and Concrete vs. Vague. \\n\\nThe reviewer points out that the contribution is incremental by combining existing works. They also mention that important baselines aren't cited, specifically naming MedRetriever and KGRAG. \\n\\nSo, the action here is for the authors to address the incremental nature and include those baselines. The reviewer explicitly states that the contribution is a combination of existing methods, which implies the authors should either clarify their novel contribution or add more substantial improvements. Also, the missing baselines are named, so the authors know exactly which ones to include. \\n\\nIs the action explicit? The reviewer directly says the contribution is incremental and lists specific baselines. That's explicit. \\n\\nIs it concrete? The reviewer tells them to cite MedRetriever and KGRAG, which is a clear action. For the contribution being incremental, they might need to either argue why their combination is novel or enhance their approach. That part is a bit more implicit, but since the reviewer suggests adding those baselines, which would help in comparison, it's somewhat concrete. \\n\\nHowever, the part about the contribution being incremental is a bit vague in terms of how to fix it. The authors might need to either reframe their contribution or add more innovations, but the reviewer doesn't specify how. The baseline part is explicit and concrete. \\n\\nSo, the comment has both explicit and implicit elements. The explicit part (adding specific baselines) is concrete. The contribution part is more of a critique but doesn't give a direct action except to address it through better justification or additional work. \\n\\nLooking at the scale, since part of the comment is explicit and concrete (adding specific baselines), but another part is more of a critique without clear steps, maybe it's a 3 or 4. \\n\\nWait, the Actionability Scale says that if the action is implicit but the implementation is concrete, it's a 4. Here, the main action (adding those baselines) is explicit and concrete. The other part (incremental contribution) is more of a problem statement but the action would be to either argue better or add more work, which is less concrete. \\n\\nBut since the reviewer explicitly names the baselines to include, that's a clear actionable item. The rest might be more about the authors' response, but the main actionable part is concrete. So maybe this is a 4? Or since part is explicit and concrete, and part is implicit, maybe it's a 3? \\n\\nHmm. Let me check the examples. For example, the score 4 example mentions relevant baselines like X and Y, which is similar here (MedRetriever and KGRAG). The reviewer is pointing out that those are missing, so the action is to include them. That's explicit and concrete. \\n\\nThe other part about the contribution being incremental is more of a critique, but the reviewer is saying that the authors need to address that. However, how exactly? They might need to either better explain the novelty or add more to the method. Since that part is more implicit, but the baseline part is explicit and concrete, the overall score would be 4. \\n\\nSo, the main action is explicit and concrete (add specific baselines), which makes it a 4. The other part is more of a critique without clear action, but the main actionable part is strong enough for a 4.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer explicitly points out that the paper's contribution is incremental, combining existing methods (GraphRAG and GraphCare), and identifies specific missing baselines (MedRetriever [2], KGRAG [3]). While the critique of the contribution being incremental is implicit and lacks concrete guidance on how to address it, the explicit instruction to include the named baselines is clear and actionable. The authors know precisely which baselines to add (MedRetriever and KGRAG) and can implement this change directly. The critique about incremental contribution requires the authors to either better justify their novelty or enhance their approach, but this part remains vague.

The discussion part is a bit more about the three transformation methods, but the reviewer doesn\\'t specify which three exactly. Wait, the review says \"three ways of transforming the high-dimensional data to low-dimensional latent space.\" The authors might already be using three methods, so the reviewer wants a discussion on those. Since the methods are likely already in the paper, the authors can identify which ones they are and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. \\n\\nThe reviewer also mentions that this discussion should explain why some are more suitable for certain tasks/datasets.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the actionability of the comment provided. First, I need to recall the criteria for actionability: explicit vs implicit and concrete vs vague. The goal is to see if the review gives clear, actionable steps for the authors to improve their draft.\\n\\nLooking at the review point: The reviewer mentions two main issues. First, the improvement over previous methods is small (0.2%-1%). Second, the results in Table 1 and Figure 5 don\\'t report mean and standard deviation, making it hard to assess statistical significance. The reviewer then suggests repeating experiments and conducting statistical significance analysis. Finally, they recommend rejecting the paper due to limited novelty and marginal improvement.\\n\\nBreaking it down: The first part about the small improvement and missing stats is a criticism, but the actionable part comes in the suggestion to repeat experiments and do statistical analysis. The reviewer explicitly tells the authors to take those actions. That\\'s an explicit action. Now, is it concrete? The suggestion to repeat experiments is a bit vague—how many times? Under what conditions? But the statistical significance analysis is more concrete; they know they need to calculate p-values or confidence intervals. However, the part about the marginal improvement and lack of novelty leads to a rejection suggestion. But the actionability is about the suggestions to improve, not the decision to reject. \\n\\nWait, the rejection is the reviewer\\'s conclusion, but the actionable part is the advice to repeat experiments and do statistical tests. The first part about the improvement being small is just a critique, but the suggestion to repeat and analyze is explicit. However, \"repeat the experiments\" might be a bit vague. How many times? Which experiments? The reviewer doesn\\'t specify, so that part is a bit vague. The statistical significance part is more concrete. But the main action is clear: add mean/std dev and do statistical tests. \\n\\nSo the action is explicit (they said \"I will suggest to...\"), but the \"repeat experiments\" is a bit vague. The statistical analysis part is concrete. The part about novelty and marginal improvement might not be actionable because it\\'s more of a judgment. The key actionable items are the experiments and stats. Since the reviewer tells them exactly what to do (report mean/SD and do significance analysis), that\\'s explicit and concrete. The first part about improvement being small is just a critique but not an action. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 4 or 5. Let me check the scale. A 5 is explicit and concrete. The suggestion to repeat experiments is a bit vague, but the statistical analysis is concrete. The reviewer says \"conduct statistical significance analysis\", which is specific. The missing mean and SD in tables is a concrete issue to fix. So the main actions are explicit and concrete. The part about repeating experiments might be a bit vague, but the main actionable items are clear. So maybe a 4 or 5. \\n\\nWait, the example for 5 includes \"suggest to look at type-level accuracies\" which is explicit and concrete.

Hmm. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the reviewer\\'s suggestion is explicit but the \"repeat experiments\" is not as concrete. The authors know to add mean/SD and do significance tests, which are concrete steps. The rest is critique. So this is explicit and concrete. So score 5?

Here, adding mean/SD and statistical tests are similar. The reviewer\\'s main actionable points are explicit and concrete. The part about repeating experiments might be redundant because adding the stats can be done without repeating, but maybe they need to rerun to get the SD. Either way, the key is that the reviewer tells them to do specific things. \\n\\nTherefore, I think this is a 5.

The reviewer is asking specific questions, so the action here would be for the authors to clarify these points in their paper. \\n\\nLooking at the explicit vs. implicit criteria: the reviewer is directly asking questions, which implies that the authors should add this information.

The action here would be for the authors to update their related work section by including newer studies. But does the comment explicitly tell them to do that? It says \"More recent works should be included,\" which is pretty direct. So that\\'s an explicit action. But how exactly should they do it?

The second part (ImageNet experiments) is explicit and concrete because the dataset is named. \\n\\nSo overall, the actions are explicit. The concreteness is mixed. The first part is a bit vague (which recent works?), the second is concrete (ImageNet is specified). \\n\\nLooking at the scale\\'s criteria for score 4: \\n\\nIf the action is explicit but the concreteness is mixed, maybe the second part (ImageNet) is concrete, so the overall might lean towards 4. \\n\\nAlternatively, since part of the comment is explicit and concrete (ImageNet) and part is explicit but vague (recent works), perhaps the average is 4. \\n\\nWait the examples for score 4 include:\\n\\n- \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y...\" which is implicit (since it\\'s stating that baselines exist but not explicitly telling to include them?), but actually in the example, the action is inferred but the implementation is concrete. \\n\\nWait the example for 4 says \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y that other people have been comparing their results to.\" So the action is to compare to X and Y, which is implicit (the reviewer says \"there are baselines\", so the action is to include them, but it\\'s stated implicitly. But the concreteness is there because they mention X and Y. \\n\\nIn our case, the first part says \"more recent works should be included\"—explicit action but the how (which ones) is vague. The second part is explicit and concrete (ImageNet). \\n\\nHmm. The first part\\'s action is explicit but the implementation is vague (since the reviewer doesn\\'t say which works to include). The second part is explicit and concrete. \\n\\nSo maybe each part can be considered. Since the review point combines two separate suggestions, perhaps the overall score would be 4 because one part is explicit and concrete (ImageNet), and the other is explicit but vague (recent works). Since the scale\\'s highest score requires both explicit and concrete, but here it\\'s a mix, maybe 4 is appropriate. \\n\\nAlternatively, the first part is explicit but vague, so that would be a 3, and the second part is explicit and concrete (5?), but since they are combined in one review point, perhaps the average. \\n\\nWait the scale\\'s 3 is explicit but vague. 4 is implicit but concrete. Wait, no:\\n\\nWait the definitions again:\\n\\nScore 3: Explicit action but vague on how to execute it.\\n\\nScore 4: Implicit action but concrete on how to implement.\\n\\nIn this case, the actions are explicit. The first part (recent works) is explicit but vague (how to choose which ones). The second (ImageNet) is explicit and concrete. \\n\\nSo for the second part, it\\'s explicit and concrete, which would be a 5. But the first part is explicit and vague (so 3). Since the review point combines both, maybe the overall is a 4? \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the entire review point\\'s actionability is the higher of the two. Since part of it is 5 (ImageNet) and part is 3 (recent works), perhaps the overall is 4. \\n\\nAlternatively, since both are explicit but one is concrete and one is vague, perhaps it\\'s a 4. Because the explicit actions are there, but the concreteness is mixed. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the overall is 4 because the main actions are explicit, and the ImageNet part is concrete, which is a key part. \\n\\nSo I think the score here should be 4. \\n\\nWait']\n",

The key points are whether the action is explicit or implicit and concrete or vague. The reviewer explicitly states that the authors should train a discriminator on the model's generations.

The action is explicit because they're telling the authors exactly what to do. However, the concreteness comes into play here. The reviewer explains the method and even contrasts it with another figure, which gives context. They also warn about a possible pitfall, which might help the authors design their experiment better. \\n\\nIs the action concrete? The reviewer specifies the method (training a discriminator on generations from the learned model), references a figure for example, and mentions the difference from another part of the paper.

This isn't just a vague suggestion; it's a clear action with specific points to consider. \\n\\nSo, the action is explicit and the details provided make it concrete.

For evaluation, since the claim of this paper is to reduce exposure bias, training a discriminator on generations from the learned model is needed to confirm if it is the case, in a way similar to Figure 1.

They also highlight a critical distinction from Figure 4, emphasizing that co-adaptation between the discriminator and generator during training could lead to local optima. This provides both a clear action (train the discriminator as in Figure 1 but avoid co-adaptation pitfalls) and concrete guidance on how to execute it (e.g., ensuring the discriminator is not co-trained in a way that causes suboptimal results).

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The comment says, \"The method seems more involved than it needs to be. One would suspect that there is an underlying, simpler principle that is propelling the quality gains.\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actionability based on the criteria given. The two main aspects are whether the action is explicit or implicit and concrete or vague. \\n\\nStarting with explicit vs. implicit. The reviewer is pointing out that the method is overly complex and suggests there might be a simpler principle behind the improvements. But do they give a direct action? They don\\'t explicitly tell the authors to simplify the method or identify the underlying principle. Instead, they\\'re implying that the authors should look for a simpler approach. So this is implicit because the action isn\\'t directly stated.\\n\\nNext, concrete vs. vague. Even if the action is to simplify, the comment doesn\\'t specify how to do that. The reviewer mentions \"an underlying, simpler principle\" but doesn\\'t provide any clues about what that principle might be or how to find it. The authors would have to figure out on their own what the simpler approach could be, which is not straightforward. This makes the action vague because there\\'s no clear path provided.\\n\\nConsidering the importance of being concrete, since the reviewer\\'s suggestion lacks specific steps or methods to achieve simplification, it\\'s hard for the authors to know exactly how to proceed. They might need to re-examine their entire method, which is a broad task without guidance. \\n\\nThe comment is somewhat helpful because it points out complexity as an issue, but the lack of concrete steps means the authors might struggle to implement changes effectively. It\\'s not as bad as a 1 because there\\'s a hint of a direction (simplify), but it\\'s not enough to be a 3 or higher. Since it\\'s implicit and vague, it falls into the borderline actionable category, which is a score of 2. \\n\\nWait, but let me check the examples again. The score 2 examples include things like \"I wonder what would happen if you used another dataset\" which is a question but still borderline. This comment is similar in that it\\'s suggesting a possible underlying principle but not how to find it. So yes, score 2 makes sense here.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer suggests that the method might be overly complex and hints at a simpler underlying principle driving the improvements. However, the comment does not explicitly instruct the authors to simplify the method, identify the principle, or provide concrete steps for doing so. The action (simplifying the method or uncovering the principle) must be inferred, and the vagueness of \"underlying, simpler principle\" leaves authors without clear direction on how to achieve this. While the feedback points to a potential issue, the lack of actionable steps or specificity limits its utility for direct improvements.  \\n\\n**Score:** 2  \\n**Reasoning:** The comment is implicitly stating that the method could be simplified but remains vague about how to do so. It falls into the \"borderline actionable\" category because the action is inferred but lacks concrete guidance for implementation. Authors may struggle to determine the exact steps needed to address the complexity, making it difficult to apply the feedback effectively.']\n",

Let\\'s break down the components.\\n\\nThe reviewer is pointing out that existing methods in person re-ID are either two-step (using pedestrian detectors first) or end-to-end approaches that combine detection and re-ID, citing reference [5].

Comparing to the examples given in the scale: \\n\\n- A score of 2 (Borderline Actionable) is when the action can be inferred but is vague. For instance, \"I wonder what would happen if you used another dataset.\" Here, the reviewer isn\\'t even suggesting a question; they\\'re just stating existing methods. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the reviewer is implying that the authors didn\\'t discuss these existing approaches adequately. So the action would be \"discuss existing methods properly.\" But that\\'s still vague. The authors might need to add a literature review section comparing their method to two-step and end-to-end methods. However, without explicit instructions on how or where, it\\'s still vague. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the authors\\' paper didn\\'t mention these categories, the reviewer is pointing out a gap. The action is to address that gap.

The authors know they need to address existing methods but aren\\'t told exactly how. Therefore, this might be a 2 (Borderline Actionable) because the action is inferred but vague. \\n\\nWait, but looking at the example for score 4 (Mostly Actionable), which is implicit but concrete. The example was \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y...\" which implies adding those baselines.

Here, the action isn\\'t even explicit. The reviewer is just stating existing methods, so maybe it\\'s even lower. \\n\\nWait, maybe the reviewer is suggesting that the authors should mention both categories in their paper. The action is to include this information. But that\\'s still vague. The authors know they should discuss existing methods but not how exactly. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe this is a 1 (Unactionable) because it\\'s just a factual statement without any guidance. But the fact that existing methods are categorized this way could imply that the authors need to discuss these categories in their related work. That gives a direction, so it\\'s not entirely unactionable. \\n\\nHmm. The line between 1 and 2 here is tricky. The reviewer\\'s comment is pointing out a gap (if the authors didn\\'t mention these categories), so the action is to address that gap. The authors can infer that they need to include this in their related work or methodology. But the comment doesn\\'t say \"you should include a discussion of end-to-end methods\" or \"you should compare with end-to-end approaches.\" It\\'s just stating that such methods exist. \\n\\nIn that case, the action is very implicit and vague. The authors might not know exactly where to incorporate this information or how detailed it should be. Since the comment lacks explicit instructions and concrete steps, it might be a 2 (Borderline Actionable). \\n\\nAlternatively, if the authors are expected to mention these categories, then the action is somewhat clear but still vague in execution. So maybe a 3? \\n\\nWait, the example for score 3 is \"You should address the lack of technical novelty...\" which is explicit but vague. Here, the action is implicit. So maybe 2 is better. \\n\\nI think the key is that the comment is pointing out existing methods but not telling the authors what to do about it.

While the authors might infer that they need to discuss these methodological distinctions, the comment lacks concrete guidance on *how* or *where* to incorporate this information (e.g., in the related work section, methodology, or experiments).

Alternatively, they might need to present additional experiments or statistical tests to back up their hypothesis.\\n\\nThe references given (Hu et al. on SE networks and Luo et al. on receptive fields) might be relevant for explaining why reduced class selectivity indicates better representations. The authors could use these papers to frame their analysis differently or provide theoretical backing. \\n\\nThe action is somewhat explicit in the sense that the reviewer is asking for a better explanation, but the method of achieving that isn\\'t detailed.

The reviewer’s question (“What is the reason...”) explicitly calls for a clearer explanation but does not dictate the exact steps to take. However, the specificity of the cited references and the targeted section (lines 128–149) gives the authors a concrete direction to address the gap.

They specifically ask the authors to report classification accuracy on ImageNet and suggest providing theoretical justifications.\\n\\nFirst, I need to assess the actionability based on the criteria given. Actionability is about whether the authors can take clear, concrete steps based on the comment. The two main aspects are Explicit vs. Implicit and Concrete vs. Vague.\\n\\nLooking at the first part: the reviewer is pointing out a potential issue with the model\\'s performance. The direct actions suggested here are to \"report the classification accuracy on ImageNet data\" and \"provide theoretical justifications.\" These are explicit actions because they tell the authors exactly what to do. Reporting accuracy is straightforward—run the model on ImageNet and include the results. Theoretical justifications might be a bit more open-ended, but the reviewer is asking for them, so the authors know they need to address this aspect.\\n\\nThe second part of the comment is a bit more implicit. The reviewer expresses doubt about the model\\'s performance and mentions the trade-off between OOD detection and classification accuracy. However, the explicit requests (reporting accuracy and theory) make the actionable parts clear. The rest is more of a concern that the authors can address by fulfilling those explicit requests.\\n\\nNow, checking the concrete vs. vague. Reporting ImageNet accuracy is very concrete—there\\'s no ambiguity here. Theoretical justifications are a bit vague in terms of what exactly is needed, but the reviewer is asking for them, so the authors know they need to provide some form of theoretical backing, even if the specifics aren\\'t spelled out. However, since the main action (reporting accuracy) is concrete and explicit, that might tip the score higher.\\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scale:\\n\\n- A score of 5 requires explicit and concrete actions. The request to report ImageNet accuracy is explicit and concrete. The theoretical part is explicit but maybe a bit vague, but the main action is clear.\\n\\n- A 4 would be implicit but concrete. But here, the actions are explicit. Theoretical justifications are still a bit vague but the primary action is clear.\\n\\nWait, the theoretical part is also an explicit request. The reviewer says \"some theoretical justifications, if possible, would be great for the issue.\" So even that is an explicit suggestion. The authors can take that as a direct request to include theoretical analysis. \\n\\nTherefore, both parts are explicit and concrete. The first action (report accuracy) is very concrete. The second (theoretical) is also explicit, even if the exact form isn\\'t specified.

Another example: \"analyze how the accuracies vary with frequencies of entities\" is explicit and concrete.\\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer is explicitly telling the authors to report specific numbers (ImageNet accuracy) and to provide theoretical justifications. Both are clear actions. The theoretical part might be a bit open-ended, but it\\'s still a direct request. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5. The actions are explicit and concrete. The authors know exactly what to do: run the model on ImageNet and add those results, and include some theoretical justifications in the paper. The reviewer even mentions the specific dataset (ImageNet), so that\\'s concrete. \\n\\nThe only possible point of vagueness is the theoretical part, but since it\\'s still an explicit request, even if the method isn\\'t specified, it\\'s still actionable.

The authors propose a new classification network, but I a bit doubt that its classification error is universally as good as the standard softmax network. It is a bit dangerous to build a new model for better detecting out-of-distribution samples, while losing its classification accuracy. Could the authors report the classification accuracy of the proposed classifier on ImageNet data? Some theoretical justifications, if possible, would be great for the issue.\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer explicitly requests two concrete actions: (1) **report the classification accuracy of the proposed classifier on ImageNet data** and (2) **provide theoretical justifications** for the model’s performance trade-offs. These actions are direct and unambiguous. The first action specifies exactly what data (ImageNet) and metric (classification accuracy) should be reported, leaving no room for ambiguity. The second action, while slightly open-ended, is still explicit in its demand for theoretical support.

However, they don\\'t specify exactly how to set up the ablation (e.g., which configurations to test, specific metrics to use). The authors know they need to test this, but the exact steps might require some inference. \\n\\nThe key is whether the action is clear enough.

However, the comment does not explicitly state what action the authors should take (e.g., modifying the opponent\\'s objective, adding experiments where opponents optimize the proposed payoff, or clarifying the rationale for the current setup).

They also mention that if the result has implications for low-rank matrix factorization, those should be explicitly discussed.\\n\\nFirst, I need to break down the components here. The reviewer is pointing out a potential disconnect between the motivation presented in the introduction and the main results of the paper. The motivation section is discussing low-rank factorization, but the main contribution is about polytopes. The reviewer is suggesting that either the motivation is not relevant or that the implications for low-rank factorization, if any, need to be clearly addressed.\\n\\nNow, evaluating actionability based on the criteria. The two main aspects are explicit vs. implicit and concrete vs. vague. \\n\\nStarting with explicit vs. implicit: The reviewer is making a suggestion here. They are pointing out that the motivation might be unnecessary and are asking for explicit discussion if there are implications. The action here is somewhat implicit. The reviewer isn\\'t directly telling the authors to remove the motivation section, but they are implying that it might not be necessary. However, the second part about discussing implications if they exist is more of a suggestion. The authors could interpret this as needing to either remove the low-rank motivation or expand on its connection to polytopes. \\n\\nNext, concrete vs. vague: The reviewer\\'s feedback is somewhat concrete because they specify that if there are implications for low-rank factorization, they should be discussed. However, the first part about the motivation being unnecessary is a bit vague in terms of what exactly to do. The authors might need to decide whether to remove that part or reframe it. The second part is more concrete because it gives a clear direction: if there\\'s a connection, discuss it explicitly. \\n\\nPutting this together, the reviewer is providing an actionable point but with some vagueness. The authors know they need to address the relevance of the low-rank factorization motivation in the introduction. They might need to either remove it, revise it to align better with the main results, or add explicit discussion of its implications. However, the exact steps aren\\'t spelled out. The reviewer is pointing out a potential issue but not giving a step-by-step solution. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scale: \\n\\n- A score of 4 (mostly actionable) would be if the action is implicit but the how is concrete. Here, the reviewer\\'s suggestion is implicit (they don\\'t explicitly say \"remove this section\") but the concrete part is the request to discuss implications if they exist. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s a 3 (somewhat actionable) because the first part is explicit but vague (they say \"unnecessary\" but don\\'t say how to fix it beyond possibly removing it). The second part is explicit and concrete. \\n\\nWait, the first part says the motivation is unnecessary, so the action could be inferred as removing it or revising it. The second part says if there are implications, discuss them. The reviewer is giving two possible actions here. \\n\\nHmm, but the problem is the first part is a bit of a critique without a direct action. The second part is a conditional action. So maybe it\\'s a mix. \\n\\nLooking at the examples for score 4: \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y that other people have been comparing their results to.\" That\\'s implicit but concrete. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer is pointing out that the motivation may not be relevant, which could be seen as an implicit suggestion to remove or revise it. The second part is a conditional explicit suggestion. \\n\\nOverall, the action is somewhat implicit but the second part is more concrete. The authors can take action by either revising the motivation section to align better with the main results (polytopes) or adding explicit discussion on low-rank implications if applicable. \\n\\nTherefore, this seems to fit into a 4 (mostly actionable) because the action can be inferred, and the second part provides a concrete direction. The first part\\'s action (removing or revising the motivation) is implicit but still actionable. \\n\\nAlternatively, if the first part is seen as vague (they don\\'t say how to fix the motivation being unnecessary), then maybe it\\'s a 3. But since the second part gives a concrete direction (discuss implications if present), maybe it\\'s a 4. \\n\\nThe examples for 4 include \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y...\" which is similar to pointing out a missing component (here, discussion of implications if they exist). \\n\\nSo I think the score here would be 4.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Review Point:**  \\n3) I found the motivation in the introduction with the low-rank factorization unnecessary given that the main result is about polytopes. If the result has implications for low-rank matrix factorization I would like to see them explicitly discussed.  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer identifies a potential misalignment between the motivation (focused on low-rank factorization) and the main results (polytopes). They implicitly suggest revising or removing the low-rank motivation section unless there is a clear connection. Additionally, they explicitly request that any implications of the results for low-rank matrix factorization should be explicitly discussed if they exist.  \\n\\nWhile the first part of the comment (\"unnecessary\") is implicit and somewhat vague in terms of how to address it (e.g., remove, reframe, or retain with justification), the second part (\"explicitly discussed\") provides a concrete direction. The authors can infer that they should either revise the motivation to align with the main results or clarify the relevance of low-rank factorization to polytopes. The explicit request to discuss implications if they exist adds concreteness to the actionable steps.  \\n\\n**Score:** 4  \\n**Explanation:**  \\nThe action is mostly actionable because it implicitly suggests revising the motivation section (actionable but inferred) and explicitly directs the authors to discuss implications of their results for low-rank factorization (concrete). While the first part lacks specificity, the second part provides a clear path forward, balancing implicit and explicit guidance. This aligns with the \"mostly actionable\" category (score 4).']\n",

The authors can immediately act on this by revising Section 4.1 to explicitly state the source of labels for each dataset, particularly for the named datasets.

The user provided a bunch of examples and their scores, so I need to apply the same criteria here.\\n\\nFirst, the review point has two parts: the first is about sensitivity to other hyper-parameters, and the second is a list of language issues. Let\\'s break them down separately.\\n\\nStarting with the first part: \"Sensitivity to other hyper-parameters.\" The reviewer is pointing out that the paper might not have explored how sensitive the results are to other hyperparameters beyond what\\'s already discussed. The action here is implicit because the reviewer isn\\'t explicitly telling the authors to add an analysis, but they\\'re suggesting that such an analysis would be beneficial. However, the comment is vague because it doesn\\'t specify which hyperparameters to examine or how to conduct the analysis. The authors would have to infer that they need to perform additional experiments or include more detailed hyperparameter sensitivity analysis.

They list specific instances like \"we typically considers\" (grammar error), \"two permutation\" (should be permutations), \"until converge\" (should be \"until convergence\" or \"until it converges\"). The reviewer also asks to proofread and fix all language problems. These are explicit and concrete actions because each example points to a specific error and the general instruction to proofread. The authors can directly address each of these typos and check the rest of the paper for similar issues. This part is definitely a 5 because the actions are explicit and concrete.\\n\\nBut the question is how to score the entire review point. Since the point combines both parts, I need to consider both aspects. The hyperparameter part is borderline actionable (2) and the language part is highly actionable (5). However, the scoring guidelines don\\'t mention combining scores, so maybe each part should be considered separately, but the user\\'s examples have separate points. Wait, looking back, the user\\'s examples each have a single review point. Here, the review point includes two separate issues. \\n\\nHmm, the instruction says to evaluate the review point as a whole. The first part about hyperparameters is vague and implicit (score 2), while the language corrections are explicit and concrete (score 5). But the overall score would need to average or prioritize the more actionable parts? Wait, no, the aspect is about the review point\\'s actionability.

Since part of the point is highly actionable (the language fixes), but the other part is borderline, how does that affect the overall score? The user\\'s examples sometimes have multiple points but are scored based on the most actionable part. For instance, in the first example with several explicit corrections, the score was 5. Here, the language part is explicit and concrete, so the overall score would be 5, because the language part is highly actionable.

Please proofread the paper and fix all language problems.\"\\n\\nAh, the structure here is that the first part is about hyperparameters, and then the second part is about language issues. So they are two separate comments within the same review point. The user\\'s instructions say to evaluate the review point as a whole. \\n\\nIn the user\\'s examples, when a review point had multiple explicit and concrete actions (like the one with line numbers and corrections), it was scored a 5.

Since part of the point is highly actionable (language fixes) and another part is less so, but the question is whether the review point as a whole is helpful. The language part is very actionable, so the overall score would be 5, because the language corrections are explicit and concrete. The hyperparameter part is a separate comment but the reviewer is pointing out two different issues. However, the presence of the highly actionable part (the language corrections) would dominate the score. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the hyperparameter part is a separate comment but in the same review point. The user\\'s examples sometimes have multiple points in one, but each part is considered. For example, the third example had several explicit actions, so it was a 5.

The authors can clearly see that they need to adjust the figure's visualization to avoid implying negative values. The suggestions are concrete because they mention specific methods (second y-axis or alternative visualization), so the authors know exactly what to try. \\n\\nLooking at the scale, since the action is explicit and the solution is concrete, this should be a high score. The examples for a 5 include things like suggesting specific metrics or methods. The reviewer here is giving a clear direction on how to fix the figure. There's no ambiguity in what needs to be done. \\n\\nSo, I think this is a 5. The reviewer not only points out the issue but also offers specific solutions, making it highly actionable.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:** The review comment explicitly identifies an issue with Figure 6C implying negative rates and provides concrete suggestions for improvement, such as using a second y-axis or a different visualization method. The action (revising the figure) is directly stated, and the proposed solutions are specific and actionable. The authors can immediately understand the problem and know exactly how to address it (e.g., adjusting the y-axis or choosing a different visualization technique). This clarity and specificity make the comment highly actionable.\\n\\n**Score:** 5\"]\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate its actionability based on the criteria provided. \\n\\nFirst, I need to break down the review point into its components. The reviewer has two main parts here. The first is a request for clarification on the empirical analysis in Figure 3. They want to know how adjustments to the amplitudes based on the Frequency Stability score affect prediction accuracy and why those adjustments improve performance. The second part is a formatting issue about equations (9) and (10) having too much spacing.\\n\\nStarting with the first part about Figure 3: The reviewer is asking for additional explanation. The action here is explicit because they\\'re directly asking the authors to provide more details. However, the question is whether this is concrete or vague. The authors know they need to explain the relationship between amplitude adjustments and accuracy, as well as the effectiveness of these adjustments. But the reviewer doesn\\'t specify exactly how to present this information—maybe through more text, additional figures, or equations. The authors have to infer the best way to clarify, so it\\'s somewhat implicit in the method of explanation but explicit in the need for clarification. \\n\\nThe second part about the equations is straightforward. The reviewer points out the spacing issue and explicitly tells the authors to adjust it. That\\'s very concrete; the authors just need to reduce the spacing between the text and equations (9) and (10). \\n\\nNow, applying the actionability scale. The first part (Figure 3 clarification) is explicit but the \"how\" and \"why\" might require the authors to deduce the best way to present the information. However, the request is clear enough that they know they need to address it, even if the exact method isn\\'t specified. The second part is explicit and concrete. \\n\\nLooking at the scale:\\n- The first part might be a 4 (mostly actionable) because the action is explicit but the method of execution (how to explain) is somewhat inferred. \\n- The second part is a 5 (highly actionable) since it\\'s a direct formatting fix. \\n\\nBut since the review point combines both, I need to consider the overall score. The majority of the point is about the empirical analysis explanation, which is mostly actionable, and the formatting is highly actionable. The combination might push it towards a 4 or 5. However, the first part\\'s requirement for the authors to explain the \\'why\\' and \\'how\\' could still be considered somewhat vague in terms of the exact steps unless they have specific guidance. Since the reviewer is asking for an explanation, the authors can address it by adding a paragraph or figure, so it\\'s actionable. \\n\\nWait, the scale says that if the action is explicit and concrete, it\\'s a 5. The first part\\'s request is explicit (they must explain), but the \\'how\\' is up to the authors. Since the reviewer is asking for an explanation, the authors can do that through text, so it\\'s concrete enough. The second part is definitely concrete. \\n\\nHmm, maybe the first part is explicit but the \\'how to execute\\' is still up to the authors. But the reviewer is asking for the explanation, so once they know they need to explain, they can do that. So maybe the first part is explicit and concrete because the action is clear (provide explanation), even if the method isn\\'t specified. \\n\\nWait, the concrete vs vague is about once the action is identified, do they know how to do it. For example, if the action is \"address dataset bias,\" that\\'s explicit but vague. Here, the action is to explain the relationship and effectiveness. The authors can write an explanation, so that\\'s concrete. The formatting is explicit and concrete. \\n\\nTherefore, the first part is explicit and concrete (5), and the second part is also 5. So the overall score should be 5. \\n\\nWait, but the first part\\'s explanation might require them to analyze or add more data? Or is it just explaining existing results? The reviewer is asking for clarification on existing analysis, so it\\'s more about explaining existing content rather than doing new work. So the authors can add text to clarify, which is straightforward. \\n\\nYes, so both parts are explicit and concrete. Therefore, the score should be 5. \\n\\nWait, but the first part\\'s second question is \"why these adjustments are effective\". The reviewer is asking for an explanation of the mechanism, which the authors might need to provide based on their understanding or add analysis. If they need to do new experiments, that\\'s different, but the request is for explanation, so they can write it. \\n\\nTherefore, the review point is highly actionable (5) because both parts are explicit and concrete.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Review Point:**  \\n* The empirical analysis in Figure 3 is confusing to the reviewer. Could the authors provide additional clarification on how the adjustments to the amplitudes of the input series and forecasting target, based on the Frequency Stability score, affect model prediction accuracy? Additionally, could you explain why these adjustments are effective in enhancing the model\\'s performance? Both Equations (9) and (10) have large spacing from the preceding text. [1] Liu, Yong, et al. \"Non-stationary transformers: Exploring the stationarity in time series forecasting.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 9881-9893.  \\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review point contains two distinct actions:  \\n1. **Clarification on Figure 3:** The reviewer explicitly asks the authors to explain how adjustments to amplitudes based on the Frequency Stability score impact prediction accuracy and why these adjustments improve performance. This is an explicit action (direct request for explanation) and concrete because the authors know exactly what to address (the relationship between amplitude adjustments, the score, and accuracy). The reviewer’s questions guide the authors to provide a clear rationale or additional analysis in the text or figures.  \\n2. **Formatting correction for Equations (9) and (10):** The reviewer directly points out the spacing issue and explicitly instructs the authors to adjust it. This is explicit and concrete, as the authors can immediately fix the formatting.  \\n\\nBoth components of the comment are **explicit** and **concrete**, leaving no ambiguity about the required actions. The authors can address the empirical analysis by revising the explanation around Figure 3 and editing the equations’ formatting.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reasoning:** The comment is highly actionable because it provides explicit instructions for both content and formatting improvements. The authors know precisely what to do and how to implement the changes.']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the actionability of the comment about Figure 1. The aspect is about how helpful the comment is for the authors to improve their draft.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the actionability criteria.

The key is whether the authors can directly know what to do and how.\\n\\nThe review point says: \"Fig. 1 can also be drawn better to show the processing pipeline (prompt generation and manual check, demonstration selection with ground truth scores, and automatic scoring alongwith showing where model training is being used to optimize the selection modules.\"\\n\\nBreaking this down, the reviewer is pointing out that Figure 1 isn\\'t effectively illustrating the processing pipeline. They list specific elements that should be included: prompt generation and manual check, demonstration selection with ground truth scores, automatic scoring, and the use of model training in optimizing the selection modules. \\n\\nThe comment is explicit because it directly tells the authors to \"draw Fig. 1 better\" and specifies the components to include. The reviewer isn\\'t just implying an action but clearly stating what needs to be added or improved. \\n\\nNow, checking for concreteness. The reviewer provides concrete elements: the specific steps (prompt generation, manual check, etc.) and the need to show where model training is used. The authors can take these points and revise the figure to include each of these components. There\\'s no ambiguity here about what needs to be done. \\n\\nComparing to the scale examples, this seems similar to the score 5 example where specific actions with clear instructions are given. For instance, the example about bolding in a table was explicit and concrete, leading to a 5. Here, the reviewer is explicitly stating what parts of the pipeline should be included in the figure, which is equally concrete.\\n\\nThe only possible point of vagueness might be how exactly to arrange these elements, but the main action is clear. The authors know they need to redesign the figure to include those specific components. Therefore, this should be a 5 because it\\'s explicit and concrete.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer explicitly states that Figure 1 should be redrawn to better illustrate the processing pipeline, listing specific elements that need to be included: prompt generation and manual check, demonstration selection with ground truth scores, automatic scoring, and the integration of model training in optimizing the selection modules. The comment provides clear, concrete details about what aspects of the figure need improvement and what components must be visually represented. The authors can directly infer the required action (revise Figure 1 to include these elements) and know exactly how to implement it (by incorporating the listed components into the figure). This meets the criteria for **explicit and concrete** actionability.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reason:** The comment is explicit in stating the need to improve Figure 1 and provides concrete details about what specific elements must be added or clarified.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user provided a review comment about generated videos having significant artifacts, mentions that only some beach videos are somewhat convincing, and points out that action recognition performance is below the state-of-the-art on the UCF dataset, which uses more complex architectures. The reviewer also ends with \"Questions:\" but doesn\\'t list any specific questions.\\n\\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actionability based on the criteria given. The aspect is about how helpful the comment is for the authors to improve their draft. Let\\'s break it down.\\n\\nStarting with the first part: \"The generated videos have significant artifacts. Only some of the beach videos are kind of convincing.\" This is pointing out a problem with the quality of the generated videos. The action here would be for the authors to address the artifacts and improve the video generation. However, the comment doesn\\'t specify how to do that. The authors know there\\'s an issue but not the exact steps to fix it. So this part is somewhat actionable but vague.\\n\\nNext: \"The action recognition performance is much below the state-of-the-art on the UCF dataset, which uses more complex (deeper, also processing optic flow) architectures.\" Here, the reviewer is comparing their model\\'s performance to SOTA and mentions that the SOTA uses deeper networks and optic flow. The implication is that the authors might need to consider using similar techniques. However, the reviewer doesn\\'t explicitly tell them to do so. It\\'s an implicit suggestion. The authors could infer that they need to improve their model\\'s architecture or incorporate optic flow processing. But again, it\\'s not concrete—like which specific changes to make or how exactly to implement those changes.\\n\\nThe reviewer ends with \"Questions:\" but there are no questions listed. That might be an oversight, but as it is, there\\'s no explicit question for the authors to address. \\n\\nNow, applying the actionability scale:\\n\\n- The first part about artifacts is an implicit action (they need to fix the artifacts) but vague on how. The second part suggests that the model isn\\'t as good as SOTA because it\\'s not using deeper networks or optic flow. That\\'s an implicit suggestion to perhaps adopt those techniques. But the reviewer doesn\\'t explicitly say \"you should use deeper networks and optic flow processing.\"\\n\\nSo, according to the scale, if the action is implicit but the solution is concrete (like \"use optic flow\"), then it could be a 4. But here, the reviewer is pointing out the problem but not the solution. The authors have to infer that they need to improve their architecture or add optic flow. However, without specific steps, it\\'s still vague. \\n\\nLooking at the examples given for the scores:\\n\\nScore 2 (Borderline) is when the action is inferred but vague. Score 3 is explicit action but vague on execution. Wait, the definitions need to be checked again. \\n\\nWait, the scale says:\\n\\n2: Borderline Actionable - implicitly stated action but vague. \\n\\n3: Somewhat Actionable - explicitly states action but vague on how.\\n\\nWait, the examples for 3 include \"You should address the lack of technical novelty in this paper.\" That\\'s explicit but vague. \\n\\nIn the current review point, the first part is \"significant artifacts\" which is an implicit action (they need to fix them). The second part points to SOTA using deeper architectures and optic flow, so the action is to improve their model\\'s architecture or include optic flow. But the reviewer doesn\\'t say \"you should add optic flow processing\" or \"you should use a deeper architecture\". It\\'s more like pointing out why their performance is lower. \\n\\nTherefore, the actions here are implicit (the authors need to figure out how to reduce artifacts and improve performance by perhaps using deeper networks or optic flow). But since the reviewer doesn\\'t specify the exact steps, it\\'s vague. So this would be a borderline case (score 2). \\n\\nAlternatively, if the reviewer had said \"You should incorporate optic flow processing into your model to improve performance,\" that would be explicit and concrete (score 5). But here, it\\'s implied. \\n\\nAnother angle: The mention of \"more complex (deeper, also processing optic flow) architectures\" gives some clues, so maybe the authors can infer that adding those elements might help. But the exact implementation steps aren\\'t given. So the action is somewhat concrete but still requires the authors to figure out how to implement deeper networks or optic flow. \\n\\nHmm, maybe score 3? Because the reviewer is suggesting that the problem is due to not using those techniques, so the action is explicit (you need to improve performance by using deeper models and optic flow), but how exactly to do that is vague. Wait, but the reviewer didn\\'t explicitly state that as an action. They just pointed out the problem and the reason. \\n\\nSo, the reviewer is saying \"your performance is low because you\\'re not using these things that SOTA does.\" The action would be to adopt those techniques, but the reviewer didn\\'t explicitly say \"you should do X\". So it\\'s an implicit action. \\n\\nTherefore, the action is implicit and the solution is somewhat concrete (they can look into deeper networks and optic flow), but the exact method isn\\'t specified. \\n\\nLooking at the scale:\\n\\nScore 4 is when the action is implicit but the inferred action is concrete. For example, in one of the examples, \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y...\" which tells the authors to include those baselines. Here, the reviewer is pointing to the SOTA using deeper and optic flow, so the action is to include those in their model. But the reviewer didn\\'t explicitly say \"include deeper networks and optic flow\", so it\\'s implicit. \\n\\nThe example for score 4: \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y that other people have been comparing their results to.\" So the action is to include those baselines, which is concrete. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer is pointing out that SOTA uses deeper and optic flow, so the action is to consider those aspects. The authors can infer that they need to modify their architecture or add optic flow processing. That\\'s a concrete direction. \\n\\nWait, so maybe this is a 4?

But let me see the examples again. \\n\\nLooking at the example for 5: \"suggest the authors have the paper reviewed by a native English speaker.\" That\\'s explicit and concrete. \\n\\nAnother example: \"What will happen if you use the evaluation metric X instead of Y?\" is explicit and concrete. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer is telling them to add a discussion on the importance and selection of roots. That\\'s explicit. The authors can do that. The alternative is moving non-rooted to supplementary, which is also a clear action. \\n\\nSo yes, this is a 5. \\n\\nWait, but the initial rationale examples for 4 include \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y...\" which is implicit but concrete. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer is being explicit: \"do elaborate on why rooted patterns are important...\" so it\\'s explicit. \\n\\nTherefore, the score should be 5. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the reviewer\\'s comment is a bit more implicit in terms of the exact content? Like, they don\\'t say how to structure the discussion, but the action is clear. The authors need to explain why rootedness matters and how roots are chosen. The how of writing the discussion is up to the authors, but the action is explicit. \\n\\nIn the scale\\'s terms, the key is whether the action is explicit and concrete. Since the reviewer is telling them to add a discussion on specific points, it\\'s explicit. The \"how\" of writing is up to the authors, but the action is clear. So it\\'s a 5. \\n\\nHmm, but let me check another example. The example for 4 is \"Some items in Table 2 and Table 3 have spaces between accuracy and standard deviation...\" which is implicit? Wait no, that\\'s explicit. Wait the example given for 4 is \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y...\" which is implicit (since the action is to add those baselines, but it\\'s stated as a fact, so the action is inferred). \\n\\nAh, right. The example for 4 is \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y...\" which implies that the authors should compare to those baselines, so the action is implicit but the how is clear (add those baselines). \\n\\nIn our case, the reviewer is saying \"do elaborate on why rooted patterns...\" which is explicit. Therefore, it should be a 5. \\n\\nYes, so the score is 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n    Review Point: - The authors define rooted patterns (in a similar way to the orbit counting in GSN), but do not elaborate on why it is important for the patterns to be rooted, neither how they choose the roots. A brief discussion is expected, or if non-rooted patterns are sufficient, it might be better for the sake of exposition to discuss this case only in the supplementary material.\\n    rationale: The reviewer explicitly instructs the authors to add a discussion on the importance of']\n",

Actionability is about whether the authors can take concrete steps based on the feedback. The comment here is pointing out a potential mathematical error in the theorem\\'s proof. \\n\\nThe reviewer is being explicit about their concerns. They clearly state that the input x is incorrectly represented with two indices and that there might be a mistake in the summation\\'s result. The authors can directly address these points by checking the notation in the theorem\\'s proof. They might need to verify if x is indeed a vector and adjust the indices accordingly. For the summation part, they can recalculate to see if the result should be 1/d or d and correct it if necessary.\\n\\nThese are specific issues: notation error and a possible mathematical mistake.

Specifically, they note that even with beam search, only 77% of the results include the ground truth logical forms.

They are asking the authors to address these points, so the action here is to provide more analysis or clarification. The questions are direct, so that leans towards explicit.\\n\\nNow, concrete vs. vague. The reviewer is asking for specific information: how the system ensures correct entities/relationships when they\\'re replaced, and the percentage of correct usage without ground truth. These are specific requests. The authors need to analyze their model\\'s performance in these scenarios and report the results. The questions are clear, so the action is concrete because the authors know exactly what they need to do—conduct additional experiments or provide analysis on the mentioned metrics.\\n\\nHowever, the reviewer doesn\\'t specify exactly how to perform these analyses. For example, they don\\'t say which methods to use or how to structure the experiments. But the questions themselves are clear enough that the authors can infer the necessary steps. They might need to run tests where they replace entities and relationships, then evaluate how often the correct ones are selected. For the second part, they might need to use some form of automatic evaluation or human assessment when ground truth isn\\'t available, and report the success rate.\\n\\nThe key here is that the reviewer is pointing out a specific weakness (77% accuracy with beam search) and is asking for more detailed analysis in two specific areas. The authors can take direct action by addressing each question with data or explanations. The comments are not vague because the required actions are clear: answer the posed questions with empirical results or methodological clarifications.\\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scale:\\n\\n- A score of 5 requires explicit and concrete actions.

Then they note the authors addressed this by creating a lightweight framework and using pre-trained models for prototypes in aggregation.

It\\'s more of a statement about the current state. So, according to the scale, since there\\'s no actionable advice, it\\'s probably a 1.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate the actionability of the comment provided. The aspect is about how helpful the comment is for the authors to improve their draft.\\n\\nThe review point says: \"it would seem to me that in section 4, \\'X\\' should be a multiset (and [\\\\cal X]**n the set of multisets of size n) instead of a set, since in order the histogram to honestly represent a graph that has repeated vertex or edge labels, you need to include the multiplicities of the labels in the graph as well.\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to break down the components based on the actionability criteria. The two main criteria are Explicit vs. Implicit and Concrete vs. Vague.\\n\\nStarting with Explicit vs. Implicit: The reviewer is pointing out that the authors used a set where a multiset should be used. They explain the reason: because histograms need to account for multiplicities in labels for accurate graph representation. The suggestion here is that the authors should change \\'X\\' from a set to a multiset and adjust the notation accordingly. This seems like an explicit action because the reviewer is directly telling them what to change and why. The reviewer isn\\'t just hinting; they\\'re specifying the exact term (multiset) and the notation ([\\\\cal X]**n). So this part leans towards explicit.\\n\\nNext, Concrete vs. Vague: The reviewer gives a specific example of what needs to be done. They mention changing \\'X\\' to a multiset and adjusting the notation for the set of multisets. The reason provided (histograms needing multiplicities) also gives context on why this change is necessary. The authors can follow this instruction directly. There\\'s no ambiguity here about what action to take. They know exactly which section (Section 4) and what part of the notation to correct. This is pretty concrete.\\n\\nNow, considering the scale. The comment is explicit and concrete. The reviewer isn\\'t just saying \"fix the notation\" but specifies exactly how to fix it. The authors can go to section 4, find where \\'X\\' is defined, and change it from a set to a multiset, along with the associated notation. The explanation about histograms needing multiplicities for graphs with repeated labels gives them the rationale, so they understand the why behind the change. \\n\\nLooking at the examples provided in the actionability scale, this seems similar to the score 5 examples. For instance, the example where the reviewer points out a figure labeling error (like Figure 2 instead of 3) is a 5 because it\\'s explicit and concrete. Similarly, here, the reviewer is specifying a precise correction in notation with clear reasoning. \\n\\nWait, but let me check if there\\'s any vagueness. The reviewer mentions \"histogram to honestly represent a graph that has repeated vertex or edge labels\". They are explaining the reason, which helps the authors understand the necessity. The action is to change the definition of \\'X\\' and the notation. There\\'s no ambiguity here. The authors can implement this change without needing further clarification. \\n\\nComparing to the scale:\\n\\n- **5: Highly Actionable** has examples like correcting a figure number or suggesting a specific metric. This seems to fit here because the reviewer is giving a specific, direct instruction with clear steps.\\n\\n- **4: Mostly Actionable** is when the action is implicit but the implementation is concrete. But here, the action is explicit. The reviewer is directly stating the change needed.\\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5. The reviewer\\'s comment is explicit and concrete, providing the exact term to change, the notation adjustment, and the reasoning. The authors can act on this without guessing.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe review point explicitly identifies a specific issue in Section 4: the use of \"set\" instead of \"multiset\" for representing histograms of graphs with repeated labels. The reviewer provides concrete guidance by specifying the exact terminology to change (\"multiset\" instead of \"set\"), the corresponding notation adjustment (defining [\\\\cal X]**n as the set of multisets of size n), and the rationale (multiplicities are necessary for accurate representation). The action is direct and unambiguous, leaving the authors with clear instructions on how to correct the draft.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reasoning:**  \\nThe comment is **explicit** (directly states the needed change) and **concrete** (provides precise terminology, notation, and motivation).

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The user wants me to evaluate its actionability based on the given criteria. First, I need to recall the aspects of actionability: explicit vs. implicit and concrete vs. vague. The main goal is to see if the comment helps the authors improve their draft by providing clear, actionable steps.\\n\\nLooking at the review point, the first part says the paper is well-organized with good writing but mentions weaknesses. The feedback has three parts:\\n\\n1. \"The writing could be improved. It would be helpful to draw a table to compare different CoT prompting methods across different dimensions.\"\\n2. A question about an assumption: \"How and why shall we make an assumption that \\'questions of all the wrong demonstrations fall into the same frequent-error cluster\\'?\"\\n3. Another question about selection criteria in section 4.2: \"why do we not choose questions with more than 60 tokens and rationales with more than 5 reasoning steps?\"\\n\\nStarting with the first point: The reviewer suggests creating a table to compare CoT prompting methods. This is an explicit suggestion because they directly say \"it would be helpful to draw a table.\" The action is to create a table, which is concrete because they specify the purpose (comparing across dimensions). So this part is explicit and concrete, which would be a 5, but maybe the dimensions aren\\'t specified, so maybe a bit vague?\\n\\nSecond point: The question about the assumption. This is a clarification request. The reviewer is asking the authors to justify their assumption. While it\\'s a question, it\\'s treated as explicit if it gives a direct action. The action here is to explain or defend the assumption. The authors need to address why that assumption holds, which is concrete in that they know what to do (explain it), but maybe the \\'how\\' is up to them. So this might be explicit but the action is somewhat concrete since they need to provide reasoning.\\n\\nThird part: The selection criteria question. The reviewer is questioning why certain thresholds (60 tokens, 5 steps) were chosen. Again, this is a direct question prompting the authors to justify their criteria. The action is to explain their selection, which is explicit. The how is up to the authors, but the action is clear. \\n\\nPutting it all together: The first suggestion is explicit and concrete (table to compare methods). The other two are explicit questions that require the authors to provide explanations. Since the questions are direct, they are explicit actions. The actions themselves are concrete because the authors know exactly what they need to address (create a table, explain the assumption, justify the selection criteria). However, the first part about the table\\'s dimensions might be a bit vague, but the main action (create a table) is clear. The other points are clear in their required actions. \\n\\nComparing to the scale: \\n\\n- For the table suggestion, it\\'s explicit and concrete (score 5). \\n- The questions are explicit but the actions are to address those points, which are also concrete (since the authors know exactly which parts to explain). \\n\\nThe overall comment has multiple explicit and concrete actions. The only possible vagueness is in the first point\\'s \"different dimensions\" which might require the authors to figure out which dimensions to include. However, the core action (create a table comparing methods) is clear. Since the majority of the actions are explicit and concrete, this should be a 5. Wait, but the example given for 5 includes specific metrics or steps, like \"report averages over multiple runs and report some more modern metrics as well like COMET or BLEURT.\" Here, the table\\'s dimensions aren\\'t specified, so maybe it\\'s a 4? Because the \\'how\\' of the table\\'s content is left to the authors, making it somewhat vague. \\n\\nAlternatively, the reviewer might expect the authors to determine the relevant dimensions themselves, which is part of their responsibility. Since the action is explicit (draw a table) and the authors can figure out the dimensions, perhaps it\\'s still a 5. The questions are also explicit and require direct responses, so all parts are actionable. \\n\\nHmm. The first part is explicit and concrete (create a table), so that\\'s a 5. The other parts are also explicit and require specific explanations. So overall, this should be a 5. But wait, the scale says 5 is explicit and concrete. The questions are explicit (they are direct requests to explain), and the action is clear (answer the questions). Therefore, all three parts are explicit and concrete. \\n\\nWait, but the second and third points are phrased as questions. The aspect description says that clarification questions are treated as explicit if they give a direct action. Since the reviewer is asking the authors to address these points, it\\'s a direct action to provide explanations. Therefore, these are explicit and concrete. \\n\\nSo the entire review point is highly actionable (5). However, maybe the first part\\'s \"different dimensions\" is a bit vague, but the main action is clear. So I think this is a 5. But let me check the examples again. \\n\\nLooking at the example for 5: \"Given that this is a rare entity prediction problem, it would help to look at type-level accuracies, and analyze how the accuracies of the proposed models vary with frequencies of entities.\" Here, the reviewer specifies exactly what to do. \\n\\nIn our case, the first suggestion is to draw a table comparing methods across different dimensions. The dimensions aren\\'t specified, but the authors can choose relevant ones. However, the action is explicit and the method (table) is concrete.

Actionability is about how clear and specific the instructions are for the authors. The scale goes from 1 (unactionable) to 5 (highly actionable). The key factors are whether the action is explicit or implicit, and concrete or vague.\\n\\nStarting with the first part: \"The link between IP and the terms/equations could be explained more explicitly and prominently.\" The reviewer is pointing out that the connection isn\\'t clear enough. The suggestion here is to make that link more explicit. This is an explicit action because the reviewer is directly telling the authors to explain the link better.

The action is explicit but the method to do it isn\\'t fully detailed. So this part might be a 3 or 4.\\n\\nThe second part is: \"Pls include labels for subfigures in Figs 3 and 4, and not just state in the captions.\" This is very explicit.

The first part is explicit but a bit vague on the method, while the second is explicit and concrete. Since the scale considers both parts of the review point, I need to balance them. The second part is a 5, the first part is maybe a 4 (since it\\'s explicit but the \"how\" is still somewhat up to the authors). The overall score would lean towards the higher of the two or an average. Since the second part is very concrete and explicit, and the first is still actionable even if a bit vague, the total might be a 4 or 5. \\n\\nWait, the first part\\'s action is to explain the link more explicitly.

The second is explicit and concrete. Since the second part is a 5, and the first is a 4, the overall might be a 4.5, but since we can\\'t have half points, maybe 4 or 5. The key is that the reviewer provided two actions, one of which is fully concrete. The first part\\'s explicitness is there, so maybe the overall is a 4. But wait, the first part is still an explicit action. The reviewer is telling them to make the link explicit. So maybe that\\'s explicit and concrete enough?

So perhaps that\\'s a 4 (implicit action but concrete? Wait, no. Wait the first part is explicit because the reviewer is telling them to do it. So explicit and concrete? Or explicit but vague?\\n\\nHmm, explicit vs. implicit. The first part is explicit because the reviewer is directly telling them to explain it more explicitly. The concrete vs vague part: once you know the action (explain the link), do you know how? The reviewer doesn\\'t say \"add a paragraph here\" but the authors can infer they need to add explanations in the relevant sections. So maybe it\\'s concrete enough. So maybe the first part is a 4 (explicit and concrete?), but the scale says explicit vs. implicit and concrete vs vague.

So first part is explicit.\\n\\nConcrete: Once action is identified, authors know exactly what to do and how. The first part\\'s action is to explain the link more explicitly. The \"how\" is up to the authors, but the action itself is clear. So maybe it\\'s explicit but the concrete part is not fully there. Because the authors might not know exactly where to add it or how to phrase it. So maybe it\\'s explicit but vague. Then that would be a 3. The second part is explicit and concrete (add labels to Figs 3 and 4). So the second part is a 5. The first part is explicit but vague (score 3). Since the review point has two separate actions, the overall score would be the average? Or take the lower one? The aspect says \"the review point\" as a whole. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is explicit and concrete. Because the action is to explain the link more explicitly. The authors can take that and know they need to add explanations in the text where the terms/equations are presented. The exact method (adding a sentence here, a paragraph there) is up to them, but the action is clear. So maybe that\\'s explicit and concrete. So first part is 5? Wait, but the example for 5 includes \"give an example of inconsistency... such as models get ranked differently\". So the reviewer here is telling them to explain the link more explicitly. That\\'s explicit, but the \"how\" is not specified. So maybe it\\'s explicit but the concrete part is not there. So explicit (so not implicit) but vague (since they need to figure out how to do it). So that would be a 3 (explicit but vague). \\n\\nThe second part is explicit and concrete (add labels to Figs 3 and 4). So that\\'s a 5. Since the review point includes both, the overall score would be between 3 and 5. Since the two parts are separate, maybe the higher score is given because one is a 5, but the other is a 3. But the scale is about the review point as a whole. Maybe the average would be around 4. But according to the instructions, \"there is no correlation between the aspect score and the length of the review point\". So each part is part of the same point. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is explicit but vague (score 3) and the second is explicit and concrete (score 5). The overall score would be 4 because it\\'s a combination. But the scale says \"the review point\" as a whole. Since part of it is a 5 and another part is a 3, perhaps the overall is 4. \\n\\nAlternatively, the first part\\'s action is explicit and concrete. Because the reviewer is telling them to explain the link more explicitly. The authors can do that by, for example, adding sentences that connect IP to the terms/equations in the relevant sections. The exact method is up to them, but the action is clear. So maybe that\\'s explicit and concrete, making it a 5. But the example given for 5 includes \"give an example of inconsistency, such as models ranked differently\". The current instruction is to explain the link more explicitly.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is talking about the experimental part where the paper uses different metrics for different OPE methods.

The key is to see if the reviewer is giving a clear, concrete suggestion or if it\\'s vague. The reviewer says, \"I hope the author can give some comments on the differences between the two sets of evaluation methods.\" That sounds like an explicit request. They want the authors to analyze and explain why the results vary between the two benchmark sets. \\n\\nNow, checking the criteria: Explicit vs. Implicit. Since the reviewer directly asks for comments on the differences, that\\'s explicit. Then, Concrete vs. Vague. The action here is to provide an analysis, which is a clear action. The authors know they need to discuss the reasons behind the differences observed in the figures. They might need to compare the metrics used, the nature of the benchmarks, or other factors affecting the results. The reviewer isn\\'t telling them exactly how to do it, but the task itself is concrete enough. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scale, this seems similar to the \"Highly Actionable\" examples where the reviewer specifies an action.

However, the core action is clear: they need to analyze and explain the differences. Since the reviewer is pointing out that the differences are present and asking for an explanation, the authors can perform that analysis. The comment is explicit in the action and the direction. \\n\\nLooking at the scale: \\n\\n- Score 5 requires explicit and concrete. The reviewer is explicit in asking for comments, but the \"how\" is up to the authors. But the action itself is clear. However, maybe it\\'s more like \"explicit but the execution is up to the authors,\" so maybe it\\'s a 4? Wait, the scale says for 4: \"implicitly states an action but concretely states how to implement the inferred action.\" Hmm, maybe not. Let me check the examples again. \\n\\nLooking at the example for 4: \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y that other people have been comparing their results to.\" That\\'s implicit because it\\'s pointing out missing baselines, but the action is inferred. However, the example for 5 is \"Given that this is a rare entity prediction problem, it would help to look at type-level accuracies, and analyze how the accuracies of the proposed models vary with frequencies of entities.\" That\\'s explicit with concrete steps. \\n\\nIn our case, the reviewer is explicitly asking for comments, which is direct. The action is to analyze and explain the differences. The how might be up to the authors, but the task is clear. Since the reviewer is pointing out that the differences exist and wants an explanation, the authors can perform that analysis. The action is explicit and the task is clear, so maybe this is a 5? Wait, but the example for 5 has specific instructions like \"look at type-level accuracies\" which is very concrete.

The reviewer has several comments here. Let me go step by step.\\n\\nStarting with part 2.1.1: The paper claims that their approach has a \"picking\" step which is a distinction, but this aspect isn\\'t ablated. The reviewer points out this missing ablation. The action here would be for the authors to perform an ablation study on the \"picking\" step. That\\'s explicit because the reviewer is directly stating that an ablation is missing. The authors can take this and add that specific ablation. So that\\'s concrete and explicit.\\n\\nMoving to 2.2: The experiments on CIFAR aren\\'t convincing. The reviewer says the comparison is only against one approach (DEN) and that the continual learning literature has more. The action here is to include more baselines. But the reviewer doesn\\'t specify which ones exactly, just mentions that the current comparison is insufficient. This part is a bit vague because while the action is to add more baselines, the reviewer doesn\\'t name specific ones. However, the reviewer does mention that the authors should use the same setup as the DEN paper for a fair comparison. That part is more concrete because they specify using the same setup. \\n\\nIn 2.2.2, the reviewer is concerned about whether DEN was correctly used/evaluated. They suggest using the same setup as the original DEN paper to ensure fairness. This is explicit and concrete because they tell the authors exactly how to adjust their experiments (replicate the DEN setup). \\n\\nPutting it all together: \\n\\n- The first part (2.1.1) is explicit and concrete. The authors need to add an ablation study on the \"picking\" step. \\n\\n- The second part (2.2 and 2.2.1) is a bit more implicit but still actionable. The reviewer says to compare with more baselines, but doesn\\'t list them. However, the suggestion to use the same setup as DEN is concrete. The main action here is to include more baselines from the literature and ensure the setup is consistent with prior work. \\n\\n- The third part (2.2.2) is explicit and concrete. They need to verify their use of DEN by replicating the original setup. \\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s comments are mostly explicit where they can be, and the concrete parts are when they mention specific actions like adding an ablation, using the same setup as DEN, and possibly checking if other baselines are included.

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is talking about the experimental section and mentions that the standard deviation from multiple experiments isn\\'t provided. They note that the improvement from SoRA over the baseline is small and might just be due to random fluctuations. The reviewer suggests the author should clarify which effects are within the standard deviation and which are actual improvements from SoRA.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out the actionability here. The two main criteria are explicit vs. implicit and concrete vs. vague. \\n\\nStarting with explicit vs. implicit: The reviewer is explicitly asking the author to provide standard deviations and clarify which results are statistically significant versus random fluctuations. So that\\'s an explicit action. \\n\\nNext, concrete vs. vague: The reviewer specifies that the author should clarify which effects are within the standard deviation and which are improvements. That gives a clear direction. The author knows they need to include standard deviations in their results and perform some sort of statistical analysis (like confidence intervals or hypothesis testing) to distinguish between random fluctuations and actual improvements. \\n\\nIs there any vagueness here? The reviewer doesn\\'t say exactly how to do the analysis, but the action itself is clear. The author knows they need to report standard deviations and analyze the results to separate signal from noise. The \"how\" might be up to the author, but the \"what\" is explicit. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scale: \\n\\nA score of 5 requires explicit and concrete actions. The example given for 5 includes specific metrics (like using COMET or BLEURT) and clear steps (averages over multiple runs). Here, the reviewer is asking for standard deviations and clarification, which are specific. \\n\\nBut wait, the reviewer says \"the author should clarify which effects are within the range of standard deviation fluctuations...\" That\\'s a bit of an analysis step. The author might need to compute standard deviations, present them, and then discuss which differences are statistically significant. The reviewer didn\\'t mention statistical tests, but that\\'s a common way to address this. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the reviewer expects the author to add error bars with standard deviations and discuss the variance. Since the reviewer is pointing out that the improvement might be due to random fluctuations, the author needs to show that the improvements are beyond the standard deviation. \\n\\nSo the action is explicit (add standard deviations and clarify), and the method to do so is concrete enough (compute and present standard deviations, perform statistical analysis if needed). Therefore, this seems like a 5. \\n\\nWait, but let me check the scale again. The 4 is when the action is implicit but concrete. Wait, no: \\n\\nActionability Scale:\\n\\n4: Mostly Actionable - Implicit action but concrete implementation. \\n\\n5: Explicit and concrete. \\n\\nIn this case, the reviewer is explicitly stating the action (provide standard deviation, clarify which effects are within SD). So that\\'s explicit. The concrete part is that they need to report SD and analyze. So the action is explicit and concrete, so 5. \\n\\nWait, but in the example for 5, like \"explain how you achieved the values to the many parameters\" is explicit and concrete. Here, the reviewer is saying \"clarify which effects are within the range of standard deviation fluctuations and which are improvements\". The \"clarify\" part requires the author to perform an analysis, which is a concrete step. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it\\'s 4? Let me see another example. \\n\\nLooking at the example for 4: \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y that other people have been comparing their results to.\" That\\'s implicit because it\\'s suggesting adding baselines but not explicitly saying \"add X and Y\". Wait, but in the example given for 4, the reviewer mentions specific baselines (X and Y), so that\\'s explicit. Wait, no, actually the example says \"there are some very relevant baselines like X and Y...\" which is an implicit suggestion to include them. Wait the example for 4 is: \\n\\nExample 4: \"There are some very relevant baselines like X and Y that other people have been comparing their results to.\" \\n\\nSo that\\'s implicit (the action is to add those baselines) but the concrete part is that the baselines are named, so the action is concrete. \\n\\nIn our case, the reviewer is explicitly telling the author to do two things: provide standard deviations and clarify which effects are due to SD vs. SoRA. So that\\'s explicit. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5. \\n\\nWait, but another example for 5 is \"report averages over multiple runs and report some more modern metrics like COMET or BLEURT.\" That\\'s explicit and concrete. \\n\\nIn our case, the reviewer is saying to provide standard deviations (explicit) and clarify the effects (explicit). So yes, that\\'s explicit and concrete. \\n\\nTherefore, the score should be 5. \\n\\nWait, but let me check another example. The example for 3 is \"You should address the lack of technical novelty in this paper.\" That\\'s explicit but vague because it doesn\\'t say how. \\n\\nIn our case, the reviewer is telling them to provide standard deviations and clarify the effects. The how is to compute SD and do statistical analysis. Since that\\'s a standard procedure, the reviewer doesn\\'t need to spell it out. So the action is explicit and concrete. \\n\\nTherefore, the score is 5. \\n\\nWait, but maybe the reviewer didn\\'t explicitly say \"compute standard deviations\", but the first sentence says \"the standard deviation after multiple experiments is not provided.\" So the reviewer is pointing out that SD isn\\'t there, so the author needs to add them. That\\'s explicit. Then the second part is to clarify which effects are within SD fluctuations vs. actual improvements. So adding SD and then discussing that in the text. \\n\\nYes, so the author knows exactly what to do: include standard deviations in the results and analyze whether the improvements are statistically significant beyond the variance. \\n\\nTherefore, this is a 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Rationale:**  \\nThe reviewer explicitly points out that the experimental section lacks standard deviations and questions whether the observed improvements of SoRA over the baseline are statistically significant or due to random fluctuations. They directly instruct the authors to provide standard deviations and clarify which effects are within the range of random fluctuations versus genuine improvements. The actions required are clear and concrete: (1) include standard deviations in the experimental results and (2) perform an analysis (e.g., statistical tests) to distinguish between noise and meaningful improvements. While the reviewer does not specify the exact statistical methods to use, the need to report standard deviations and interpret results in light of variance is explicit and actionable. The authors can directly implement these steps without ambiguity.  \\n\\n**Score:** 5  \\n**Reason:** The comment is explicit in its request (provide standard deviations and clarify effects) and concrete in the required actions (report variance metrics and analyze results to distinguish signal from noise).

      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is pointing out some issues with the paper\\'s explanations and terminology. The first part is about the term \"upper faces\" of the convex hull and mentions that the dual subdivision and projection π need better explanation. The second part is about the variable \\'p\\' not being defined, which is a problem because it\\'s used a lot. The reviewer suggests moving the definition.\\n\\nStarting with the \"upper faces\" part. The reviewer is confused about what exactly the authors mean by that term. They also think the dual subdivision and π (projection) aren\\'t explained well. The action here would be for the authors to clarify these terms. Since the reviewer is asking for better explanations, that\\'s an implicit action. The authors need to infer they should add or improve definitions. But the reviewer isn\\'t specific about how exactly to explain them, just that they need better explanation. So the action is clear but the method isn\\'t detailed. \\n\\nThen, the variable \\'p\\' isn\\'t defined. The reviewer says this is problematic because it\\'s used extensively. They explicitly state that moving the definition would make sense. Wait, actually, the reviewer says \"It would make sense to move def.\" Maybe they mean move the definition earlier in the paper? The wording is a bit unclear, but the key point is that \\'p\\' needs to be defined where it\\'s first used. The reviewer is pointing out an explicit issue here. The action is explicit: define \\'p\\' and possibly move its definition. \\n\\nSo breaking down the actionability criteria. For the first part (upper faces, dual subdivision, π), the action is implicit but the need is clear. The authors know they need to explain these terms better, but how exactly? Maybe rephrase, add examples, or reference a definition. Since the reviewer didn\\'t specify the exact method, it\\'s a bit vague. \\n\\nFor the \\'p\\' variable, the reviewer is more direct. The variable isn\\'t defined where it\\'s first used, so the action is explicit: define \\'p\\' where it\\'s introduced. The suggestion to \"move def\" might mean the definition exists elsewhere but should be moved. The authors can take that as an explicit instruction to ensure \\'p\\' is defined early. \\n\\nSo combining both parts: the first part is implicit but actionable, the second is explicit. The overall actionability is a mix. The \"upper faces\" part is somewhat actionable (maybe a 3?), but the \\'p\\' part is explicit and concrete. \\n\\nLooking at the scale: \\n\\n- For the terms needing better explanation: implicit action (since the reviewer is asking for better explanations but not telling exactly how), but the action is clear. So that might be a 4 (mostly actionable) because the action is implicit but the how is concrete (they need to explain these terms better, which is a concrete task even if the method isn\\'t specified). \\n\\nWait, the scale says that 4 is \"implicitly stated action but concretely states how to implement the inferred action\". Hmm. The first part here: the reviewer says \"need to be explained better\". The action is to explain better, but the \"how\" isn\\'t given. So maybe that\\'s still vague? \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the \"how\" is inferred: the authors can add definitions or examples. So the action is concrete in that the authors know they need to explain those terms, even if the exact method isn\\'t specified. So maybe that\\'s a 4? \\n\\nThe \\'p\\' variable is explicit and concrete. The reviewer says \"move def\", which is a specific instruction. So that part is a 5. \\n\\nBut the review point combines both issues. Since the two parts are separate, but in one review point, how do they average? The overall score would depend on the combination. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part is a 3 (explicit action but vague how?), but no, the first part\\'s action is implicit. Wait, let\\'s re-examine the criteria:\\n\\nActionability is based on two criteria: explicit vs implicit and concrete vs vague. \\n\\nFirst part (upper faces etc): \\n\\n- The action is implicit (they have to infer that they need to explain better). \\n\\n- The \"how\" is vague? Because the reviewer doesn\\'t say exactly how to explain better. So the action is implicit and vague? Then that would be a 2 (borderline). \\n\\nBut the second part (variable \\'p\\'):\\n\\n- The action is explicit (\"define p, move def\") so explicit. \\n\\n- The how is concrete? Because moving the definition is a concrete action. So that\\'s a 5. \\n\\nBut since the review point combines both issues, perhaps the score is the higher of the two? Or average? The scale instructions say to evaluate the review point as a whole. \\n\\nAlternatively, the reviewer is making two separate points here. The first part (terms needing explanation) is implicit but actionable. The second part (define p) is explicit and concrete. \\n\\nThe second part alone would be a 5. The first part might be a 4? Let me think again. \\n\\nWait, the first part\\'s action is implicit (the reviewer is asking for better explanation, so the action is to explain better). The \"how\" is not specified, but the action itself is clear (explain the terms). So according to the scale, if the action is implicit but the how is concrete, then it\\'s a 4. But here, the how is not specified. \\n\\nWait, the \"concrete vs vague\" is after the action is identified. Once the action is inferred, is the action itself concrete? \\n\\nFor the first part: The action is to explain the terms better. Once you know that, do you know how to do it? The reviewer hasn\\'t said \"add a figure\" or \"define in Section X\", so the how is still vague. So the action is implicit and vague, making it a 2. \\n\\nBut the second part: the action is explicit (define p, move the def) which is explicit and concrete (the how is moving the definition). So that\\'s a 5. \\n\\nSince the review point combines both, but the second part is explicit and concrete, perhaps the overall score is 4? Or maybe the reviewer\\'s main point is that both need to be addressed, so the average between 2 and 5? \\n\\nAlternatively, since the review point includes both, but the second part is a clear 5, and the first part is a 2, but maybe the overall is 3? \\n\\nHmm, the instructions say \"there is no correlation']\n",
      "['Okay, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is asking about the rationale behind two specific design choices in Figure 1 of the paper.

The key points are whether the comment is explicit vs. implicit and concrete vs. vague. The reviewer is directly asking for explanations (rationales) for these design decisions.

However, the implication is that the authors need to provide these rationales in the paper.

The reviewer is pointing out that the current explanations aren\\'t sufficient, so the authors should add or clarify the reasoning behind these design choices. The action is to include more details on why the timbre encoder is separate and why SADTW uses the content encoder. \\n\\nNow, is the action concrete?

Since the reviewer specifies exactly which parts (a and b), the authors know exactly what to address. \\n\\nTherefore, this comment is explicit and concrete. The authors need to explain the reasons behind these two design choices. They can do this by adding text in the relevant sections. There\\'s no ambiguity in what needs to be done. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scale, this seems similar to the 5-point examples where specific actions are clearly stated.

Here, the reviewer is asking for specific rationales on specific components, which is more concrete. \\n\\nWait, but the action here is to provide explanations rather than a change in the method. But the purpose is to help authors improve their draft. Providing better explanations is a valid action.

While framed as a question, the comment implicitly instructs the authors to provide detailed rationales for these choices in their manuscript. The action is concrete because the reviewer specifies exactly which components require explanation and why (to address potential gaps in clarity for readers). The authors know precisely where to focus their revisions: they must elaborate on the theoretical or empirical justifications for these architectural decisions in the relevant sections of the paper.

Let\\'s break it down using the criteria given.\\n\\nExplicit vs. Implicit: The reviewer is pointing out a flaw in the authors\\' reasoning and is asking them to provide a gradient comparison between PCC and KL.

       "'Alright, let\\'s tackle this review point. The reviewer is asking the authors to explain how they determined the values for several model parameters in Section 4.3. The parameters listed are word embedding size, GRU hidden states, alpha, beta 1 and 2, epsilon, and beam size. \\n\\nFirst, I need to assess the actionability based on the criteria given. Actionability is about whether the comment gives clear, concrete steps the authors can take. The two main aspects are explicit vs. implicit and concrete vs. vague.\\n\\nThe reviewer\\'s request is explicit because they are directly telling the authors to explain the parameter values. They are not just hinting or implying; they\\'re stating an action the authors should perform. The question is, is this concrete? The reviewer specifies exactly which parameters need explanation. The authors know exactly which parameters to address. The action here is to provide an explanation for each of these parameters\\' values. \\n\\nHowever, the comment doesn\\'t specify how to present this information. Should the authors add a paragraph in the section? Include a table? Discuss hyperparameter tuning processes? The \"how\" of executing the action isn\\'t detailed. But the key point is that the reviewer has clearly identified the parameters that need explanation. The authors can take action by detailing their choices for each parameter, perhaps in the methods section or through supplementary material. \\n\\nComparing to the examples given in the scale, this is similar to the hyperparameter tuning example in the score 4. The reviewer is implying that the authors should add this explanation, which is an implicit action, but the parameters are concrete. Wait, no, actually, the reviewer is explicitly stating that they should explain these values. So maybe it\\'s explicit. Let me check the definitions again.\\n\\nExplicit actions are direct. The reviewer says \"Explain how you achieved the values...\" which is a direct instruction. So that\\'s explicit. The question is, is it concrete? The action is to explain the parameter values. The authors know exactly what needs to be done: they need to provide a rationale or methodology for selecting each parameter\\'s value. The \"how\" here is about the explanation, not the technical implementation. Since the reviewer specifies exactly which parameters, the action is concrete. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5? Wait, but let me check the examples again. The example for 5 is when the comment contains an explicit action with concrete details. For instance, the example where the reviewer suggests adding an example of inconsistency in the abstract. Here, the reviewer is explicitly telling the authors to explain the parameter values. The parameters are listed, so it\\'s very clear. The authors know exactly what to do: go through each parameter and explain their chosen values. \\n\\nComparing to the hyperparameter tuning example in the previous review points, where the score was 4 because it was implicit but concrete. Here, since the instruction is explicit and the parameters are specified, this is more like a 5. \\n\\nWait, the hyperparameter example in the previous review was: \"Section 5 describes the training procedure... it would be helpful to understand how they were selected.\" The rationale there was that it\\'s implicit because it doesn\\'t explicitly say \"you should provide this information,\" but the action is clear. Here, the instruction is explicit: \"Explain how you achieved the values...\" So that\\'s more direct. \\n\\nTherefore, this should be a 5. The action is explicit (direct instruction) and concrete (specific parameters listed, clear what to explain). The authors can follow this exactly. So the score is 5.\\n</think>\\n\\n    rationale: The reviewer explicitly instructs the authors to explain how specific parameter values (word embedding size, GRU hidden states, alpha, beta 1 and 2, epsilon, beam size) were determined in Section 4.3. The action is direct (\"Explain how you achieved the values...\"), and the parameters to address are clearly listed. This provides authors with a concrete task: they must detail their methodology or rationale for selecting each parameter\\'s value. While the reviewer does not specify *how* to present this information (e.g., in a table or paragraph), the core action (providing explanations for each parameter) is unambiguous and actionable. Because the instruction is explicit and the parameters are explicitly named, the comment is fully actionable.  \\n    score: 5'"
